23011,FAKE NEWS WEEK: Exposing The Mainstream Consensus Reality Complex," In response to the establishment media s contrived  fake news  crisis designed to marginalise independent and alternative media sources of news and analysis, 21WIRE is running its own #FakeNewsWeek awareness campaign, where each day our editorial team at 21st Century Wire will feature media critiques and analysis of mainstream corporate media coverage of current events   exposing the government and the mainstream media as the real purveyors of  fake news  throughout modern history Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireSome things never change. In the 21st century, people in power are still attacking independent voices for speaking up for what they believe, and for sharing their opinions.The first time I heard the term  fake news  uttered in unison from the mouths of mainstream media pundits, the irony was overtaken by the absurdity of it. It was beyond outrageous, and hearing it coming from the mainstream media was bordering on vaudeville. After watching and analyzing decades of media deception and government-issued press releases masquerading as hard news, and then to see the establishment attempting to force-feed this meme down our collective mainstream feeding tube, I suppose that would make the old editorial board at Soviet Izvestia wince (not that they were any worse than CNN is today).Sure it s laughable, but it s also incredibly sad to watch otherwise well-educated, smart and intelligent media professionals get so caught up in the political comedy-tragedy that was the 2016 Election   they volunteered en mass to abandon their senses and any semblance of journalistic objectivity, in order to join in a virtual witch-hunt. This was a new low-point for mainstream media, and for America.This topic is vast and growing more controversial by the day. There s a lot to unpack and we know, based on past performance, the mainstream media can t be trusted to do an objective job, much less critique itself. Their conversation is completely out of order. To help right this process, 21WIRE has launched Fake News Week to help educate the public on aspects of this important issue which will most certainly be ignored by the establishment media. Throughout this week, we will present a number well-researched articles cataloguing actual fake news and demonstrating this is a mainstream problem, and one as old as the media itself.The Story of Fake NewsSince the dawn of mass media in the 20th century, media propaganda has been steadily advancing in western societies. This process is being accelerated through technology. If you are waiting for the mainstream media to finally get together for some mass-mea culpa or have one giant come to Jesus moment, then you ll just be waiting for Godot. No, instead of reigning itself in, they have constructed an elaborate straw man instead, which they are calling  fake news. With the passage of the US presidential election, many thought that the  fake news  meme would die off. Instead, the Establishment is doubling down on it, in hysterical fashion.We re told that the real problem started because of an unlikely  fake news  cottage industry, supposedly run out of the Balkans, in a little Macedonian village called Velles (if we are to take The Guardian and BuzzFeed s word for it, anyway), where enterprising eastern European teens started pumping out countless fake news articles, making use major social media platforms to propel their articles. That s right, there was actual fake news circulating on Facebook, but calling it news is a bit of an overstatement. If one were to accurately label it, it would just be called junk.It was in late September that I first noticed all of these fake news posts pouring into nearly every Facebook news groups I subscribed to. I began collecting links from about 50 URLs in a vain attempt construct a database in order to work out where it was coming from, who was behind it, and what was the object of the exercise. At first thing I thought,  how could anyone take any of these seriously? Everyone is used to junk on Facebook, but these were ridiculous. One of the silliest stories was this one: Hillary Clinton Buying Illegal Weapons  Kremlin Reports.  Granted, you d have to be a real fool to take articles like that seriously, and yet, this is what mainstream media and academia are doing. They have made these obviously bogus internet posts into the pretext for a centralized system of control, arbitrated by Facebook and others, with the remit of deciding a  baseline  for what is true and what is deemed as fake news.As it turns out, during the election cycle and every day since, the only people who took these stories seriously were the mainstream media and still disgruntled Clinton supporters   both of whom are insisting, baselessly, that these spoof stories somehow swung the US election. Sure, there is a radical minority of short attention span web surfers and 3am Reddit junkies who would grab and run with these type of stories, but I would think that most normal people would have thought,  What idiot would believe any of these.  By November, my database of fake news and  election news  websites was approach 300. It became clear that new websites were being launched almost daily. These sites had a few things in common; all were over-loaded with Click Bait pop-up ads, and many of them carried malicious malware. Undoubtedly, the owners of these faux news sites had been raking-in a fortune in CMP ad revenues based on traffic that was not so much driven by genuine interest, but rather out of entertainment-based curiosity, and possibly a depraved desire to shock friends and loved ones with crazy online stories. The real damage was subtle  by flooding social media with junk, they would rapidly push real independent news and alternative media articles down the page s timeline, and into cyber limbo.Qui bono? Certainly, the establishment media, watching their main competition   real independent media outlets, drowning in a cesspool of internet flotsam and jetsam of fake Trump and Hillary  articles.  Just like those cheap Chinese knock-offs at your local flea market, someone aped the alternative media, devaluing and damaging it in the process. If only it had ended there On Nov 18, 2016, I woke up to an inbox full of friends and colleagues informing me that this website, 21stCenturyWire.com, had been featured in the L.A. Times expos  on  fake news   the first major blacklist of  fake news  websites featured in the mainstream media entitled,  Want to keep fake news out of your newsfeed? College professor creates list of sites to avoid.  A number of these blacklists have appeared online for a number of years, but this was the first time such a list was given credence by a mainstream publication.The list was created by one Melissa Zimdars, an academic and radical progressive-liberal activist, who teaches  media studies  from Merrimack College in Massachusetts. The story was quickly syndicated all over the globe, including spinoff reports by CNN and The Guardian. Not surprisingly, the author of the article was another liberal activist, a journalist named Jessica Roy. Like Zimdars, Jessica Roy is a feminist activist, and had previously used her position as a mainstream journalist to produce hit pieces promoting a radical liberal social agenda. Both Roy and Zimdars appear to support many of the same causes and are pushing similar political campaigns on social media, and were likely committed Hillary Clinton supporters too. With that in mind, both Roy and Zimdars were probably very unhappy about 21WIRE s harsh criticism of Secretary Clinton s tenure as head of the US State Department under Obama from 2009-2013, and probably were not chuffed either that we called the establishment s official  Russian Hack  conspiracy theory a hoax during the presidential campaign. Both of those articles went viral in the week before the election.Many other excellent and reputable independent news sites were also on the list, but were intentionally placed alongside well-known satire websites, as well as with obvious poorly crafted  fake news  sites. I seriously wondered if Dr Zimdars, a professor in media studies, thought so little of her own students that they should require her professional guidance to tell them that the The Onion is not a real news site. She also lists other satirical websites like Britain s Private Eye on her list. Less than two days after the article appeared, Zimdars removed Private Eye from the list (probably after getting an email from their legal department). Here we can see she has thrown a variety of people into one giant basket (of deplorables), thus branding everyone with the same derogatory label of  fake news  or its progenitor,  conspiracy theory. What s worse however, is that Merrimack College s Melissa Zimdars appears to have lifted her celebrated list from a wacky left-wing blog site who had haphazardly cobbled the original list together (no visible methodology as to the selection process) and which had been fermenting up online for quite some time, long before Dr Zimdars was elevated by the LA Times and CNN. Not exactly academic, but the culture cops don t seem to care.Regardless, one would hope that any conscientious professional would agree that Zimdars  effort, or lack thereof, was a foolhardy attempt at passing off a politically-motivated virtual book burning list as a study.  It would be unacceptable for any undergraduate, or graduate student, much less something submitted as course material by a professor. And, to think that her students would pay thousands of dollars in course fees for Dr. Zimdars to teach them how to surf the internet. Is the bar really that low? I can t help but wonder how many of those students also signed-up for Critical Thinking 101.Judging by the amount of right-wing websites on her list, it s clear this was a political hit piece. That was the intention of article author Jessica Roy, evidenced by the fact that she offered no specifics of why any of these sites were on the list, nor did she challenge Dr Zimdars. Whatever it was, it was not journalism.A few days later, after the article in question was published in the LA Times, the paper removed the PDF image of the list, stating  fears and threats  as the reason for its disappearance. Their editor issued this statement: The professor who created the list has taken down the Google doc. She said it was a safety measure in response to threats and harassment she and her students and colleagues had received. She is continuing to work on it and plans to release it in the future in a format other than a Google doc. It s hard to keep up with Dr Zimdars  definitive guide to the internet because she has revised and changed so many times. Here is a version from January 2017:2017-DR ZIMDARS   False, Misleading, Clickbait-y, and Satirical  News  Sources   Google DocsSoon after, I contacted the LA Times, asking their editorial board for the right to reply in my own defense in their opinion section, citing my belief that Roy and Zimdars had created a politicized piece which was hardly fair and balanced, and was designed to slander and discredit all of the websites on their list. I finally received a reply from Larry Ingrassia at the LA Times. The paper s excuse for denying me a right of reply was weak and evasive. Ingrassia stated to me that:Ingrassia s claim that my website is not mentioned in the article was not true.  In fact, 21stCenturyWire.com appeared at the very top of the list in the database table image of Zimdars  list in the article. Just because it wasn t in the text of the article doesn t mean it wasn t still visible to millions of readers. Likewise, just because the LA Times had later removed the database table image from the article, and replaced it with a hyperlink to Zimdars  Google Doc, is no excuse either   because the list was up on the LA Times website, and was widely syndicated during that time.As it happened, I did email Dr Zimdars immediately after seeing Jessica Roy s LA Times article asking her why she had included my website on her list, and to cite any specific news articles which she thought were  fake  or  conspiracy  and asked her to please remove 21stCenturyWire.com from her list. Not surprisingly, she did not reply to my request. Perhaps she realized that every one of the thousands of articles on our website contain either secondary, or primary source, and include more reference links than you will find on most mainstream media reports. For an academic who purports to hold so many persons and their websites accountable for being  fake news    when confronted about her work, she acts aloof and completely unaccountable. This further proves the point that this was not a study, but rather an activist campaign, done on the Merrimack College s dime.My experience with the LA Times was a disappointing one   seeing a paper running with a cheap politicized hit piece, and then being dismissive when asked for equal time on the issue. Such is the state of many leading American media institutions. If this is what passes for the Fourth Estate in today s America, then the country is in deep trouble.Mainstream TrollingA few days later, I was then contacted by one of the US mainstream media most established investigative news programs, NBC Dateline. It was clear from their correspondence that they wanted to draw me into another fake news hit piece. This is one of NBC Dateline s email to me:If was bad enough to be slandered by a major national news outlet, now I was being trolled by the country s largest broadcast TV network?My reply to NBC s Calabrese was long but polite, and at the end I simply asked her for specifics   in other words, what exactly were these  unconfirmed reports  she was accusing 21st Century Wire of publishing? As a reporter for a major outlet like NBC, I should rightly assume that she might be able to provide me with some substance, and not just an ad hominem accusation. Here is part of my reply: Our content is not  fake  and anyone with a basic understanding of geopolitics and media should be able to tell that. Many people like our work, and many I am sure do not like it. But the content should speak for itself. If you find some articles on our site that you feel are  Click Bait-y  or  fake news    then let me know and I would be more than happy to help and discuss your findings. Just like with Dr. Zimdars, I received no reply from NBC. This led me to conclude that they were not at all interested in having a candid discussion about the state of the media today, a discussion I offered to have. But NBC wasn t looking for a real conversation on media. Maybe they were just looking for an easy mark, someone to set-up and frame in a expos  on the scourge of  fake news.  Another drive-by, hit-and-run piece.This wasn t the first time. We ve had similar approaches before by the BBC and others, sometimes through a third party, and always looking to draw us into one of their discomfiting  conspiracy  features on their network.Whatever it is that NBC thought we did that warranted an NBC Dateline hit piece, surely it can t be any worse than NBC s disgraced anchorman Brian Williams, now widely regarded as a serial liar. If you expected the company would want to preserve some integrity by letting him go after that embarrassment, you d be wrong. The same with CNN, after it was revealed how many of their staff were colluding with the Clinton campaign. Was anyone fired? The only person they let go was Donna Brazile, who was only a contributor and not a real member of staff.This begs the question: are big mainstream media outlets really capable of policing themselves? The answer to that question might tell us why the mainstream media have a 14% approval rating according to a recent Gallop poll.Take the big network s Syria coverage for instance. What about its ridiculous coverage of the 7 year old human agit-prop Twitter sensation, Bana of Aleppo? What about NBC getting its reports exclusively from Nusra Front (al Qaeda in Syria) occupied East Aleppo, and then spreading exaggerated false claims of  a complete meltdown of humanity  when in reality the terrorist-held part of the city was being liberated by the Syrian government? Unlike NBC, a billion dollar media operation, little 21WIRE actually had journalists like Vanessa Beeley reporting from on the ground in Aleppo during this period. Unlike NBC, we were able to give our readers and listeners an accurate depiction of events   although maybe not the pro-terrorist, or  activist  version of events which the western mainstream media have relied on through six years of war in Syria, consistently and conveniently feeding the mainstream media what it wanted   a regime change  narrative which was streamlined with US State Department, CIA and British Foreign Office policy. Did it ever occur to them that someone should go and talk to Aleppo s residents? It did to us. We figured the terrorists already had plenty of media coverage, what with NBC, MSNBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, BBC, Channel 4, the New York Times, The Guardian and others all in tow.These mainstream outlets would never give any any credit to 21WIRE and Vanessa Beeley for its coverage in Syria, no matter good the reporting is   because we re not conveying the right  narrative, which is the Establishment s narrative. In that sense, we out-performed the entire mainstream media on one of the biggest stories of the last five years   the Liberation of Aleppo. Maybe that s why they are coming after us.Channelling McCarthy Clearly, the corporate mainstream media in America has attempted to blame Hillary Clinton s loss on  fake news.  Clinton herself called it  an epidemic.  Indeed, it is an epidemic, however the unwashed masses on the internet are not the source of that pandemic. They should be looking in the mirror   for colluding behind the scenes with the Clinton campaign, first to kill-off the Bernie Sanders nomination, before colluding in the general election, too, thus betraying the fundamental principles of a Fourth Estate. As bad as those outlets appear to be, they almost pale in comparison to this next incident On November 24, 2016, The Washington Post descended deep into the lower detritus of the DC swamp. This piece of propaganda was simply breathtaking. The journalist who drew the short straw for this job was none other than Craig Timberg, who is also a John S. Knight Journalism Fellow at Stanford University. It sounds impressive, until you see his work.In his feature entitled,  Russian propaganda effort helped spread  fake news  during election, Experts say,  Timberg placed The Post into a leading role in waging a new McCarthy-style witch hunt, targeting hundreds of independent websites and blogs, most of them American, accusing them of being part of a giant Russian conspiracy to undermine American democracy on behalf of the Kremlin. Experts say ? Did they really? Only, in this case, Timberg would name his  experts    a cadre of secret sources operating under the anonymous collective brand of PropOrNot. We re told that these patriots had to protect their identity for fear of retribution from Putin s equally secret army of hackers. What was this, other than a propaganda piece run by The Post, one which could just as easily be classed as actual  fake news. The flood of  fake news  this election season got support from a sophisticated Russian propaganda campaign that created and spread misleading articles online with the goal of punishing Democrat Hillary Clinton, helping Republican Donald Trump and undermining faith in American democracy, say independent researchers who tracked the operation,  wrote Timberg. Way back when, if a piece this bad managed to escape out into the public sphere, either the editor or the reporter would get the sack. No such luck here.Timberg s cloak and dagger source managed to slandered some 200 websites, including many well-established, popular  alternative news outlets like AntiWar.com, Counterpunch, Information Clearing House, OpEd News, Activist Post, Global Research.ca, Oriental Review, Truth-Out, Truth Dig, Zero Hedge, Consortium News (run by award-winning investigative journalist Robert Parry), Ron Paul Institute (headed by former US Congressman and Presidential candidate, Dr Ron Paul)) and Paul Craig Roberts (former Cabinet member under President Reagan), to name only a few from PropOrNot s list of alleged  Russian propaganda  collaborators, in an attempt to reverse engineer a virtual conspiracy   trying to link 200 popular alternative websites with a theoretical Russian plot. When you read the content on most of these websites, you can see a few common themes   nearly all of them were highly critical of U.S. foreign policy under the last three US Administrations of Clinton, Bush and Obama. Most were also critical of Hillary Clinton s chequered record as Obama s Secretary of State. They also challenged the prevailing anti-Russian party line in Washington. Here, The Washington Post is channelling the spirit of Joe McCarthy by promoting a  Blacklist of independent journalists and commentators. A political hit piece by The Post, that s all.Soon after the publication of Timberg s fictional feature, The Washington Post caved-in to pressure by critics, printing this retraction soon afterwards:Editor s Note: The Washington Post on Nov. 24 published a story on the work of four sets of researchers who have examined what they say are Russian propaganda efforts to undermine American democracy and interests. One of them was PropOrNot, a group that insists on public anonymity, which issued a report identifying more than 200 websites that, in its view, wittingly or unwittingly published or echoed Russian propaganda. A number of those sites have objected to being included on PropOrNot s list, and some of the sites, as well as others not on the list, have publicly challenged the group s methodology and conclusions. The Post, which did not name any of the sites, does not itself vouch for the validity of PropOrNot s findings regarding any individual media outlet, nor did the article purport to do so. Since publication of The Post s story, PropOrNot has removed some sites from its list.They must hold their readership in such utter contempt as to not care what people think about the paper. How sad. What kind of paper would run a gargantuan fake news story like that? Are they still a paper of record ?Here at 21WIRE, and unlike the Washington Post, we recognize that our readership is intelligent enough to spot what the LA Times and the Washington Post are serving up and calling news. Unlike the Washington Post, we are not trying to bury under endless column inches government-issued propaganda. Instead, we are trying to expose those lies of the mainstream s multibillion dollar consensus reality complex. Tune in, as each day this week we ll give you an original inside look into the inner workings of the mainstream media s fake news empire.

23012,"Trump Asks O’Reilly, ‘Do you think our country is so innocent?’ After Pundit calls Putin ‘a killer’","21st Century Wire says Regardless of what one thinks of Donald Trump, it must be tempting for most people to admit that it is refreshing to see a US President admit that the US isn t as  innocent  as some pundits and consumers of mainstream news might think.In an interview aired before the Super Bowl, FOX News host Bill O Reilly challenged President Trump s comments about working with Russia in the fight against ISIS. In doing so O Reilly called Putin  a killer.  Trump shrugged off the comment by saying,  There are a lot of killers. We ve got a lot of killers. What, do you think our country is so innocent? RT reports further on the interview below RTSeemingly surprised, O Reilly goes on to ask him why. He is the leader of his country. I say it s better to get along with Russia than not, and if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS   which is a major fight   and the Islamic terrorism all over the world, that s a good thing,  Trump answered. Will I get along with him? I have no idea. O Reilly then challenged Trump, calling the Russian president  a killer. Trump shrugged the comment off, saying:  There are a lot of killers. We ve got a lot of killers. What, do you think our country is so innocent? It is not the first time that Trump has made such comments when journalists question his stance regarding the Russian leader.At the end of 2015, the host of MSNBC s Morning Joe told Trump that Putin  kills journalists,  to which the unfazed then-presidential candidate replied,  I think that our country does plenty of killing, too, Joe. I ve always felt fine about Putin. He s a strong leader. He s a powerful leader,  Trump added.At the end of January, Putin and Trump held their first official phone call, which, according to the Kremlin, was  good and constructive. Over the past years, the lack of mutual respect became the main reason for the deterioration of relations,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov added.Another important thing is that Washington is prepared for dialogue, the spokesman concluded. This is what President Putin called for rather consistently but where unfortunately he did not see reciprocity over the past years,  Peskov said.Earlier in January, however, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov emphasized that the first meeting between Putin and Trump may  happen in months to come,  not  in a matter of weeks. Peskov also said,  it is maybe the biggest mistake on the part of Western analysts to think that Trump is  our man.  He is an American man. Former Deputy Speaker of the Belgian Parliament Lode Vanoost told RT that it is way too early to be overly optimistic about Trump. To me, he remains as unpredictable and unreliable as he was before. We didn t see the full interview yet, and the follow-up questions that came after this very astonishing remark. Basically, what Trump is doing is he is applying the same moral principles to the US as he applies to other countries. That is indeed without precedent in US political culture. Also, he expressed concern over forces that could interfere with Trump s mending ties with Russia Continue this report at RTREAD MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"February 6, 2017"
23013,The Court Case Against the ‘Travel Ban’ Executive Order,"21st Century Wire says The legal battle is waging on over President Trump s Executive Order Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the US when on Saturday the Department of Justice requested a lift of the stay placed on enforcement of the Executive Order. The federal appeal court denied the DoJ s request, noting the the plaintiffs should first be given an opportunity to respond. Contrary to what many media outlets are saying, this was not a case of the courts saying that the order is  unconstitutional  as the ACLU and a number of Attorney Generals are claiming, but is standard practice in appeals cases.The Duran provides some further legal analysis on this developing case below  Alexander Mercouris The DuranThe legal moves and counter-moves in the court case concerning Donald Trump s  travel ban  Executive Order may appear complicated, but in reality they follow standard practice.  Since there are some misunderstandings in reporting them I will provide a brief explanation.The federal judge in Seattle on Friday did not rule that the Executive Order is unconstitutional or illegal.  Rather he ordered a temporary two week stay on the enforcement of the Executive Order until this question of its legality is decided in further argument before him in two weeks time.In doing so the judge acted fully within his powers, though as I understand it he took a different view from a different federal judge in Massachusetts who apparently refused to grant a similar stay when he was asked to do so at roughly the same time that the judge in Seattle was making his decision.The Department of Justice is appealing the stay.  It is doing so on the grounds that the Executive Order is fully legal and constitutional and needs to be brought back into force immediately in order to protect the US from potential terrorists, who might take advantage of the stay to enter the US during the two week period when it is in effect.On Saturday the Department of Justice asked the federal appeal court in San Francisco (which will hear the appeal) to lift the stay.  The federal appeal court however refused to do so, saying that the plaintiffs who applied for the stay should be given an opportunity to respond.  It gave the plaintiffs until Sunday (ie. today) to file their objections to the Department of Justice s application to lift the stay, with the Department of Justice instructed to file its counter-objections on Monday (ie. tomorrow).Contrary to some media claims, this is completely standard practice during appeals.  It would be very unusual for an appeal court to set aside a judge s order   even a temporary order   without a full hearing, and the Department of Justice will undoubtedly have known this when it applied to the appeal court to have the stay lifted on Saturday.The reason the Department of Justice made the application on Saturday is because it wants to emphasise to the appeal court the urgency of the situation.  This is important, not just because of the danger of terrorists entering the US during the period of the stay, but because unless the appeal court is convinced of the urgency of the situation it will simply say that the Department of Justice should wait until the hearing ordered by the federal judge in Seattle in two weeks time.In other words by insisting that the stay be lifted immediately the Department of Justice is providing reasons to the appeal court to take the case out of the federal judge s hands, so that it can decide the case itself.  That was the true purpose of the application on Saturday, and it succeeded.I expect the appeal court in San Francisco to decide the appeal this week, possibly as soon as Tuesday or Wednesday.As I am not an expert in US constitutional law I do not know what the outcome of the appeal will be.  I should say that it would be completely wrong to try to guess the outcome from the decision the appeal court took on Saturday.The appeal will be purely on the question of the rightness or otherwise of the stay.  If the appeal decision goes against the President it will be for the Department of Justice to put his case to the federal judge at the full hearing in two weeks time.  If that decision also goes against the President, he can appeal again to the federal appeal court in San Francisco, and beyond that to the Supreme Court.By contrast if the Department of Justice wins the appeal this week then I would expect the plaintiffs to drop the case in Seattle and try to go directly to the Supreme Court.  Since the appeal court would have effectively affirmed the legality of the Executive Order, there would be little point in the plaintiffs continuing to contest the Executive Order before the federal judge in Seattle Continue this report at The DuranREAD MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"February 6, 2017"
23014,"Uber, Google, Twitter, Netflix and Other Tech Giants File ‘Unlawful’ Immigration Retort Against Trump","21st Century Wire says A group of top Silicon Valley tech companies have filed a rare legal brief stating Trump Administration s Executive Order on immigration is discriminatory and  departs dramatically from the principles that have governed our immigration law for decades. This legal filing follows the report Friday when a Federal Judge issued a temporarily restraining order blocking US Border Patrol, Customs and Immigration Services from enforcing President Trump s recent executive order, which bars entry to the U.S. to anyone coming from seven  majority Muslim  countries.This story and the leaked text of the legal challenge was a Washington Post exclusive on Sunday . Elizabeth Dwoskin Washington PostSilicon Valley is stepping up its confrontation with the Trump administration.On Sunday night, Google, Facebook, Uber, Twitter, Netflix and other prominent tech companies are planning to file legal brief opposing the administration s contentious entry ban, according to people familiar with the matter.The amicus brief is expected to be filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which is expected to rule within a few days on an appeal by the administration after a federal judge in Seattle issued late Friday a temporary restraining order putting the entry ban on hold. The brief comes at the end of a week of nationwide protests against the plan   as well as a flurry of activity in Silicon Valley, a region that sees immigration as central to its identity as an innovation hub.Companies backing the filing also include Pinterest, Yelp, Square, Reddit, Kickstarter, Github, Glassdoor, Box, Mozilla, Dropbox, Twilio, Zynga, Medium, Pinterest, and Salesforce, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the filing was still being finalized Sunday.Notably, it doesn t appear that Apple, Amazon, or Microsoft are party to the brief. The sources cautioned that the wording of the brief   and the participants   could still change before the filing is made Sunday night.A draft of the filing says that the entry ban, which barred individuals from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the U.S. for at least 90 days and suspended the U.S. refugee program, is discriminatory. The Order effects a sudden, seismic shift in the rules governing entry into the United States, and it departs dramatically from the principles that have governed our immigration law for decades,  a draft obtained by The Washington Post reads.  The Order discriminates on the basis of national origin and religion. It closes our borders to the world s most vulnerable people, such as those fleeing the devastation of war. And it establishes discretionary and arbitrary rules for admission to this country, even by immigrants who have lived here lawfully for years.

23016,Washington State Judge Issues Temporarily Block on Trump’s Immigration Ban Nationwide,"21st Century Wire says On Friday a US federal judge in Seattle ordered a temporary nationwide block on U.S. President Donald Trump s 7 nation immigration ban. As expected, the White House labeled the legal ruling outrageous  and promised the White House intends to file an emergency stay .Judge James Robart, appointed by former President George W. Bush in 2003, ruled on the President s executive order on immigration and US Customs and Border Protection has already alerted major airlines that the United States will start reinstating previously banned visas.The war of words between the Administration and the members of the judiciary has been stark.  The answer is none,  Judge Robart said.  You re here arguing we have to protect from these individuals from these countries, and there s no support for that.  The new lawsuit seeks to permanently block parts of Trump s recent executive order which suspend entry to US from 7  Muslim-majority  countries which include Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia.The complaint states that,  The executive order effectively mandates that the states engage in discrimination based on national origin and/or religion, thereby rescinding the states  historic protection of civil rights and religious freedom,  , calling it a violation of the U.S. Constitution.The US Department of Justice is expected to file the emergency stay on Saturday in defiance of Friday s ruling.Washington state s Attorney General, Bob Ferguson, issued a stark challenge to President Trump, saying, This decision shuts down the executive order right now. No one is above the law   not even the President . It s our president s duty to honor this ruling and I ll make sure he does,  added Ferguson.It is estimated that some 60,000 people from the affected countries had their visas cancelled.READ MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump Files",Middle-east,"February 4, 2017"
23017,Trump Administration Faces Flood of Lawsuits Over Executive Immigration Ban,"21st Century Wire says President Trump s Executive Order: Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the US, is under fire in the American legal system. The American Civil Liberties Union and multiple US State Attorney Generals are filing law suits against the Federal Government  lots of law suits.US District Court Judge, James Robart, issued a temporary restraining order against enforcement of the Trump Executive Order calling it un-lawful,   un-American  and  un-constitutional.  The White House has replied by saying that they believe the order is just and within the presidents constitutional authority and that at the earliest possible time the Department of Justice will file for a stay of the order.Are we about to see a legal battle to dwarf all legal battles? Do the ACLU and the agitated Attorney Generals have any legal feet to stand on a opposing Trump s Executive Order?RT reports below with more analysis on this situation  RTThe State Department, since being notified by the Justice Department of the ruling from the US District Court for the Western District of Washington, has been in contact with the Homeland Security Department and legal teams to coordinate operations, according to Reuters.Customs and Border Protection officials said they would reinstate visas in compliance with the order. At the earliest possible time, the Department of Justice intends to file an emergency stay of this order and defend the executive order of the President, which we believe is lawful and appropriate,  the White House said in a statement.  The president s order is intended to protect the homeland and he has the constitutional authority and responsibility to protect the American people. In response, the DOJ will not file an emergency stay request of the order Friday night, a spokesperson said, Reuters reported.Last Friday, Trump issued an executive order that banned citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the US. The rollout of the executive order caused mass confusion, deportations and protests. By Saturday, the lawsuits had begun, with at least 40 active lawsuits in 17 states.At the state level, Virginia, Washington, Minnesota, New York and Massachusetts have filed cases against the federal government. The attorneys general of 16 states and the District of Columbia issued a joint statement earlier this week calling the executive order  unconstitutional, un-American and unlawful. After 2 weeks in office, President Trump faces 50+ lawsuits, far more than his predecessors faced in that span https://t.co/NXMetwCLnj pic.twitter.com/2kERF2n7Ga  NPR (@NPR) February 3, 2017In California, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit that seeks class-action status, which New York and Massachusetts have joined. There are individual lawsuits in Georgia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Texas and elsewhere, NBC News reported. The lawsuits claim violations of the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, which guarantee religious equality, due process and equal protection under the law, as well as denials of asylum and discriminatory visa processing. We re being sued right now in 10 different courts. We re going to be sued tomorrow in 20 different courts, Erez Reuveni from the Justice Department s Office of Immigration Litigation told a Virginia judge on Friday.On Friday afternoon, a US District Court judge in Washington state ruled that the combined cases put forward by Washington and Minnesota provided evidence that the executive order has caused immediate harm. Judge James Robart also said that the lawsuit has substantial likelihood of success in challenging the constitutionality of the order, the Seattle Times reported.Robart asks DOJ's Bennett how many arrests of foreign nationals there have been from the 7 countries since 9/11. She says she doesn't know.  Sydney Brownstone (@sydbrownstone) February 3, 2017 The Constitution prevailed today, Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in a statement. No one is above the law   not even the President. On Monday, Ferguson became the first state attorney general to file a lawsuit against Trump, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and high-ranking Trump administration officials; on Wednesday, Minnesota joined the suit as a plaintiff. In their complaint, the states argued that the executive order was motivated by animus and a desire to harm a particular group, and that the discriminatory terms and application of the Executive Order are arbitrary and cannot be justified by federal interests. As such, the order is unconstitutional and violated the visa-holders  rights, they said.Robart s restraining order covers the whole country for at least two weeks until the preliminary injunction hearing, The Stranger reported. It also stops the government from enforcing the part of the ban that grants exemptions to non-Muslim refugees on the basis of their religion.Even @AGOWA Bob Ferguson seemed stunned at breadth of victory. ""Holy cow.. OK"" he said to colleagues following ruling #ImmigrationOrder  Jim Brunner (@Jim_Brunner) February 3, 2017Earlier on Friday, US District Court Judge Leonie M. Brinkema expanded and extended her order staying the enforcement of the travel restrictions in Virginia. She also allowed the commonwealth to join the lawsuit by Tareq and Ammar Aqel Mohammed Aziz, Yemeni brothers who are permanent legal residents and who were turned back at Dulles International Airport on Saturday. The two men said they were forced to sign forms giving up their status as lawful permanent residents against their will and without their knowledge or consent, according to court documents.Brinkema noted that, although the president has almost unfettered power when it comes to securing US borders, this is not  no limit. Sha also had harsh words for the executive order, which she said was was poorly planned and rolled out. It s quite clear that not all the thought went into it that should have gone into it, she said. There has been chaos   without any kind of actual hard evidence that there is a need to revoke visas that had already been granted.Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring praised the ruling outside the Alexandria courthouse, according to the Washington Post, saying he was really pleased the judge recognized real harm is happening in Virginia. Brinkema did not hold government officials in contempt for reportedly preventing immigrants access to lawyers, a violation of her previous order. She told the court that she didn t have enough information to make the contempt determination, even though Virginia had cited news reports and affidavits from lawmakers that US Customs and Border Patrol agents had not allowed attorneys access to the visa holders. There were so many lawyers there willing to help, and not a single one got access, Virginia Solicitor General Stuart Raphael said during the hearing.Brinkema also required that, by Thursday, the federal government provide Virginia with a list of all people with valid visas who were denied entry or removed from the US who had Virginia ties since the order was signed. At least 350 students at state universities, as well as professors and other employees, were affected by the executive order, Virginia officials said.On Thursday, the ACLU filed a lawsuit in a California federal district court, accusing the Trump administration of violating the religious freedom of those visa holders who were barred from entering the country. It proposes class-action status on behalf of nationals who are living or have lived in the United States and are from the seven countries listed in the executive order. Senior advisers to defendant Trump have engaged in anti-Muslim rhetoric that provides additional support for the notion that the executive order was prompted by animus toward Islam and Muslims, the suit said.New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced Tuesday that they would join lawsuits filed by the ACLU chapters in their respective states. As I ve made clear: President Trump s executive action is unconstitutional, unlawful, and fundamentally un-American, Schneiderman said in a statement. That is why my office will be filing to join the federal lawsuit against President Trump and his administration. I m proud to partner with these organizations to fight to permanently strike down this dangerous and discriminatory order. Although the Bay State has joined in the ACLU s lawsuit, Massachusetts state attorneys were in court seeking an extension to the seven-day restraining order against Trump s travel ban that was originally granted there on Sunday. US District Judge Nathaniel Gorton did not issue an extension, but is reviewing arguments and will rule by Sunday.However, Robart s nationwide restraining order provides coverage in case Gorton s ruling does not extend the local stay.I don't wake up every day looking for a way to sue Donald Trump. But we are 10 days in and I've filed three cases already.  Maura Healey (@maura_healey) January 31, 2017 If an Executive Order looks like a Muslim ban, acts like a Muslim ban, and has been talked about as a Muslim ban, then it s probably a Muslim ban, Friday s complaint read.The initial lawsuit in the commonwealth was filed Sunday on behalf of two state university professors from Iran with green cards who were detained at Boston s Logan Airport on their way back from an academic conference. An amended complaint added six new plaintiffs, including several non-citizens legally in the US who are afraid they will be unable to return if they leave the country, WHDH reported.Indeed, visas for two of the plaintiffs   a doctoral student at the University of Massachusetts with family in Iran and a businesswoman who often travels to the US   have already been revoked, meaning they will not be allowed to return to the country if they leave, said Joshua Press, an attorney with the Department of Justice, according to the Boston Herald.In Virginia on Friday, Reuveni said in court that 100,000 visas had been revoked as a result of the executive order. The number 100,000 sucked the air out of my lungs, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg of the Legal Aid Justice Center, who represents the Aziz brothers, told the Washington Post.However, the State Department later said the number was actually less than 60,000. The US government issues about 90,000 visas a year to people from the seven restricted countries. Some of those visas last longer than one year, so the overall number of people from the seven countries in the US is much higher.Reuveni also argued that, since Sunday, green-card holders no longer face any enhanced scrutiny when entering the country. However, other legal visa holders already in the US have had their visas revoked, and so will not be able to return if they leave, Virginia Elliott, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Consular Affairs at the State Department, told the Washington Post.On Sunday, DHS issued a blanket waiver for lawful permanent residents, ditching the case-by-case waivers that had been in operation prior. On Thursday, White House Counsel Don McGahn issued what he called  authoritative guidance  that green-card holders were not covered under Trump s executive order.What the government says is happening and what volunteers at airports are experiencing are not the same thing, however.Although immigration attorneys are legally allowed to give face-to-face legal counsel to permanent residents still in the secured area of airports, that s not what s happening in practice. Despite Brinkema s previous ruling, immigration attorneys at Dulles International Airport in Virginia aren t allowed into the secure area to talk to visa holders. Instead, they wait until people exit into the main part of the airport.Proud to work with the great group of volunteer attorneys @DullesJustice pic.twitter.com/cet86qpHfm  Christine B (@cdbachy) February 1, 2017 When people come through the international arrivals, we line that area, and lawyers are trying to get all the information they can from people coming through arrivals, Molly Hartshorn, a volunteer with Dulles Justice Coalition, told RT. There s a great wall of attorneys asking people,  How was Customs? Did you see anything strange?  Did anything get handed out on the airplane that was strange? Did they make you sign anything? Even on Tuesday, after the ruling, lawyers were still only gaining information from arriving passengers who were allowed to enter the US, Sirine Shebaya, a volunteer lawyer, told Vox. Although returning green-card holders were being allowed in the country after extensive screening, first-time lawful permanent residents were still being turned away.A beautiful crew of folks who fed us and stood with signs to support all those coming in from customs. pic.twitter.com/dVyfatXS61  Justin Eisele (@Jteisele) February 2, 2017Customs and Border Patrol agents refused to talk to Shebaya or Azadeh Erfani, who works with the Capital Area Immigrants  Rights Coalition, according to Vox. That doesn t mean that the CBP employees agree with the executive order, however. Asylum law requires CBP officers to affirmatively ask if an applicant fears return when placing them into expedited removal, an immigration official told The Intercept. By pressuring them to simply get on a plane without going into formal removal proceedings, they are violating our obligations under the refugee convention. We are violating international law.

23019,"Potential Shift: Trump Warns Israel, ‘New Settlements May Not Help Peace in Middle East’","21st Century Wire says Incredibly, Donald Trump may have just thrown an executive head fake to Bibi Netanyahu.Back in December 2015 during the GOP primary campaign,the Israeli Lobby started getting very interested in Trump after he appeared to blame Israel for not securing a lasting peace agreement with the Palestinians. You could hear a pin drop in the debate hall when Trump opined: I have a real question as to whether or not both sides want to make it,  Trump said, before explaining that his concerns predominantly reside with  one side in particular [Israel]. Months later, and only days before the Republican Party s National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, Trump abandoned any pretence of  neutrality  on the Israel-Palestine issue, insisting that he was now firmly committed  to supporting Israeli settlement expansion in the illegal occupied territories, as well as not recognizing a Palestinian State.At the time this was music to Netanyahu s ears, and even better for the US-based Israel Lobby who spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year to buy-off US Congressmen and Senators in for for Israel to get everything it wants and desires.And then this happened this week By Abby Phillip and Karen DeYoung Washington PostThe White House on Thursday gently warned Israel that new or expanded settlements in the West Bank  may not be helpful  in achieving a Middle East peace, while insisting it has no  official position on settlement activity. A statement issued by press secretary Sean Spicer said that although the administration does not believe settlements are  an impediment to peace, the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal. The American desire for peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians has remained unchanged for 50 years,  Spicer s statement said, a reference to President Trump s insistence that a return to the Middle East negotiating table is a goal he hopes to achieve.While the statement carefully parsed it words, it marked a step away from what some Trump officials   and the president s designated new ambassador to Israel   have said in favor of settlements. Trump s first foreign call as president was to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and he has been sharply critical of former president Barack Obama, whom he characterized as weak on Israel.The apparent genesis of the statement was a story in Thursday s Jerusalem Post, which quoted an unnamed senior administration official telling Netanyahu s government to stop a spree of housing construction approved since Trump s inauguration, lest it interfere with Trump s plans to work toward a peace plan Continue this story at the Washington PostSEE ALSO: The Genealogy of Trump s U-Turn on PalestineREAD MORE ISRAEL NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Israel FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"February 2, 2017"
23020,"Dear America: Stop Supporting Terrorists in Syria, and Around the World","21st Century Wire says Since 2011 the United States government, led by President Barack Obama, has adopted an open policy of supporting an armed opposition in Syria. While certain officials have only recently admitted to arming and funding these militants, evidence shows that the support has been pouring in through both covert means and official channels from the onset of the conflict. We now know that those commonly referred to in the western media as  rebels  in Syria are comprised mainly of religious extremists and designated terrorists. Despite this revelation, the US, UK, France, along with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and others have continued to back them, and even go so far as to color them with political legitimacy   all in a grand effort to try and achieve regime change in Syria. It s not the first time either that Washington has pursued this same policy of destablization in order to overthrow a foreign government.President Donald Trump has an opportunity to reverse this backwards US policy. Will he capitalize on the opportunity to start anew, or will the US revert back to its old deep state default position? The passage of Hawaii Congresswomen Tulsi Gabbard s recently proposed piece of legislation entitled, Stop Arming Terrorists Act, would be positive move in that direction. Will President Trump champion her bill?The following is an open letter from writer Steven Sahiounie to the US Government To the Government of the United States of America:I am asking my American government to stop supporting terrorists in Syria. The US government, and media, keep calling them  moderate rebels , but they are not.  They were never moderate, and many are not rebels. By definition, a  rebel  is rebelling against their own government.  However, many of the US backed  rebels  are not Syrian, and have no family ties to Syria, and have never been a citizen of Syria. For example, how could a Chinese citizen fight in a rebellion against the American government?  By what right does a Chinese citizen have to kill and maim in order to change the US government?  It is wrong and makes no sense.I would never advocate, or support any armed attack, or rebellion against the American government. There are laws against murdering, raping, kidnapping and maiming people in USA.  The same such laws exist in Syria. How could a democracy and a world leader like USA advocate murdering, raping, kidnapping and maiming innocent Syrian people?From the out-set of violence and crimes in  Syria in  2011, the US backed  rebels  used sectarian slogans, and carries out sectarian attacks and massacres. Syria is a secular form of government, as is USA. Why would American leaders support the targeting of minorities in Syria, when the President of America is himself a minority? Why would the US government support the destruction on churches and mosques? American s value religious freedom, and equality of minorities; yet the US backed  Free Syrian Army  destroyed churches, targeted Christians, attacked Christian villages, as well as targeting Muslim minority sects with similar acts: such as Kessab, Ballouta, Mahardeh, and Maaloula among many others.The US government sent weapons, missiles, special training, equipment, food, medical supplies, communications, and satellite imagery to the Free Syrian Army from 2011 to 2016. Yet, the current exodus of evacuees from East Aleppo has not received even one loaf of bread from USA.  While the US backed FSA had many warehouses full of food and medicines they have left behind as they retreated deeper into East Aleppo. Finally, the  rebels  who agreed to vacate recently have burned all the medical supplies and food storages, which were the gifts of the American taxpayers, so as to prevent the distribution of those  supplies to the starving masses who have fled East Aleppo now.American citizens are currently very concerned about Syrian refugees coming to USA who may have had ties to terrorism.  The US backed  rebels  are exactly the type of people the American citizens should be afraid of as possible new neighbors, living in their midst as settled refugees.  They are the type of people who would chop off the head of their neighbor because his religion is not exactly the same as theirs.  They are the type of people who are willing to take money from a foreign government for the purpose of destroying their own community.  They are the type of people who do not value religious freedom, or minority rights. What would happen when the US backed  rebels , who may be settled in USA, decide to rebel against the American government? Will the US President and Congress call them  freedom fighters ? Or, perhaps America s enemies will fund and support their armed attacks on the US government and civilians?We should all be united in our plea: please stop supporting terrorism  in Syria, and around the world.Steven Sahiounie***21WIRE Special Contributor Steven Sahiounie is an American citizen born in Fresno, California.

23021,"OPEN SOCIETY: Soros-backed, Anti-Trump Immigration Protests ‘Sprung from Nowhere’ at Airports Across America","21st Century Wire says This week a US presidential executive order temporarily restricted travelers and refugees from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen from entering America. In response to the controversial order, a wave of anti-Trump  flash mob  protests emerged seemingly out of nowhere at New York s JFK Airport and other airports across the nation. Welcome to the brave new world of digital activism, driven by some of the world wealthiest men   ENGINEERING CRISIS    George Soros tied to protests over Trump s recent executive order concerning immigration.  (Photo illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)While the airport angst appeared to be an organic effort to reject Trump s executive order on immigration, it was revealed that the heavily organized protests were found to be tied to social movement billionaire financier George Soros. Participating groups included the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the National Immigration Law Center, the Urban Jusric Center, and  Make The Road  advocacy group, to name only a few   are all funded by Soros front organizations led by his Open Society Foundation.The airport protests erupted just a week after a string of multi-million dollar Soros-linked/Democratic Party-affiliated NGO s organized what was dubbed a  Women s March on Washington DC. The Soros-backed women s march  was full of Hollywood celebrities in addition to a bevy of other speakers that included Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards, activist Gloria Steinem, filmmaker Michael Moore, as well as the convicted felon Donna Hylton, who took part in kidnapping and torturing a 62-year-old real-estate broker named Thomas Vigliarole, in a botched ransom plot from 1985.The recent airport protests and mainstream media reportage regarding the immigration based executive order prompted a response from President Donald Trump over the past 24 hours:Below will take a closer look at the main outline of the immigration based executive order, as another wave of Soros-backed political opposition has been triggered into action  (Image Source: abcnews.com)Here are the key provisions of the immigration order outlined by the Trump administration:Whether or not someone supports the new US immigration order, it is strange that the list does not include other countries linked to state-sponsored terror such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Pakistan. From a security standpoint, by leaving out these terrorist-linked and terrorist sponsor countries   Trump s executive order makes little sense.In a press release from February of 2016, The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) outlined travel orders similar to Trump s immigration EO based on the Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015. Here s a passage of the DHS release discussing travel restrictions concerning the exact countries included in the Trump order: The Department of Homeland Security today announced that it is continuing its implementation of the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 with the addition of Libya, Somalia, and Yemen as three countries of concern, limiting Visa Waiver Program travel for certain individuals who have traveled to these countries. Pursuant to the Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security had sixty days to determine whether additional countries or areas of concern should be subject to the travel or dual nationality restrictions under the Act. After careful consideration, and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence and the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security has determined that Libya, Somalia, and Yemen be included as countries of concern, specifically for individuals who have traveled to these countries since March 1, 2011. At this time, the restriction on Visa Waiver Program travel will not apply to dual nationals of these three countries. DHS continues to consult with the Department of State and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to develop further criteria to determine whether other countries would be added to this list. Last month, the United States began implementing changes under the Act. The three additional countries designated today join Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Syria as countries subject to restrictions for Visa Waiver Program travel for certain individuals. Under the new law, the Secretary of Homeland Security may waive these restrictions if he determines that such a waiver is in the law enforcement or national security interests of the United States. Such waivers will be granted only on a case-by-case basis. As a general matter, categories of travelers who may be eligible for a waiver include individuals who traveled to these countries on behalf of international organizations, regional organizations, and sub-national governments on official duty; on behalf of a humanitarian NGO on official duty; or as a journalist for reporting purposes. Additionally, under the Obama administration, during the Syrian refugee resettlement program US entrance for Iraqi refugees was halted for 6 months in 2011.Interestingly, several Soros-linked organizations led the charge following the detention of immigrant travelers at airports in America over this past weekend. The ACLU, and the immigration-advocacy group Make The Road, both Soros linked entities, were heavily involved in organizing political opposition concerning the Trump immigration order.In 2014, it was disclosed that George Soros s Open Society Foundations granted $50 million dollars to the ACLU. Additionally, a law suit filed by ACLU associated lawyers and The National Immigration Law Center led to a stay of President Trump s executive orders over the past 48 hours.Breitbart recently reported that the  The National Immigration Law Center has received numerous Open Society grants earmarked for general support. RT reported the following on January 30th: Three more federal judges, along with a district judge, have issued rulings barring authorities from deporting people detained at US airports following President Donald Trump s executive order restricting entry to travelers from seven countries with Muslim-majorities. Whether in the flesh, social media or through mainstream TV, the populace is subject to various forms of hyperreal propaganda around the global   in many ways this is being used to push certain political regime changes and party objectives through the use of deceptive color revolutions and their many incarnations.In a book from 2011 written by Susanne Elizabeth Shawyer entitled  Radical Street Theatre and the Yippie Legacy: A Performance History of the Youth International Party, 1967 1968,  we gain a clearer perspective of the term  Smart Mobs   and the nature of these cross-platform gatherings: The potential for ideological uses of flash mobs soon became clear by autumn 2003. Because of its original apolitical nature and network organization, the flash mob was easily appropriated for other means beyond random fun. Flash mobs were soon used for political or commercial end by those seeking to capitalize on the trendy cultural capital of flash mobs. Adding to that, Shawyer cites author social science critic Howard Rheingold, who penned a book entitled  Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution  in 2003 and continued to outline the nature of smart mobs: A smart mob may be composed of strangers who have no relationship to each other beyond their mutual connection to the network, yet this connection creates a virtual community and provides the opportunity for collective action. When looking at the smart mob phenomena concerning the recent anti-trump protests in America, we can see how a large block of people can become useful in spreading political or cultural memes.In addition, the blending of socially engineered political agitator mobs and color revolutions is becoming more and more imperceptible as any group-think meme can cause a sudden flash gathering for the cause of the day.Controversial filmmaker Michael Moore took to social media to rouse the masses, while acknowledging that the Soros-backed NGO MoveOn.org mobilized a protest directly outside of the White House . Debra Heine PJ MediaThe flurry of anguished news stories and protests surrounding President Trump s executive action temporarily suspending  immigrants and non-immigrants  from  countries of particular concern  appears to be part of a coordinated PR effort financed by left-wing billionaire George Soros.Rather than a complete  Muslim ban  as promised during the campaign, Trump s executive order contains moderate refugee restrictions, similar to those that have been implemented by President Obama. If reports are true that restrictions are being applied even to green-card holders, that is an unfortunate misapplication of the law that will likely soon be corrected.Protesters quickly materialized Saturday at JFK Airport, where some refugees were being temporarily detained.Who are these people? Make the Road  is a NY-based far-left non-profit funded in part by George Soros.According to Breitbart s Aaron Klein, the signatories to the lawsuit filed Saturday to block Trump s executive order included immigration lawyers from groups financed by Soros.At least one case quickly prompted a legal challenge as lawyers representing two Iraqi refugees held at Kennedy International Airport in New York filed a motion early Saturday seeking to have their clients released. They also filed a motion for class certification, in an effort to represent all refugees and other immigrants who they said were being unlawfully detained at ports of entry.The suit was filed by lawyers from the International Refugee Assistance Project, the National Immigration Law Center, the Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization at Yale Law School, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and the International Refugee Assistance Project (formerly Iraqi Refugee Assistance Project) at the Urban Justice Center.The ACLU is massively funded by Soros s Open Society Foundations, including with a $50 million grant in 2014.The National Immigration Law Center has received numerous Open Society grants earmarked for general support.The Urban Justice Center is also the recipient of an Open Society grant.Taryn Higashi, executive director of the Center s International Refugee Assistance Project, which is listed on the Trump lawsuit, currently serves on the Advisory Board of the International Migration Initiative of Soros s Open Society Foundations.Reportedly, open-borders advocate Soros has provided some $76 million for immigrant issues over the past decade, as Soros-funded immigrant rights groups  helped influence President Obama s immigration policy.PJ Media continues here..READ MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"January 31, 2017"
23022,"President Trump Fires Acting Attorney General, Sally Yates","21st Century Wire says In a press release from the Office of the Press Secretary, it was revealed today that acting Attorney General, Sally Yates, was relieved of duty after instructing Department of Justice lawyers not to defend Trump s executive order on travel bans. The Press Secretary release noted that Yates  betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States.  Trump took to Twitter and launched a pointed tweet saying that  The Democrats are delaying my cabinet picks for purely political reasons. They have nothing going but to obstruct Yates will be replaced by Dana Boente, the US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to hold the position of acting attorney general. In the press release Boente is quoted as saying,  I am honored to serve President Trump in this role until Senator Sessions is confirmed. I will defend and enforce the laws of our country to ensure that our people and our nation are protected. RT reports on this breaking story below: RTYates was relieved of her post Monday, just hours after news broke that she was instructing Department of Justice lawyers not to defend the executive order..@POTUS has named Dana Boente, US Attorney for the Eastern District of VA as Acting Attorney General.  Sally Yates has been relieved.  Sean Spicer (@PressSec) January 31, 2017Yates  betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States,  a press release from the Office of the Press Secretary read.Boente, an Obama appointee, was confirmed by the Senate to his previous US Attorney post. The Trump administration told reporters Monday evening that was good enough to allow him to sign Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants authorizing surveillance of perceived foreign threats in the US.This is unprecedented, as Boente s Senate confirmation did not grant him FISA approval power. That authority is reserved to the US attorney general and deputy attorney general, who until now have been directly confirmed by the Senate to those posts. It remains to be seen if this move will face a legal challenge. I am honored to serve President Trump in this role until Senator Sessions is confirmed.

23023,Trump Executive Order on Ethics Commitments Bans Lobbying for Executive Branch Employees,"21st Century Wire says Reactions around the world are mixed with regards to the first salvo of executive orders coming out of the Trump White House, but here s one that will likely have many readers nodding in agreement  even some reluctant agreement from the left, perhaps?On January 28th, President Trump signed the Executive Order on Ethics Commitments by Executive Branch Appointees. Will this executive order have some of the DC  swamp life  scrambling to tune up the ethics associated with political appointees and lobbying on Capital Hill? Has President Trump just put some gravitas behind his campaign promises to  drain the swamp ?Time will tell, but this could be a step in the right direction in curtailing some of the power that lobbyists can wield.RT has more in the report below: RTAs part of his promise to  drain the swamp  US President Donald Trump has signed an  ethics commitments  executive order restricting his administration officials from working as lobbyists after they leave government.The order bans his appointees from lobbying any government official for two years and the agency they worked in for five years. It also prevents them from ever lobbying the US on behalf of a foreign government or foreign political parties.The order is  solely enforceable by the United States by any legally available means.  Anyone found violating the ban could be barred from lobbying their former agency for up to another five years, on top of the five-year period covered by the order.The order also states that Trump, or his designee, may also grant  to any person a waiver of any of restrictions contained in the pledge. A huge focus of Trump s election campaign was his promise to tackle Washington insiders.  His pledge to  drain the swamp  became a hugely popular chant at his rallies. The executive order is an effort to deliver on those promises however it s far from certain that it will be effective.It s already common for former officials to find ways to use their influence without registering as lobbyists. Under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, former officials can avoid registering as lobbyists if they spend less than 20 percent of their time in meetings with government officials Continue this report at RTREAD MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"January 31, 2017"
23024,Trump Supporters Attacked By Liberal Protesters: Taking Political Violence to New Level,"21st Century Wire says  Trump protests are getting out of hand, yet again. This time in Portland Oregon. Liberal progressive protesters have taken to the streets in opposition to the President s latest controversial executive order instituting a 7 nation travel ban. Lets see how it turned out:Protesters surrounded Trump supporters outside the Portland airport and bullhorned in their faces bumper sticker slogans like,  No Fear, No Hate!  and then  Peaceful Protest!  Anyone who s not seen the full video at this point might still think this was a protest and not a violent mob bordering on a riot.The extreme left protestors chased the Trump supporters into the Portland airport and things got ugly. One of the Trump supporters was sucker punched, which seems to be an escalation of violence among protesters, similar to the recent sucker punch of Alt-Right leader, Richard Spenser in Washington DC last week.As the man who was assaulted hit the ground the protestors gathered around him and proceeded to continue to taunt, chant and ridicule the injured Trump supporter. Phrases like,  That s how you talk to a Nazi! That s right!  were said by anti-Trump activists,  Your boy got knocked out!  and  Wooo! Hunt the Nazis! The victim of the assault, Grant Chisholm, 39 year old from Portland says that he was hit three times in the head with something metallic in the assault. They almost killed me tonight,  said Chisholm.Chisholm claims he dropped in and out of consciousness while other protesters attempted to kick him, according to a report at  Oregonlive.com, although this is not verifiable in the video footage.The extreme left has always claimed to be the  tolerant  and  accepting  of political identities, but look how they behave when they lose the election. Is this tolerance, acceptance of different views when their protests consist of violence, cowardly sucker punch assaults and hateful chants accusing anyone with a remotely conservative world view of being a Nazi?Watch the assault happen in the video below:.

23027,Is The Washington Post Waging a ‘Media War’ on President Trump?,"21st Century Wire says The leftist media machine and the Washington Post are going after President Trump again. Are Josh Rogin and the The Post waging a media war against President Trump?Trump said last Wednesday that he,  will absolutely do safe zones in Syria  for refugees fleeing violence. A statement certainly indicating that he supports humanitarian efforts to set up refugee camps for displaced Syrians. Amid concerns that this might mean an increased US/NATO military presence in the zone the The Post and mainstream media has taken the opportunity to take the comment and paint it as a military escalation before any details of said plan have been released. One must wonder, where was The Post s warning of escalation of violence and criticism of the Obama administration when the so-called  Rebel Fighters  where being funded, armed and trained by the Pentagon, CIA and US State Department? Lindsay Graham and John McCain pushed these policies very openly and were only criticized by independent journalists.In another example of The Post going after Trump with a broad smattering of deception, Josh Rogin released an article and report titled:  The State Department s entire senior administrative team just resigned  this week. That headline went viral among consumers of leftist media outlets and has made its way into the apparent media war against Trump talking points of the week.Conversely, Allegra Kirkland of Reuters reported, at the same time, that the  Entire State Department Management Team Fired By Trump Admin. How do we reconcile these polar opposite narrative reports from the right and left sides of mainstream media?Is that an accurate headline by Rogin? Did the  entire senior administrative team resign? Is Kirkland s headline accurate? Did Trump fire the entire State Department management team?The short answer to these questions appears to be, no.At most, eight employees left the State Department. Furthermore, it appears to be an outright falsehood to claim that any of them left in protest of a Trump presidency or that there is a mass exodus of crucial members of the State Department. It also seems that it is yet another falsehood to claim that they were fired by Trump s administration.Do these claims show an intentional misleading of the readers by both the right and leftist media giants, a gross misunderstanding of the transition process at the State Department or both?The Ron Paul Institute re-posted an analysis on this situation from WeMeantWell.com that is brings more facts to light. Compare what you read below with Josh Rogin s talking points for an interesting view into how the mainstream leftist media is spinning stories about the Trump administration.The Ron Paul Institute & WeMeantWell.com bring some perspective to the topic below: Ron Paul InstituteYesterday at the State Department five officials resigned or retired. Another one today.The media has gone near-insane, claiming State is crumbling in protest under the Trump administration. This is not true. What happened at State is very routine.Leaving the Department are head of the Management Bureau Pat Kennedy (above), Assistant Secretary of State for Administration Joyce Anne Barr, Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs Michele Bond, Ambassador Gentry O. Smith, director of the Office of Foreign Missions, arms control official Tom Countryman, and Victoria Nuland.Here s the story:  No one at the State Dept resigned in protest.  No one was formally fired.  Six people were transferred from or retired from political appointee positions. Technically those who did not retire can be considered to have  resigned,  but that is a routine HR/personnel term used, not some political statement. The six are career Foreign Service career personnel (FSOs) They previously left their FSO job to be appointed into political jobs and now have resigned those (or retired out of the State Department) to return to career FSO jobs. A circle. They are required to submit a letter of resignation as a matter of routine when a new president takes office.  As for perspective: only one Under Secretary of State (Alan Larson) stayed through the transition from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush. It is routine for senior officials to leave or be reassigned.  Several of the six are connected to the Clinton emails and/or Clinton s handling of Benghazi. One of these people, Pat Kennedy, played a significant role in both, as well as many other controversial issues during Clinton s term. Sources tell me that although officially Kennedy  retired,  he was more or less required to do so by the Trump administration.  I have no information on the others, whether they were asked to retire, or just part of a reshuffling of positions and will routinely be reassigned. Most likely the latter, as such reshuffling is very common as administrations change. As everywhere in the government, the new administration fills its own political appointee slots.  Some of the six will hit mandatory retirement age on January 31 anyway.  Reports that these people represent  senior management  at State confuse terms. Because of the odd way State is organized, four of the six work in the Management Bureau, M in State talk. Kennedy was the head of the Bureau. The four play varying roles and collectively are not the senior management of the State Department. Two work in other parts of the Department (Countryman and Nuland) and are more directly tied to policies likely to change under the new administration.  All six persons come from offices with a deep bench. It is highly unlikely that any of the work of the State Department will be impeded by any of these changes. Every office has a second, third, fourth, etc., person in charge who will step up pending formal replacements to be nominated and confirmed. This is all part of the standard transition process.  As an example, I worked in the Bureau of Consular Affairs for most of my 24 years at State, including working with/for Michele Bond, one of the resignees. I personally know the people in the next rank below her, and all have equal experience and tenure as Bond. There will be no gap in experience or knowledge as some press reports have fretted. There will be no void. A slightly more dire, but responsible take, here.  There will very likely be more, similar,  resignations  and reshuffling at State. New political appointees will bring in their own staff, for example. But unless and until an employee holds a press conference to announce s/he is resigning out of protest, the media should take care to calm down, verify facts, and report accurately.  The Washington Post stated these changes were part of an  ongoing mass exodus of senior Foreign Service officers who don t want to stick around for the Trump era.  I am not aware of any other noteworthy departures (two lesser officials left earlier this month in circumstances not clearly connected to Trump) and as stated above, the six did not resign in protest. Regardless, eight people in any context do not constitute a mass exodus.  The Post article is, in my opinion, grossly alarming. It reflects a reporter apparently unfamiliar with transitions Continue this report at The Ron Paul InstituteREAD MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"January 28, 2017"

23031,Trump Revives Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines,"21st Century Wire says Tuesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive action removing legal obstacles holding up the completion of the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines. This story will certainly be a hot button for a lot of people. Reactions will likely depend on one s perspective on Trump, understanding of land issues, thoughts on cultural preservation, energy, US jobs, water quality and ecological harmony.With Progressive Leftwing attacks in full overdrive, post Trump s inauguration, many people are looking to the Trump administration to either confirm their worst fears or their greatest hopes, with every move he makes. But remember, Trump s  Art of the Deal,  is in play now and things may not always be black/white or good/bad, as this administration performs their first set of actions setting the foundation for the next 4-8 years.Many following the issue are not taking into consideration that the pipeline is more than 90% complete when Obama put a hold on the completion of the DAPL via the US Army Corps of Engineers. Obama s move was hardly one of stopping development of this pipeline but was likely politically motivated.It is worth noting that they had previously approved all plans for the completion of the DAPL in June of 2016 and appears to have been put a hold on the completion in the wake of the elevated protests at the Standing Rock location and the US Presidential election.Regardless, both pipeline projects are divisive political hot potato issues   which have now fallen into the hands of Donald Trump. Expect Trump s reaction to generate renewed protests and opportunities for negative press.RT explores the topic further in the report below:RTPresident Donald Trump ordered the removal of obstacles to the construction of two major oil and gas pipelines, which the Obama administration had reluctantly blocked after protests from environmentalists and Native Americans.The construction will be  subject to terms and conditions to be negotiated by us,  Trump said, citing as an example the need for pipe components to be built in the US.Other presidential actions signed on Tuesday included expediting environmental reviews for critical infrastructure projects and streamlining the  extremely cumbersome  regulatory process for domestic manufacturing. The regulatory process in this country has become a tangled-up mess,  Trump said.Tuesday s actions weren t technically executive orders but presidential memoranda, an executive action ranked just below but with equal force. Unlike an executive order, a presidential memorandum does not have to be numbered, include a cost estimate, or cite the authority under which it is issued.White House spokesman Sean Spicer reminded reporters on Tuesday that the Dakota Access Pipeline is 93 percent complete. Trump intends to sit down with all the parties involved with the pipeline, including Native Americans, and negotiate the best deal that benefits everyone, Spicer said.The new administration wanted to start on the Keystone XL approval process as soon as possible, Spicer said.TrumpDAPLReactions Trump s decision was quickly condemned by environmentalists, Native American activists, the American Civil Liberties Union and a number of Democratic lawmakers. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) said the US  can t afford to build new pipelines that lock us into burning more fossil fuels  and vowed to do everything to stop both pipelines.A lawyer for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe said the decision was made  hastily and irresponsibly.  The tribe said it intended to pursue legal action against Trump s order, adding that the pipeline posed a risk not just for their water supply but also for millions of Americans living downstream.One of the leading organizations in the Standing Rock protests, the Indigenous Environmental Network, called Trump s actions  insane and extreme, and nothing short of attacks on our ancestral homelands. Trump is portraying his true self by joining forces with the darkness of the Black Snake pipelines crossing across the culturally and environmentally rich landscape of the prairie lands of America,  the IEN said in a statement.The North Dakota Petroleum Council, representing the state s oil producers, hailed the presidential action as  a great step forward for energy security in America,  the organization s president Ron Ness told Reuters.Keystone XL is a shortcut proposed for the existing system that carries oil and gas from Alberta s shale fields in Canada to Steele City, Nebraska. The segment would have run through Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska. Despite being initially in favor of the pipeline, the Obama administration rejected it in November 2015, citing its  overinflated role in [US] political discourse. Obama likewise blocked the final stretch of the Dakota Access (DAPL) pipeline in December, after US military veterans joined Native Americans protesting the construction under Lake Oahe, the principal water source for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota. Most of the 1,172-mile-long pipeline from North Dakota s Bakken shale fields to Illinois has already been completed.Asked about #DakotaAccessPipeline & #Keystone, Spicer says #Trump's focus is jobs, the economy & using US resources https://t.co/m96ivKU6bR pic.twitter.com/10MSqpx5YL  RT America (@RT_America) January 23, 2017Both Trump and his nominee for Energy Secretary Rick Perry held shares in Energy Transfer Partners, the company building DAPL, but have since divested of them, according to their attorneys.Following media reports that Trump would revive the pipeline projects, shares of TransCanada, Energy Transfer Partners LP and Energy Transfer Equity LP went up 1.1 percent, 3.3 percent and 1.7 percent respectively, Bloomberg noted.Continue this report at RTREAD MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"January 25, 2017"
23032,Tucker Carlson to Border Angels Founder: Why Shouldn’t Borders Be Protected?,"21st Century Wire says Why shouldn t borders be protected?  It is a fair question Tucker is asking Enrique Morones, founder of  Border Angels  (pro-immigration advocate group) in a recent discussion about President Trump s 10 point immigration plan.Morones was quick to call Trump s position on illegal immigration  racist  and  xenophobic  yet seemed to have no knowledge that the policies of Mexico are much more harsh with regard to illegal immigration. In Mexico illegal immigration is a felony, illegal immigrants can face deportations (based even on financial viability, physical and mental health) and up to 10 years in prison for repeat offenders. Tucker also points out that Mexico only allows 4% of their applicants clemency whereas the US grants 49% and Morones again seems completely unaware of the facts being presented.Certainly it is a sensitive topic that should be open for debate by all citizens but the critical thinkers out there are likely wondering  Are Morones and many of those on the left confusing the difference between enforcing legal US immigration policies and acts of hatred? Why does he not hold Mexico to the same standard as the US?

23033,Trump: The First President to Turn Postmodernism Against Itself,"Liberals still don t get it. Trump is the political Anti-Hero for the post pc era. Original painting artwork courtesy of Jason Liosatos.David Ernst The FederalistIf politics flows downwards from culture, then it was only a matter of time before a politician mastered the role. Love him or hate him, Donald Trump cracked that code.Tony Soprano, Walter White, and Frank Underwood are just a few recent examples of the enormously popular characters who have, each in their own way, stood in for the role of the complicated bad guy who fascinates millions of Americans.Antiheroes have long found homes in Westerns, gangster movies, and crime dramas, such as Al Pacino s portrayal of Miami drug kingpin Tony Montana in  Scarface.  Tony begins an epic decline and fall in the film with a nasty fight with his wife at an exclusive Miami country club. She publically humiliates him in front of a bunch of dumbstruck, WASPy, black-tie wearing, golf-playing white hairs by loudly accusing him of being a murderer, a drug dealer, and incapable of being a decent father.If Tony were a classic hero, this would have been the beginning of his moral reckoning and his search for repentance. But this is  Scarface,  and Tony is no hero, so he responds to his public exposure as a criminal in polite society by turning the mirror back on his audience and dressing them down: What you lookin  at? You all a bunch of f in  a holes. You know why? You don t have the guts to be what you wanna be. You need people like me. You need people like me so you can point your f in  fingers and say,  That s the bad guy.  So  what that make you? Good? You re not good. You just know how to hide, how to lie. Me, I don t have that problem. Me, I always tell the truth. Even when I lie. So say good night to the bad guy! Come on. The last time you gonna see a bad guy like this again, let me tell you.  Al Pacino plays Tony Montana in Scarface.A criminal s longing to be accepted by rich people who aren t criminals themselves isn t a new theme. Nevertheless, considering that Oliver Stone wrote the screenplay, Tony s rant is likely commentary about the hypocrisy of supposedly  respectable  people in cutthroat, capitalistic, Reagan-era America who are substantively no different than Tony is. All these well-to-do Miami types wouldn t be caught dead associating with someone like Tony, even though they know full well that the cocaine business is making them all rich, and many of them probably abuse his product.Thus, from Tony s perspective, what s the point of being decent when the people who supposedly model  decency  have none of it themselves? Wouldn t a sign of moral contrition to these people be a perverted mockery of moral contrition? Wouldn t it be degrading even for Tony?Tony isn t a hero or a villain: he s an antihero. You probably won t admit to rooting for him, but if you enjoyed watching him stick it to those (presumably) stuck-up hypocrites, then it s likely that you did. He s everything his wife said he was, sure, but at least he has the balls to be honest about it.Donald Trump, the Political AntiheroTrump replicated this scene in his inaugural address Friday, a  declaration of war  against  the establishment  whose  victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. And while they celebrated in our nation s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. He acted similarly in a jaw-dropping performance at the Al Smith Dinner just days before his election. With every hiss-inducing joke at Hillary Clinton s expense was an unsubtle middle finger to everyone else in attendance. Consider his opening remarks: And a special hello to all of you in this room who have known and loved me for many, many years. It s true. The politicians. They ve had me to their homes. They ve introduced me to their children. I ve become their best friends in many instances. They ve asked for my endorsement and they ve always wanted my money. And even called me really a dear, dear friend. But then suddenly, decided when I ran for president as a Republican, that I ve always been a no-good, rotten, disgusting scoundrel. And they totally forgot about me. In other words: even if I have been a no-good, rotten, disgusting scoundrel, what does that make you? At least I don t pretend to be decent; you people, on the other hand, have the gall to pretend that you re any better than I am. Let s dispense with the fiction that you would have treated me with any less contempt if I had bothered to live up to any of your standards of decency in the first place, and acknowledge that they have nothing to do with decency per se, and everything to do with power. Your presumption of any moral superiority is a willful, bald-faced lie, and I m going to keep calling you on that crap until it puts me in the White House.Many have argued that Trump is the product of political correctness (PC). This is true only in part. Rather, both PC and Trump s response to it are fruits of the postmodernism that has long ascended to the heights of our culture: the nihilism in the common presumption that all truth is relative, morality is subjective, and therefore all of our individually preferred  narratives  that give our lives meaning are equally true and worthy of validation. Tony tellingly lectures his audience,  I always tell the truth, even when I lie.  His character was a man ahead of his time.Postmodernism: Trying to Do Good Is a Waste of TimePostmodernism is the source of the emphasis that our culture puts on authenticity, and the scorn it directs towards phoniness. After all, if the only one true thing in the world is that all truth and morality are relative, then anyone who pretends otherwise is either an idiot or a fraud. Hence the contemporary appeal of the antihero, and the disappearance of the traditional hero.Heroes who stand for traditionally good things in a world where everything supposedly  good  has long been discredited are corny Dudley Do-Rights who are at best too stupid to know better. Antiheroes, by contrast, ingratiate themselves with their audiences for their gritty realism and their candor, no matter how bad they are.Frank Underwood breaks the fourth wall with his viewers and brings them along for his evil schemes; Walter White s moment of redemption is his final admission to his wife that he sells meth because he likes to, and not to do right by his family; and Tony Soprano establishes a close bond with his daughter early on when he admits to her that he s not actually a  waste management consultant.  In the postmodern world, there is no greater virtue then authenticity, and there is no greater vice then phoniness.Postmodernism is also the source of the assumptions underlying the glib jokes of late-night comedians who exhibit disdainful prejudice towards patriotism or religion, but show bitter judgment towards any form of perceived prejudice. It is the baseline for just about every plotline in funny shows about aimless, self-centered people like  Seinfeld,   It s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,  and  Archer.  It is hyper-prejudice against prejudice, or in the words of Evan Sayet,  a cult of non-discrimination. In contrast to the many religions, systems of moral thought, and other ancient traditions that have distinguished every effort to better the human condition, postmodernism presumes that all of these endeavors are the cause of human failure. It therefore operates according to just one moral imperative: discredit anything that other people presume to stand for goodness, because the belief that anything is superior to anything else inevitably results in prejudice, interpersonal strife, and inequality.Thus, the Venus de Milo has no more aesthetic value than a crucifix in a jar full of urine; Beethoven s symphonies are no more profound than the latest round of top 40 hits; all religions are fundamentally the same, and their  moderate  postmodern adherents are all comfortably represented on the  Coexist  bumper sticker. In a sense, it isn t culture at all, but rather an anti-culture that measures success insofar as it deconstructs anything that other people value.Postmodernism Merely Hides Its Hypocritical IdealismProvided that the postmodern man believes in nothing and values nothing, one wouldn t be unreasonable in concluding that he cares about nothing. But anyone who knows postmodern man also knows that nothing could be farther from the truth. Rather, the  cult of non-discrimination  is filled with bright-eyed idealism about making the world a better place, and in the cases where it challenges baseless prejudice, it does make the world a better place.

23034,Trump Moves Ahead with ‘The Wall’ Between US and Mexico," This week President Donald Trump followed through with his most audacious   building a wall along the US southern border with Mexico.After his visit to the Department of Homeland Security this afternoon, Trump is set to sign government directives today that will set in motion the construction of a new system of border reinforcement which will include a number of new provisions -including the wall.The move is expected to correspond with announcements on stricter immigration procedures in the short term   sending out a power message to illegal immigrants hoping to cross the US southern border from 2017.Bloomberg adds: The Trump administration is also considering a 120-day suspension of refugee admissions and cutting the total number allowed into the U.S. in the current fiscal year from 110,000 to 50,000, actions that could be announced as soon as Thursday, according to a person familiar with the plan. The border directives come immediately on the heals of Trump s recent statements and executive move to renegotiate, or cancel Washington s position in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the TransPacific Partnership (TPP).Once again, Trump is wasting no time putting his signature campaign issues into play   something many of his critics have doubted he would be doing.READ MORE MEXICO NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Mexico FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"January 25, 2017"
23035,Cheerleading Assassination: Are Hollywood and Politicians Going Too Far?,"21st Century Wire says Everyone has the right to air their perceived grievances about anything, including President Trump, that is one of the benefits of living in America. But there is a point where expressing grievances or protesting against policies or politicians can shift from legal protest, assembly and expression of free speech to inciting or promoting violence. We ve seen some interesting cases of public figures coming close to and maybe crossing that line during the last week.Some Hollywood celebrities, entertainers and politicians may have taken the concept of free speech a little too far when trying to express their disdain for President Trump. Celebrities Madonna and Ashley Judd lashed out with bizarre tirades during the  Women s March  in the wake of the Trump inaugural festivities.The antics of the celebs at the DC  Women s March  was a hot topic of discussion on Sunday Wire Ep #170 with Patrick Henningsen and Hesher in the final segment of the show.Madonna went as far as to say she d thought about  blowing up the White House  which she now claims was said in metaphor only, but still got her a lot of negative attention from the media, from Trump supporters and even caught the attention of the Secret Service.What Madonna and those cheering her on actually want and what they are planning to do to achieve it is as clear as mud after this protest. If the  Revolution  she speaks of is metaphorical only, then what are the goals of her and the rest of the protesters when she speaks of revolution? Chants of,  We Chose Love!  after statements, hypothetical or metaphorical, about  revolution  and  blowing up the White House  send a very confused message.Madonna claims that her comments about the White House were taken out of context, listen to the full recording and you be the judge.Warning Madonna s speech may not be appropriate for the work place or around young children due to profanity.The singer later claimed, on her Instagram page, that she is a nonviolent person and that she was not promoting violence when she said a  revolution  was starting after  good did not win this election. Yesterday s Rally. was an amazing and beautiful experience. I came and performed Express Yourself and thats exactly what i did. However I want to clarify some very important things. I am not a violent person, I do not promote violence and it s important people hear and understand my speech in it s entirety rather than one phrase taken wildly out of context. My speech began with   I want to start a revolution of love.    I then go on to take this opportunity to encourage women and all marginalized people to not fall into despair but rather to come together and use it as a starting point for unity and to create positive change in the world. I spoke in metaphor and I shared two ways of looking at things   one was to be hopeful, and one was to feel anger and outrage, which I have personally felt. However, I know that acting out of anger doesn t solve anything. And the only way to change things for the better is to do it with love. It was truly an honor to be part of an audience chanting  we choose love .   #revoltutionoflove #revolutionoflove *******************************************************A photo posted by Madonna (@madonna) on Jan 22, 2017 at 10:49am PSTKatie Rich of Saturday Night Live was suspended for what even she herself now concedes was an insensitive tweet about Barron Trump, 10 year old son of Donald Trump. Jumping on the bandwagon of ridiculing all things Trump, Rich tweeted out that,  Barron will be this contry s first homeschool shooter. Rich was suspended indefinitely by SNL after the tweet and her Twitter account was later deactivated after she tweeted an apology. Her name did not appear in the credits for the next broadcast of SNL on Saturday.Could it be that people are actually being held responsible for their over-reach on social media and on their self perceived Hollywood soap boxes? Certainly not in all cases, but the Katie Rich case is a great example of how one can ruin a career with a single mean spirited, politically fueled Tweet aimed at a ten year old.As we turn to a political example, we find a Swedish politician who s stepped down from his position after a Facebook post where he asked if  someone could shoot him  when talking about Donald Trump.Municipal council member, Roland Peterson, went too far on his criticism of Donald Trump and provoked an angry response from his fellow party and council members.More on this phenomenon from RT  RTA municipal council member of a Swedish town called Kalmar has resigned due to a Facebook post he made asking if someone could  shoot  America s new president, Donald Trump. I believed that Donald Trump would calm down after he became the president [of the US]. But how wrong I was! He exceeded my worst fears! Could anyone shoot him?  Swedish Social Democratic Party member Roland Peterson, a municipal official in Kalmar s Soedermoere district, wrote on his Facebook page on Sunday, though he removed it an hour later.Nonetheless, Peterson decided to step down as member of both his party and the Soedermoere Municipal Council and Planning Board after making the post, announcing his resignation on Monday morning. After my blunder on Facebook, there is a risk that I will become a burden for the Social Democrats in Kalmar. I do not want it, so I chose to leave all my posts,  Peterson wrote in a letter to his party members, as cited by the local Oestra Smaland newspaper.Person s post provoked an angry reaction from his party members and fellow councilors. It is good that he [Peterson] removed it [the post],  councilor Johan Persson told Oestra Smalan, adding that people should  never call for violence  regardless of their opinion of Donald Trump or other issues.The Social Democrats  leader in Kalmar, Roger Holmberg, denounced the post as  inappropriate  and  idiotic,  while stressing that  even thinking about the idea of violence is completely wrong.  He told Swedish broadcaster STV that he had had a conversation with Peterson and said that new party members would receive training in working with social media.Holmber said that Peterson  is deeply remorseful,  explaining that he  did not understand the impact of the post in the social media. Peterson told STV that he  would have never written  the post if he had considered the consequences, while promising he  will never do it again.  He also explained to Oestra Smalan that it was Trump s environmental policy that had deeply upset him. He [Trump] risks the future of the entire Earth,  he said, adding that  now, when the world has started going in the right direction,  Trump plans to increase oil and coal production.Trump s ideas about the environmental are a source of controversy in the US. Social media went into meltdown after Trump s inauguration when certain hot topic issues disappeared from the White House website, including climate change.Many mainstream media outlets initially reported on the conspicuous disappearances, but are adopting a more cautious  wait-and-see  approach for the time being.Anti-Trump angst was running high both in the US and abroad after his inauguration. On Saturday, Donald Trump s first full day in the White House, thousands of women marched through US cities to protest Trump and call for the protection of civil liberties and diverse cultures Continue this report at RTRead More Election News at: 21st Century Wire Election CoverageSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER@ 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"January 24, 2017"
23036,POLITICAL AGITATOR: Globalist George Soros Linked to Over 50 ‘Partners’ of the Women’s March on Washington,"21st Century Wire says More than 50 NGO  partners  of the Women s March on Washington were found to be tied to social movement financier George Soros. While the DC gathering was billed as a grassroots movement for women s rights in America, it was anything but as a string of multi-million dollar Democratic Party-affiliated NGO s organized what was clearly an anti-Donald Trump event following the US presidential inauguration this past week.  DIVIDE BY DESIGN    (Photo illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)As we ve stated before here at 21WIRE, this kind of political protest is designed to first cause public disruption, while also fomenting a form of socially-engineered cultural, gender and class warfare.In the case of the Women s March on Washington, a militant style of identity politics was on a full frontal display. Enter stage left   the celebrities This was never more apparent than the hate filled diatribe of Hollywood actress Ashley Judd, whose angry rhetoric was eclipsed only by famed singer Madonna, who during her obscenity laced speech admitted to harboring violent thoughts directed at the White House. Consequently, the Material Girl is now reportedly under Secret Service investigation for her bomb related threat this past Saturday.Watch how both Judd and Madonna are driven by rage during their politically divisive speeches at the Women s March on Washington https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-5ZkrQHyNcDuring an interview with ABC NEWS, Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway  didn t see the point,  of the Women s March. Additionally, Conway underscored that 29-30 million women across America voted for Trump and their voices were heard in the 2016 election https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVEiGcT9wD4QUESTION: Was the heavily organized Women s March on Washington just another example of a radical globalist and cultural Marxist  progressive  agenda at play?Historically speaking, many social movements have worked to erode the legitimacy of a democratically elected government through a series of artificial  color  upheavals (color revolutions), and where possible   weakening a country s national sovereignty through forced dependency on multilateral globalist institutions like the UN or IMF, while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the public s political perspective.This is how the US and its CIA conduct their destablization  color revolution  campaigns overseas, and now astute observers will recognize these exact same methods being deployed here inside the US.Overseas, Washington tends to use the same cast of NGO fronts to build-up pro-US political opposition groups, as well as plan and generate civil unrest. They include the Albert Einstein Institute (AEI), National Endowment for Democracy (NED), International Republican Institute (IRI), National Democratic Institute (NDI), Freedom House and later the International Center for Non-Violent Conflict (ICNC), and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the financial and contractor arm of the Department of State.Inside the US, deep state actors in Washington generally work through Democratic Party affiliated organizations like MoveOn.org, as well as through labor union organizations like AFL-CIO, and UNITE HERE. These, along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this latest protest movement in America.While it still remains to be seen if Trump s stated political vision for America can unite an embattled nation, one thing is clear   many NGO groups operating inside the US will continue their organized opposition to the newly elected president over the course of his time in the White House.  BITTER PILL    Madonna s waning singing career gives way to cultural upheaval and demagoguery. (Image Source: Extra.ie)Other  partners  for the march included the American Atheists and UniteWomen.org, who ran a public relations campaign which featured videos with the hashtags #ImWithHer, #DemsInPhily and #ThanksObama. Once again, all road lead back to billionaire Hillary Clinton financier, George Soros and his Open Society NGO empire.Writer Asra Nomani expands on the Soros web here: By my draft research, which I m opening up for crowd-sourcing on GoogleDocs, Soros has funded, or has close relationships with, at least 56 of the march s  partners,  including  key partners  Planned Parenthood, which opposes Trump s anti-abortion policy, and the National Resource Defense Council, which opposes Trump s environmental policies. The other Soros ties with  Women s March  organizations include the partisan MoveOn.org (which was fiercely pro-Clinton), the National Action Network (which has a former executive director lauded by Obama senior advisor Valerie Jarrett as  a leader of tomorrow  as a march co-chair and another official as  the head of logistics ). Other Soros grantees who are  partners  in the march are the American Civil Liberties Union, Center for Constitutional Rights, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. March organizers and the organizations identified here haven t yet returned queries for comment. NOTE: See her full story below.The Free Thought Project illustrates the contrived socially engineered nature behind the Women s March on Washington in lengthy passage below:Washington, D.C.   An investigation by a New York Times affiliate has revealed that billionaire globalist financier George Soros, who recently called Donald Trump a  would-be dictator  during an interview at Davos, and whose Open Society Foundation works to finance and forward progressive causes across the world, and is intimately connected to numerous color revolutions, the Arab Spring, and various other political uprisings across the globe, has been revealed to be connected to more than 50 of the groups that organized the nationwide  Women s Marches  that saw millions of Americans take to the streets across the country.The march s official website says,  We stand together, recognizing that defending the most marginalized among us is defending all of us.  Many people turned out to be a manifestation of that ideal, but it s important to understand the reality of what is happening on a strategic political level as an inorganic politically contrived and funded event. This, in no way, takes away from the validity of standing up for women s issues but is important to note that women are being used as pawns in a larger ideological political game that has international overtones of power politics.These marches were largely billed as  spontaneous  and  grassroots  actions, by publications like The Guardian and Vox. However, the reality exposed by an investigation by self-described liberal feminist Asra Q. Nomani, writing for New York Times affiliate Women in the World, revealed that after studying the  funding, politics and talking points of the some 403 groups that are  partners  of the march, contrary to the non-partisan rhetoric used in these marches, they were not really  women s march  but were rather  for women who are anti-Trump. Nomani reveals that the  Women s Marches  were actually organized as political tools to be used to strategically forward a progressive political agenda against President Donald Trump   exposing the protests to largely be an organized, top-down driven political operation   and not an organic movement of concerned Americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media.

(Image Source: thefederalist.com). Asra Q. Nomani NY Times   Women in the WorldIn the pre-dawn darkness of today s presidential inauguration day, I faced a choice, as a lifelong liberal feminist who voted for Donald Trump for president: lace up my pink Nike sneakers to step forward and take the DC Metro into the nation s capital for the inauguration of America s new president, or wait and go tomorrow to the after-party, dubbed the  Women s March on Washington ? The Guardian has touted the  Women s March on Washington  as a  spontaneous  action for women s rights. Another liberal media outlet, Vox, talks about the  huge, spontaneous groundswell  behind the march. On its website, organizers of the march are promoting their work as a grassroots effort with  independent  organizers. Even my local yoga studio, Beloved Yoga, is renting a bus and offering seats for $35. The march s manifesto says magnificently,  The Rise of the Woman = The Rise of the Nation. It s an idea that I, a liberal feminist, would embrace. But I know   and most of America knows   that the organizers of the march haven t put into their manifesto: the march really isn t a  women s march.  It s a march for women who are anti-Trump. As someone who voted for Trump, I don t feel welcome, nor do many other women who reject the liberal identity-politics that is the core underpinnings of the march, so far, making white women feel unwelcome, nixing women who oppose abortion and hijacking the agenda. To understand the march better, I stayed up through the nights this week, studying the funding, politics and talking points of the some 403 groups that are  partners  of the march.

Conway, like many viewers, immediately caught Todd in the fact that the topic was meaningless and was quick to point out a number of main stream media reports containing  falsehoods  that were pushed by establishment media. Conway hit her stride regarding the topic of inauguration attendance numbers when she told Chuck Todd,  Presidents aren t judged by crowd sizes at their inaugurations, they are judged by their accomplishments. When Todd hit back with a double down on the accusations that the comments by Trump Press Secretary, Sean Spicer, were put out there to push a  provable falsehood  Conway fired back with some choice phrases that have commentators on the edge of their seats.

23041,U.S. Inauguration: Historic Day Marks Beginning of Renewed ‘America First’ Era," Mark Anderson  American Free PressWASHINGTON, D.C. Donald John Trump took to the podium on the Capitol Building s west side with a look described by Connecticut resident Ann Marie Murray as one of  humility just before Trump was sworn in Friday as the 45th president of the United States by Chief Justice John Roberts.The event clearly was seen as inspiring by many. Chicago resident Doug Sparkman, moments after Trump s inaugural address, agreed that he found Trump s remarks to be rather  Jeffersonian,  in the sense of being people-based. In that vein, he yearns for a country run on the basis of principle, not party. And given what he heard in Trump s address, he feels that s possible under the new administration. Action, and putting politics aside, is what we really need for this country,  Sparkman added.With the whole inaugural ceremony some 20 minutes behind schedule, Trump and his family, looking regal and acting highly anticipatory of the challenges that await them, arrived at the Capitol around 11:15 a.m. The new first lady, Melania, was escorted to the west balcony to be seated first, wearing a stunning high-necked blue outfit that brought  oohs  from many in the massive crowd whose view was aided by large screens on both ends of the Capitol.Trump himself, appearing reflective and solemn, emerged alongside Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and was seated at 11:32. As the somewhat chilly day spat a little rain here and there, you could feel the heavy anticipation to hear Trump take the oath of office. And soon after former Indiana Gov. Mike Pence was sworn in as vice president by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, Trump proceeded to begin taking his oath when a group of six agitators erupted in a flurry of slogans and declarations precisely when Trump began repeating the words  I do solemnly swear . . . This writer, some 10 feet from the protestors in the Section eight seating area reasonably close to the presidential podium, could see the anguish on the faces of many of the nearby inaugural attendees, a number of whom traveled long distances to hear their new president take the oath. But from their vantage point, Trump s exchange with Roberts was largely drowned out.

Keep an eye on this developing story. Alexander Mercouris The DuranDonald Trump has lashed out at Christopher Steele, the former British MI6 officer who compiled the Trump Dossier.Steele worked in Russia for MI6 in the 1990s and at one time headed MI6 s Russian desk.  It turns out that he was also the case officer of Andrey Litvinenko, the FSB defector the British authorities accuse the Russians of murdering with polonium.  It seems that Steele has however not actually travelled to Russia for twenty years, making it unclear how he contacted the various Russian insiders who he says provided him with the information he used to compile the Trump Dossier.In any event, Trump in a tweet has now called Steele a  failed spy It now turns out that the phony allegations against me were put together by my political opponents and a failed spy afraid of being sued . . . Totally made up facts by sleazebag political operatives, both Democrats and Republicans   FAKE NEWS!The reference to Steele being  a failed spy afraid of being sued  suggests that Trump is considering bringing a libel action against him.

23046,Dubious Reports of Advertisements Seeking Trump Protesters: “Get Paid Fighting Against Trump”,"21st Century Wire says Earlier this week the media lit up with reports of a political activist group that was advertising across the nation to pay protesters to come out and demonstrate against the inauguration of Donald Trump.It would come as no surprise to 21WIRE if there were cases of protestors being rallied and potentially compensated by George Soros related foundations. It would easily fall under the heading of  professional activists  and it is very real.

23047,Rosie O’Donnell Thinks Martial Law is in Order to Prevent a Trump Presidency,"21st Century Wire says Arguably irrelevant Hollywood personality, Rosie O Donnell has taken to social media to support the concept of the US Government imposing Martial Law on the nation to avoid a Trump presidency. The Hollywood personality, who by all accounts of her own should be in Canada by now, seems to have very little understanding of not only politics, but of the law as well. She, in caps-lock Tweet shouting, said that the inauguration should be delayed under martial law until Trump is  cleared of all charges.  Obviously she s referring to the  dossier  that was discredited as a fake within hours of its release by BuzzFeed and subsequent republication by many left leaning mainstream media outlets.  Charges  implies a legal case yet there was no legal case, no victim, no crime, nothing of substance at all because it was a fake document.Have a look at her whacky, ill fated attempts at affecting the political dialog on her social media output.I FULLY SUPPORT IMPOSING MARTIAL LAW   DELAYING THE INAUGURATION   UNTIL TRUMP IS ""CLEARED"" OF ALL CHARGES https://t.co/fUn8FZ8RTj  ROSIE (@Rosie) January 12, 2017As though the high horsed Hollywood liberal echo chamber didn t get enough with the caps-locked illogical rant above, she followed with yet another cry to interrupt a legitimately elected US political official with a military take over and suspension of constitutional rights.delay the day   do not swear him in until it is investigated   for the love of god america   we must stop the inaugruation @frankielucy  ROSIE (@Rosie) January 12, 2017As the final days of the Obama administration tick away we continue to bear witness to many Hollywood celebs throwing tantrums and wearing their ignorance of political realities on their sleeves (and social media feeds.)

23049,Obama Commuted Manning’s Sentence,"21st Century Wire says In yet another interesting end of term move, Obama has commuted Bradley/Chelsea Manning s sentence. He is now scheduled to be released in May of 2017 rather than 2045. Is this a power play against Trump? A potential  call of bluff  to Julian Assange, who s said he would turn himself over to the US courts if Obama frees Manning?Adam Garrie of The Duran brings some interesting analysis to the table in the article below. Adam Garrie The DuranWith less than three days left until he leaves office, Barack Obama has commuted Bradley/Chelsea Manning s sentence. Manning was to be released in 2045 but will now be released in May of this year.This surprise move is not the morally courageous move that it may appear to be. Obama, content to leave office sans dignity is clearly making a challenge to Julian Assange who recently challenged Obama to pardon Manning in return for Assange voluntarily traveling to the US to face what some would call justice, but anyone would a brain would call a show trial.Although I am personally happy that Manning will be released early (why the delay though), my sincere advice to Julian Assange is to do the following:With Donald Trump in power it may be possible to strike some sort of bargain whereby Assange can receive safe passage to Ecuador or any other country willing and able to grant him unconditional asylum. This would have to be guaranteed by President Trump.If Assange fights this battle from within the United States, elements of the deep state or worse yet, rogue agents working on behalf of the deep state or anti-Assange political interests, could take matters into their own hands.In another kick of the political football, Obama has now put yet another problem on Donald Trump s White House doorstep what to do if Assange makes good on his promise?The best thing that could possibly happen is for Assange to negotiate safe-passage out of Britain, brokered by a Trump administration. If anyone thinks the absurd charges in Sweden could impact this, they do not realise who has pulled the strings all along in this matter.If my suggestion is brought on board, Trump can tell his pro-Assange grassroots supporters (think Ron Paul followers and Infowars listeners) that he did the right thing regarding Assange. At the same time, he will be able to tell his deep state and Congressional opponents that he acted pragmatically rather than ethically in order to  move on  from the  Assange problem  instead of dragging out in a kangaroo court. Absurd though it is, some American politicians would sooner praise a pragmatic decision vis- -vis an ethical one.In any case, Manning won t be free until May of this year and a lot can happen Continue this report at The DuranREAD MORE US NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire US NewsSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER@ 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"January 17, 2017"
23050,"Henningsen: ‘Trump Challenging Sacred Cows of US Foreign Policy, But for How Long?’","21st Century Wire says Just days before the US inauguration, in his recent interview with the Times of London President-Elect Donald Trump continues to challenge a number of Washington foreign policy sacred cows, particularly neoconservative positions. He signalled a lifting of US sanctions against Russia in the spirit of cooperation in nuclear arms reductions and also to partner with Moscow in the fight radical Islamist Terror. Trump also laid into NATO calling it obsolete , while potentially driving a wedge between traditionally tight US-EU relations as he chastised Brussels, as well as US ally Germany and its leader Angela Merkel over her country s immigration policy.

23052,PROBLEM: Trump vs. The US Intelligence Machine,"21st Century Wire says The intelligence agencies of the US and the UK were chartered to serve the government and protect national security by gathering information, analyzing data and making recommendations to government officials. At least that is how it was sold to the public in the beginning.But what do we see now? We see intelligence agencies in both the US and the UK being used to serve as a political sledge hammer in the realms of foreign policy, media subversion, disinformation operations, regime change, assassination, domestic wiretapping, full spectrum surveillance and all things dirty in the political black bag of tricks. The report below raises some major questions that citizens of the US and UK should be asking themselves about their intelligence services.Are the CIA and MI6 protecting national security at all anymore?Why are these intelligence agencies actively involved in the creation and dispersal of false documents and reports?Is their end game to subvert the inauguration a democratically elected government official in the United States?Who is cheering on these intelligence agencies?Will Trump be victorious against the intelligence apparatus?One thing is certain: no functioning democracy can survive for long if its intelligence agencies feel they are more important than our elected officials  Consortium News Exclusive: President-elect Trump is in a nasty slugfest with U.S. intelligence agencies as they portray him as a Russian tool and he blasts their attempt to delegitimize his election, says ex-British intelligence officer Annie Machon.Annie Machon Consortium NewsThe clash between plutocratic President-elect Trump and the CIA is shaping up to be the heavyweight prize fight of the century, and Trump at least is approaching it with all the entertaining bombast of Mohammed Ali at the top of his game. Rather than following the tradition of doing dirty political deals in dark corners, more commonly known as fixing the match, Trump has come out swinging in the full glare of the media.In that corner, we have a deal-making, billionaire  man of the people  who, to European sensibilities at least, reputedly espouses some of the madder domestic obsessions and yet has seemed to offer hope to many aggrieved Americans. But it is his professed position on building a rapprochement with Russia and cooperating with Moscow to sort out the Syrian mess that caught my attention and that of many other independent commentators internationally.In the opposite corner, Trump s opponents have pushed the CIA into the ring to deliver the knock-out blow, but this has yet to land. Despite jab after jab, Trump keeps evading the blows and comes rattling back against all odds. One has to admire the guy s footwork.So who are the opponents ranged behind the CIA, yelling encouragement through the ropes? The obvious culprits include the U.S. military-industrial complex, whose corporate bottom line relies on an era of unending war. As justification for extracting billions   even trillions   of dollars from American taxpayers, there was a need for frightening villains, such as Al Qaeda and even more so, the head choppers of ISIS. However, since the Russian intervention in Syria in 2015, those villains no longer packed as scary a punch, so a more enduring villain, like Emmanuel Goldstein, the principal enemy of the state in George Orwell s 1984, was required. Russia was the obvious new choice, the old favorite from the Cold War playbook.The Western intelligence agencies have a vested interest in eternal enemies to ensure both eternal funding and eternal power, hence the CIA s entry into the fight. As former British MP and long-time peace activist George Galloway so eloquently said in a recent interview, an unholy alliance is now being formed between the  war party  in the U.S., the military-industrial-intelligence complex and those who would have previously publicly spurned such accomplices: American progressives and their traditional host, the Democratic Party.Yet, if the Democratic National Committee had not done its best to rig the primaries in favor of Hillary Clinton, then perhaps we would not be in this position. Bernie Sanders would be the President-elect.Two-Party ShamThese establishment forces have also revealed to the wider world a fact long known but largely dismissed as conspiracy theory by the corporate mainstream media, that the two-party system in both the U.S. and the U.K. is a sham. In fact, we are governed by a globalized elite, working in its own interest while ignoring ours. The Democrats, openly disgruntled by Hillary Clinton s election loss and being seen to jump into bed so quickly with the spooks and the warmongers, have laid this reality bare.In fact, respected U.S. investigative journalist Robert Parry recently wrote that an intelligence contact told him before the election that the intelligence agencies did not like either of the presidential candidates. This may go some way to explaining the FBI s intervention in the run-up to the election against Hillary Clinton, as well as the CIA s attempts to de-legitimize Trump s victory afterwards.Whether that was indeed the case, the CIA has certainly held back no punches since Trump s election. First the evidence-lite assertion that it was the Russians who hacked the DNC emails and leaked them to WikiLeaks: then the fake news about Russia hacking the voting computers; that then morphed into the Russians  hacked the election  itself; then they  hacked  into the U.S. electric grid via a Vermont utility.  All this without a shred of fact-based evidence provided, but Obama s expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats last month solidified this dubious reality in Americans  minds.All this culminated in the  dirty dossier  allegations last week about Trump, which he has rightly knocked down   it was desperately poor stuff.This last item, from a British perspective, is particularly concerning. It appears that a Washington dirt-digging company was hired by a Republican rival to Trump to unearth any potential Russian scandals during the primaries; once Trump had won the nomination this dirt-digging operation was taken over by a Democrat supporter of Hillary Clinton. The anti-Trump investigation was then sub-contracted to an alleged ex-British spy, an ex-MI6 man named Christopher Steele.The Role of MI6Much has already been written about Steele and the company, much of it contradictory as no doubt befits the life of a former spy. But it is a standard career trajectory for insiders to move on to corporate, mercenary spy companies, and this is what Steele appears to have done successfully in 2009. Of course, much is predicated on maintaining good working relations with your former employers.That is the aspect that interests me most   how close a linkage did he indeed retain with his former employers after he left MI6 in 2009 to set up his own private spy company? The answer is important because companies such has his can also be used as cut-outs for  plausible deniability  by official state spies.I m not suggesting that happened in this case, but Steele reportedly remained on good terms with MI6 and was well thought of. For a man who had not been stationed in Russia for over 20 years, it would perhaps have been natural for him to turn to old chums for useful connections.But this question is of extreme importance at a critical juncture for the U.K.; if indeed MI6 was complicit or even aware of this dirt digging, as it seems to have been, then that is a huge diplomatic problem for the government s attempts to develop a strong working relationship with the US, post-Brexit. If MI6 s sticky fingers were on this case, then the organization has done the precise opposite of its official task    to protect national security and the economic well-being of the UK. MI6 and its U.S. intelligence chums need to remember their designated and legislated roles within a democracy   to serve the government and protect national security by gathering intelligence, assessing it impartially and making recommendations on which the government of the day will choose to act or not as the case may be.The spies are not there to fake intelligence to suit the agenda of a particular regime, as happened in the run-up to the illegal Iraq War, nor are they there to endemically spy on their own populations (and the rest of the world, as we know post-Snowden) in a pointless hunt for subversive activity, which often translates into legitimate political activism and acts of individual expression).And most especially the intelligence agencies should not be trying to subvert democratically elected governments. And yet this is what the CIA and a former senior MI6 officer, along with their powerful political allies, appear to be now attempting against Trump.Chances for PeaceIf I were an American, I would be wary of many of Trump s domestic policies. As a European concerned with greater peace rather than increasing war, I can only applaud his constructive approach towards Russia and his offer to cooperate with Moscow to stanch the bloodshed in the Middle East.That, of course, may be the nub of his fight with the CIA and other vested interests who want Russia as the new bogeyman. But I would bet that Trump takes the CIA s slurs personally. After all, given the ugliness of the accusations and the lack of proof, who would not?So, this is a world championship heavy-weight fight over who gets to hold office and wield power, an area where the U.S. and U.K. intelligence agencies have considerable experience in rigging matches and knocking out opponents. Think, for instance, Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq in 1953; Chilean President Salvador Allende in 1973; Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in 2003; and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is wobbly but still standing, thanks to some good corner support from Russia Continue this story at Consortium News READ MORE ELECTIONS NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"January 17, 2017"

I think it s pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press. First of all, it s illegal. These are classified and certified meetings and reports,  Trump said during a press conference held at Trump Tower. Only, strategic leaks and clandestine subterfuge are par for the course in the swamp  Geoff Earle Daily MailPresident-elect Donald Trump, after growing suspicious that intelligence officials were leaking news about their classified briefings with him, says he conducted a sting operation to try to prove top spies were behind the leaks.Trump revealed the extraordinary scheme to try to entrap the senior spies in a furious press conference where he suggested the intelligence community had been behind salacious and totally unproven allegations against him. I think it s pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press. First of all, it s illegal. These are classified and certified meetings and reports,  Trump said during a press conference at Trump Tower   his first since getting elected.Then he revealed the details of the stealthy sting he says he conducted on the nation s senior spooks. I ll tell you what does happen. I have many meetings with intelligence. And every time I meet, people are reading about it,  Trump complained, possibly referencing reports on his classified briefings, which he has chosen not to receive daily. Somebody s leaking them out,  Trump said, after inveighing against leaks generally. So I said,  Maybe it s my office. Maybe my office.  Because I ve got a lot of people   Maybe it s them? What I did, is I said I won t tell anyone. I m going to have a meeting, and I won t tell anybody about my meeting with intelligence,  Trump continued.He even shielded one of his closest aides from word of the meeting. Nobody knew   not even Rhona, my executive assistant for years. She didn t know   I didn t tell her. Nobody knew,  Trump continued   drawing laughter from collected family members and staff.Having set the trap, Trump says the word leaked anyway. The meeting was held.

23054,More Fake News: Mainstream Media Lies About Trump ‘Evicting’ White House Press Corp,"21st Century Wire says Many mainstream news outlets have been abuzz about the headline going around saying that Trump may  evict  the press corp from accessing the White House, but when one looks deeper into what is being written in such articles it quickly becomes clear that there is nothing official stated about disallowing any press from the White House.Here s the facts: Incoming White House Press Secretary, Sean Spicer, while discussing potentially moving the press corps room from the James Brady Press Room, to the White House Conference Room   in order to add more seating for press to cover President Trump in the White House said: If the plan goes through, one of the officials said, the media will be removed from the cozy confines of the White House press room, where it has worked for several decades. Members of the press will be relocated to the White House Conference Center near Lafayette Square or to a space in the Old Executive Office Building, next door to the White House.Look to the Blaze for how this is spun into a narrative which serves the dual purpose of agitating Trump s detractors into believing that he is going to suppress the freedom of the press and at the same time serves as a rouse to cause his ardent supporters to appear as though they are rejoicing at the potential of a Trump Presidency that would support suppressing the free press. When comparing the actual quotes with the editorial it is obvious that The Blaze and other mainstream media outlets are playing a wicked game of deceit to further the attempts at demonizing the incoming President.We can now see who the real  Fake News  culprits are.Below is one of the fake news articles circulating online   this one was floated out by Glenn Beck and his dubious media organization The Blaze . The BlazePresident-elect Donald Trump s transition team is reportedly considering plans to evict the White House press corps from accessing the White House.According to a report from Esquire, which cited three sources with the transition team, Trump administration officials are  seriously considering  plans to evict the press corps from being able to access the White House, arguing that it would allow the press increased access to Trump. There has been no decision,  incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer told Esquire, adding that  there has been some discussion about how to do it. More from Esquire:If the plan goes through, one of the officials said, the media will be removed from the cozy confines of the White House press room, where it has worked for several decades. Members of the press will be relocated to the White House Conference Center near Lafayette Square or to a space in the Old Executive Office Building, next door to the White House.Spicer, in his comments to Esquire, suggested that one of the reasons the administration is looking to evict the press from the White House is because they want to offer more members of the press the ability to cover Trump and the White House.Currently, there are only 49 seats in the White House James Brady Press Briefing Room, not enough to honor the hundreds, and sometimes, thousands of requests from journalists to cover Trump, Spicer said.However, a different, unnamed source told Esquire that the administration might have a different motive. According to the source, the administration is considering the move because of how the media covered Trump during the campaign and after his election victory.Trump has repeatedly lambasted the media for their coverage of him, regularly taking to Twitter to blast a news agency or a reporter by name.

23055,REDUX 1963? The Deep State vs Donald Trump,"Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireWatching this week s Senate cabinet confirmation hearings was one of the most uncomfortable sights I have ever witnessed in politics. One self aggrandizing US Senator after another, each spouting out half-truths and speaking in innuendo and supposition   as if it were historical fact. The level of ignorance about world events was breathtaking. Key foreign policy cabinet nominees were Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State, General James Mattis for Defense Secretary, and Mike Pompeo for CIA director. All three men were grilled by a pride of chickenhawks and self-styled foreign policy experts like Senator Roger Wick (R), Marco Rubio (R), Bob Menendez (D) and of course, by Washington s twin neoconservative ventriloquists, John McCain (R) and Lindsey Graham (R).Particularly disturbing was the chicken-hawkish bullying by Marco Rubio of Tillerson, where the Florida Senator demanded that a future Secretary of State adopt the bellicose language of the war-monger when describing the Russian President. YOU MUST COMPLY: Nominee Rex Tillerson is trolled by Senator Marco Rubio.Regarding events in Syria that Rubio believes are war crimes, but of which there is zero evidence, Rubio asked,  Is Vladimir Putin a war criminal? Tillerson replied,  I would not use that term. Rubio went on to list things he s seen on the internet and CNN about Putin s  attacks on civilians  and accused the Russian leader of killing political opposition leaders and journalists.Tillerson replied saying,  I would want to have much more information before reaching a conclusion,  and he called Rubio s accusations, very serious charges.  That would be the mature answer. But Rubio wanted Tillerson to comply. I find it discouraging your inability to cite that, which I think is globally accepted,  Rubio replied.It was a disgusting display of arrogance and propaganda laundering by Rubio, like the other trolling Senators   demanding that Russia must be our enemy and we must retaliate to a  election hack which never happened. In this new environment of irrationality and avarice, if you resist, and if you choose diplomacy and base your views on facts, then you are un-American. This seems to be the current culture in Washington and the mainstream media: compliance to group think   and these Senate hearings showed just how far US officials are willing to go to enforce compliance on all major issues   complying on Israel, on Putin, and on the supremacy of the  intelligence community. One of the only voices brave enough to speak up about the sordid scene in the Senate was California Representative Dana Rohrabacher (R), who said during a recent radio interview that  warmongers  like Rubio are sabotaging potential future relations with Russia by calling Putin a  war criminal. All of this follows the other regressive trend   the crypto-fascist talking point that has been advanced in recent weeks by the likes of Wolf Blitzer and other mainstream news anchors, all of whom have insinuated that if Trump or anyone else does not swallow the entire DNI Intelligence Assessment on the  Russian Hack    then they are somehow  disrespecting the institution  of the CIA or any other so-called intelligence body, or even worse, that they are unpatriotic. Why won t the President-Elect accept the findings of the intelligence community?!  crowed CNN s Blitzer and other   practically brow-beating guests who appeared on the network. It s as if the only acceptable answer was total submission. For those who are old enough to remember, this is a repeat of the Iraq War deception in 2003. Low and behold, the same media operatives and political demons have been deployed to police a similar group-think regime in 2016. That should be a clue to anyone pay attention, that we are witnessing another scam.The following commentary may seem a bit far-fetched on the surface, but when you consider everything that has already gone down over the last 4 months in US politics, then the probability of another black swan event doesn t seem so far-flung. It s important to put this into historical context, and do a comparative analysis with John F Kennedy s Bay of Pigs defeat   a seminal event in US geopolitics and a major set-back for the Deep State at the time, and one that was blamed on JFK s inability to facilitate a CIA win in Cuba. A number of prominent historians and researchers have credited that defeat, along with Kennedy s desire to break-up the CIA as a primary motive for JFK s assassination. When you consider this against the present day back-drop of President Obama s 5 year failure of a proxy war to overthrow the Syrian government   a war which Hillary Clinton herself instituted, there are a number a striking parallels between then and now. More striking yet, is Donald Trump s public calls to  reorganise  the intelligence agencies   a move which threatens the very fabric of the contemporary Deep State which runs Washington and the Atlanticist alliance.In so many ways, Trump might be viewed as a moral enemy of the Deep State that has been allowed to reign unhindered by any real oversight, and accountable only to itself.The danger seems palatable, so much so that some establishment journalists are breaking ranks by talking openly about the  Deep State    a topic previously reserved for the fringes of political and geopolitical commentary and certainly not acceptable for debate on a mainstream broadcast TV network. The Intercept s Glenn Greenwald has recently written a piece which outlines this very scenario  where the Deep State has declared war on Donald Trump, and if Trump continues to push back against these institutions, the consequences could be dire. Greenwald focused on the recent fake  Trump-Russia dossier  which he stated was the work of the Intelligence Community. Looking at these last two weeks, it is clear that such a progression of events has been advanced already: The serious dangers posed by a Trump presidency are numerous and manifest. There is a wide array of legitimate and effective tactics for combating those threats: from bipartisan congressional coalitions and constitutional legal challenges to citizen uprisings and sustained and aggressive civil disobedience. All of those strategies have periodically proven themselves effective in times of political crisis or authoritarian overreach. But cheering for the CIA and its shadowy allies to unilaterally subvert the U.S. election and impose its own policy dictates on the elected president is both warped and self-destructive. Empowering the very entities that have produced the most shameful atrocities and systemic deceit over the last six decades is desperation of the worst kind. Demanding that evidence-free, anonymous assertions be instantly venerated as Truth   despite emanating from the very precincts designed to propagandize and lie   is an assault on journalism, democracy, and basic human rationality. And casually branding domestic adversaries who refuse to go along as traitors and disloyal foreign operatives is morally bankrupt and certain to backfire on those doing it. By demonizing Russia, and then tying Donald Trump to that country, the establishment has accomplished its mission in ruining the so-called  peaceful transition of power.  Interestingly, this bizarre phrase was really only introduced by US media operatives this past fall, and for a reason. Now we can see why.Consider what we are seeing to play-out right now   a political free-for-all, where the level of hate and irrational vitriol which has been intentionally built-up over, and is unprecedented in modern history.Based on the events we have seen over the past two months   the Democrat-organized street protests and call to abolish the Electoral College, Democrat intimidation of electors, the pseudo recount  by the Democratic Party and their willing agent Jill Stein, the evidence-free DNI Report on the alleged  Russian Hack,  and the fake  Trump-Russia Blackmail  dossier, as well as radical left-wing plans to  shut down next week s inauguration and block the transfer of power in Washington  you can be absolutely certain that the losing party will not give up and have yet to unveil some more audacious plans  designed to disrupt and possibly unseat the new 45th President of the United States, Donald J Trump.    The campaign to delegitimize this incoming President has been carefully coordinated through multiple actors; the corporate media (led by CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times, Washington Post and The Guardian), the Hillary Clinton campaign, the Democratic Party, Soros-funded NGOs like MoveOn.org, the McCain-Graham faction, and quietly helped along by the White House. Theoretically speaking, and taken into context with the previous paragraph   the level of Anti-Trump public hate is so over-the-top and intense right now that (heaven forbid) should some untimely incident, either accidental or intentional, befall the new President  then the American left and its cadre of stakeholders are certain to celebrate openly and gleefully. Such an incident would invariably be followed by the proverbial,  Oh well, he had it coming. This is a high stakes game  much bigger in fact than any one man, or political party. Everything is at stake: NATO, the military industrial complex, the CIA, and the existence and primacy of a globalist Deep State that has ruled the US and the world since WWII. In short, the World Order, as seen by those who control the transatlantic system of international geopolitics, trade and commerce.This should be viewed as a very sensitive matter. It goes without saying that such an incident and its predictable, engineered left-wing reaction  would inevitably trigger the beginnings of bona fide civil war in the United States.Will Trump be able to hang a wonderful new sign in the window at Pennsylvania Ave which reads,  Change of Management ?  Not if Congress and the Deep State prefers the old management.The following analysis by Zero Hedge, featuring a segment with Tucker Carlson and Glenn Greenwald expands on this possibility, and provides a number evidence points which mark what could be seen as a progression of events   leading to a dystopic conclusion . Zero Point NowJournalist Glenn Greenwald, who is not a fan of President-elect Trump, appeared on Tucker Carlson tonight to discuss the dangerous ongoing effort among powerful anti-Trump factions within the US Government s  Deep State, who have collaborated with members of the Democratic Party and the traditionally liberal media to inflict maximum damage on the incoming President. Recall Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer s ominous  six ways from Sunday  comment from 10 days ago.Greenwald, an accomplished litigator, journalist, and author, does a masterful job illustrating the players, motives, and potential fallout from this dangerous effort within the US Government s intelligence apparatus. Greenwald goes deep, discussing how Trump s election ruined the plan for regime change in Syria, specifically mentioning, among other things, that the deep state was waiting for Obama to leave office before executing their plan: The number one foreign policy priority of the CIA over the last four to five years has been the proxy war they re waging in Syria to remove Bashar Al Assad  and Hillary Clinton was quite critical of Obama for constraining them. She wanted to escalate that war to unleash the CIA, to impose a no-fly zone in Syria to confront Russia, whereas Trump took the exact opposite position. He said we have no business in Syria trying to change the government, we ought to let the Russia and Assad go free and killing ISIS and Al Qaeda and whoever else they want to kill. He [Trump] was a threat to the CIA s primary institutional priority of regime change in Syria. Beyond that, Clinton wanted a much more confrontational and belligerent posture towards Moscow, which the CIA has been acrimonious with for decades, whereas Trump wanted better relations. They viewed Trump as a threat to their institutional pre-eminence to their ability to get their agenda imposed on Washington. What you re seeing is actually quite dangerous. There really is at this point obvious open warfare between this un-elected, but very powerful faction that resides in Washington and sees Presidents come and go   on the one hand, and the person that the American democracy elected to be elected on the other. There s clearly extreme conflict and subversion taking place. This really is a must-watch, and goes hand-in-hand with Tucker s interview with Dr. Stephen Cohen this week:  .This is overt, and Schindler also just more or less outed Washington Post s David Ignatius as a CIA mouthpiece (along the same vein as Deep Throat, perhaps we can refer to Ignatius s source as Golden Shower?).READ MORE RUSSIAN HACK NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Russian Hack FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER@ 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"January 15, 2017"

23057,REVEALED: The Establishment’s Scheme to Take Down Trump,"21st Century Wire says Based on the events we have seen over the past two months   the Democrat-organized street protests and calls to abolish the Electoral College, Democrat intimidation of electors, the pseudo recount  by the Democratic Party and their willing agent Jill Stein, the evidence-free DNI Report on the alleged  Russian Hack  and the fake  Trump-Russia Blackmail  dossier, as well as radical left-wing plans to  shut down next week s inauguration and block the transfer of power in Washington  you can be absolutely certain that the losing party will not give up and have yet to unveil some more audacious plans  designed to unseat the new 45th President of the United States, Donald J Trump.    If Trump makes it past the inauguration on Jan 20th, expect a serious purge to take place in Washington DC, as the new administration attempt to remove those who are hell-bent on sabotaging the political process and transfer of power.All you need to know about this dodgy dossier   fabricated and then laundered by anti-Russian war hawk John McCain in a way which seems to be standard practice for Washington s political and media hacks alike: But this is what one would expect of a document based entirely of hearsay in which Source A claims to have gotten a juicy tidbit from Source B, who heard it from Source C deep inside the Kremlin. Constortium News Exclusive: The U.S. intelligence community s unprecedented assault on an incoming U.S. president   now including spreading salacious rumors   raises questions about how long Donald Trump can hold the White House, says Daniel Lazare  Daniel Lazare Consortium NewsIs a military coup in the works? Or are U.S. intelligence agencies laying the political groundwork for forcing Donald Trump from the presidency because they can t abide his rejection of a new cold war with Russia? Not long ago, even asking such questions would have marked one as the sort of paranoid nut who believes that lizard people run the government. But no longer.Thanks to the now-notorious 35-page dossier concerning Donald Trump s alleged sexual improprieties in a Moscow luxury hotel, it s clear that strange maneuverings are underway in Washington and that no one is quite sure how they will end.Director of National Intelligence James Clapper added to the mystery Wednesday evening by releasing a 200-word statement to the effect that he was shocked, shocked, that the dossier had found its way into the press. Such leaks, the statement said,  are extremely corrosive and damaging to our national security. Clapper added: that this document is not a US Intelligence Community product and that I do not believe the leaks came from within the IC. The IC has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions. However, part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security. Rather than vouching for the dossier s contents, in other words, all Clapper says he did was inform Trump that it was making the rounds in Washington and that he should know what it said   and that he thus couldn t have been more horrified than when Buzzfeed posted all 35 pages on its website.But it doesn t make sense. As The New York Times noted,  putting the summary in a report that went to multiple people in Congress and the executive branch made it very likely that it would be leaked  (emphasis in the original). So even if the  intelligence community  didn t leak the dossier itself, it distributed it knowing that someone else would.Then there is The Guardian, second to none in its loathing for Trump and Vladimir Putin and hence intent on giving the dossier the best possible spin. It printed a quasi-defense not of the memo itself but of the man who wrote it: Christopher Steele, an ex-MI6 officer who now heads his own private intelligence firm. A sober, cautious and meticulous professional with a formidable record  is how the Guardiandescribed him. Then it quoted an unnamed ex-Foreign Office official on the subject of Steele s credibility: The idea his work is fake or a cowboy operation is false, completely untrue. Chris is an experienced and highly regarded professional. He s not the sort of person who will simply pass on gossip.   If he puts something in a report, he believes there s sufficient credibility in it for it to be worth considering. Chris is a very straight guy. He could not have survived in the job he was in if he had been prone to flights of fancy or doing things in an ill-considered way. In other words, Steele is a straight-shooter, so it s worth paying attention to what he has to say. Or so the Guardian assures us. That is the way the CIA and the FBI, not to mention the British government, regarded him, too,  it adds, so presumably Clapper felt the same way.What is Afoot?So what does it all mean? Simply that U.S. intelligence agencies believed that the dossier came from a reliable source and that, as a consequence, there was a significant possibility that Trump was a  Siberian candidate,  as Times columnist Paul Krugman once described him. They therefore sent out multiple copies of a two-page summary on the assumption that at least one would find its way to the press.Even if Clapper & Co. took no position concerning the dossier s contents, they knew that preparing and distributing such a summary amounted to a tacit endorsement. They also knew, presumably, that it would provide editors with an excuse to go public. If the CIA, FBI, and National Security Agency feel that Steele s findings are worthy of attention, then why shouldn t the average reader have an opportunity to examine them as well?How did Clapper expect Trump to respond when presented with allegations that he was vulnerable to Russian blackmail and potentially under the Kremlin s thumb? Did he expect him to hang his head in shame, break into great racking sobs, and admit that it was all true? If so, did Clapper \then plan to place a comforting hand on Trump s shoulder and suggest, gently but firmly, that it was time to step aside and allow a trusted insider like Mike Pence to take the reins?Based on the sturm und drang of the last few days, the answer is very possibly yes. If so, the gambit failed when Trump, in his usual high-voltage manner, denounced the dossier as  fake news  and sailed into the intelligence agencies for behaving like something out of  Nazi Germany. The intelligence community s hopes, if that s what they were, were dashed.All of which is thoroughly unprecedented by American political standards. After all, this is a country that takes endless pride in the peaceful transfer of power every four years or so. Yet here was the intelligence community attempting to short-circuit the process by engineering Trump s removal before he even took office.But the Guardian then upped the ante even more by suggesting that the CIA continue with the struggle. Plainly, the Republican congressional leadership has  no appetite  for an inquiry into Steele s findings, the paper s New York correspondent, Ed Pilkington, wrote, adding: That leaves the intelligence agencies. The danger for Trump here is that he has so alienated senior officials, not least by likening them to Nazis, that he has hardly earned their loyalty. What was the Guardian suggesting   that disloyal intelligence agents keep on searching regardless? And what if they come up with what they claim is a smoking gun?Explained Pilkington:  To take a flight of fancy, what if it [i.e. Steele s findings] were substantiated? That would again come down to a question of politics. No US president has ever been forced out of office by impeachment (Richard Nixon resigned before the vote; Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were acquitted by the Senate). Any such procedure would have to be prepared and approved by a majority of the House of Representatives, and then passed to the Senate for a two-thirds majority vote. As the Republicans hold the reins in both chambers, it would take an almighty severing of ties between Trump and his own party to even get close to such a place. It s a long shot, but the Guardian s recommendation is that rogue agents keep on digging until they strike pay dirt, at which point they should go straight to Congress and persuade   if not pressure   the Republican leadership to initiate the process of throwing Trump out of office.This is not the same as sending an armored column to attack Capitol Hill, but it s close. Essentially, the Guardian was calling on the intelligence agencies to assume ultimate responsibility regarding who can sit in the Oval Office and who cannot Continue this story at Consortium NewsREAD MORE ELECTIONS NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"January 14, 2017"
23058,Chinese Media Warns of ‘War’ with US Following Tillerson’s Remarks South China Sea," 21st Century Wire says During yesterday s cabinet confirmation hearing in Washington DC, hawkish comments made by President-Elect Trump s Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson were very pleasing to pro-war Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham. Not so for Chinese war hawks Tillerson s remarks referred to the 3,000 acres of reclaimed land in the South China Sea in the Spratly Island chain, presumably for use by the Chinese Navy, but also as a shipping resource. China denies the new facilities will restrict freedom of movement for any international shipping.It s important to note that there is a tremendous amount of pressure being put to bear on the incoming Trump Administration by neoconservatives and perpetual war advocates like McCain, Graham, Tom Cotton, Marco Rubio and others. This relentless pressure appeared to affect Tillerson during yesterday s hearings.In response, a Chinese Communist Party publication penned a scathing OpEd in response to Tillerson s comments .Telegraphlocking Chinese access to islands in the South China Sea would require the US to  wage war , an influential Chinese state-run tabloid said on Friday, after US Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson suggested the strategy on Wednesday. The media salvo from China is the latest sign of increased tensions between the countries since President-elect Donald Trump accepted a telephone call from Taiwan s leader, Tsai Ing-wen.Mr Tillerson told his confirmation hearing before the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he wanted to send a signal to China that their access to islands in the disputed South China Sea  is not going to be allowed . He did not elaborate.The United States would have to  wage a large-scale war  in the South China Sea to prevent Chinese access to the islands, the Global Times said in an English language editorial.[ ] Tillerson had better bone up on nuclear power strategies if he wants to force a big nuclear power to withdraw from its own territories,  the paper added Continue this story at The TelegraphREAD MORE CHINA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire China FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"January 13, 2017"
23059,DODGY DOSSIER: The Trump-Russia Dossier Was Funded by Political Rivals,"21st Century Wire says This week an unverified 35-page document concerning President-elect Donald Trump s alleged ties to Russia had been published by Buzzfeed. The so-called dossier, that levied unfounded accusations against Trump was initially given oxygen by CNN and included an unsubstantiated sexual blackmail scenario contained within the leaked US intelligence summary.It is too early to tell exactly what the implications of the leaked intelligence dossier will be   but there s no doubt that it has compounded an already tense relationship between Trump, the FBI, CIA and Trump s political rivals moving forward   THE DOSSIER    During Trump s first press conference he fired back at Buzzfeed for publishing unconfirmed intelligence claims. (Image Source: Slate)Earlier this week, during the president-elect s first press conference, Trump admonished the website Buzzfeed (part of the NBC Universal media empire) for publishing the intelligence dossier, even calling the site a failing pile of garbage  at the press conference. The over-the-top intelligence report sent a shockwave through social media and mainstream outlets alike, mostly due to the salacious nature of the unproven details it contained.Following the dossier s release, Trump refused to take a question from the CNN reporter Jim Acosta. The day before, CNN had been heavily promoting the fake dossier published by Buzzfeed. Watch as the president-elect calls the mainstream media outlet fake news While much has been made of Buzzfeed s role in publishing unconfirmed anonymous claims (and rightfully so), the public should also wonder why the US intelligence community would leak such information which was financed by Trump s political rivals   a spiked dossier that peddled sordid sexual perversions wrapped-up in an alleged Russian blackmail plot.The Trump-Russia  dossier  also appears to contain outright fabrications in the case of Trump s lawyer, Michael Cohen, who according to the dossier, he allegedly held secret meetings with Kremlin officials in Prague. This doctored intelligence, turned out to be false.Donald Trump took to social media to describe the allegations   even blasting the intelligence community s role in the so-called dossier According to one report by the New York Times, the dossier was produced by the Washington-based PR firm Fusion GPS, a Democratic party friendly firm that has also been employed by Planned Parenthood. During the course of 2016, Trump heavily criticized Planned Parenthood over controversial issues associated with the NGO s abortion practices.In October of 2015, the staunchly left-wing outlet, Mother Jones skirted around the apparent Russian-Trump related memo/dossier, which had already been circulating on Capitol Hill and was hinted at by former Democratic Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid, just before the 2016 presidential election: On Monday, NBC News reported that the FBI has mounted a preliminary inquiry into the foreign business ties of Paul Manafort, Trump s former campaign chief. But Reid s recent note hinted at more than the Page, or Manafort affairs. And a former senior intelligence officer for a Western country who specialized in Russian counterintelligence tells Mother Jones that in recent months he provided the bureau with memos, based on his recent interactions with Russian sources, contending the Russian government has for years tried to co-opt and assist Trump and that the FBI requested more information from him. The Duran adds the following details outlining Reid s role and that of US Senator John McCain in spreading the contents of the dossier: Mother Jones writer David Corn referred to the documents in a late October column. Harry Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson tweeted Tuesday that the outgoing Senate Democratic leader had seen the documents before writing a public letter to FBI director James Comey about Trump s ties to Russia. And CNN reported Tuesday that Arizona Republican John McCain gave a  full copy  of the memos to FBI Director James Comey on December 9, but that the FBI already had copies of many of the memos. Flash forward to January 10th, where The Washington Post primed the public just prior to the dossier release on Buzzfeed, and after a string of delays concerning an apparent US intelligence briefing that alleged Russia s meddling in the 2016 US presidential election cycle: A classified report delivered to President Obama and President-elect Donald Trump last week included a section summarizing allegations that Russian intelligence services have compromising material and information on Trump s personal life and finances, U.S. officials said.The officials said that U.S. intelligence agencies have not corroborated those allegations but believed that the sources involved in the reporting were credible enough to warrant inclusion of their claims in the highly classified report on Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Trump, however, replied Tuesday night with a tweet declaring:  FAKE NEWS   A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!  Early Wednesday, he accused the intelligence community of taking  one last shot at me. In a shocking turn of events, it was revealed that elements of the Trump-Russia  dossier  seemed to have been passed through media and intelligence connected insiders on Capitol Hill for months.Furthermore, the dossier appears to have been compiled by an  ex-MI6 spy  named Christopher Steele of the security firm Orbis Business Intelligence Ltd who was hired by PR firm Fusion GPS who had previously defended Planned Parenthood over unsafe and ethically questionable abortion practices.On January 11th, the NY Times reported the following developments: Last June, after evidence of Russian hacking of Democratic targets surfaced, Fusion GPS hired a retired British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, to investigate Mr. Trump s ties to Russia. The US intelligence dossier implicating Trump, also revealed a decidedly politically charged backdrop, while suggesting rather ridiculously, that Russia s political influence on Trump has spanned some  five years  by courting the president-elect with various sweetener business deals  supposedly offered via the Kremlin. The allegedly damning report also contends that Trump was supplied with  a regular flow of intelligence  on the Democratic party and other political rivals. But perhaps the real kicker was the dossier s conclusion that Russian spies had collated a mostly  innocuous  report regarding Hillary Clinton as stated by the UK s Guardian.QUESTION: Was the Trump-Russia dossier a part of a  deep state  smear campaign, or is there more to it?The NY Times included the following details, adding to a growing list of those who would be politically motivated to help produce such a report concerning Trump: After it became clear that Mr. Trump would be the Republican nominee, Democratic clients who supported Hillary Clinton began to pay Fusion GPS for this same opposition research. Glenn Greenwald from the Intercept published the following article that provided analysis of the politically motivated dossier. Here s a passage of Greenwald s scathing review of the intelligence crafted hit-piece on Trump and Russia this week: But [the left] cheering for the CIA and its shadowy allies to unilaterally subvert the U.S. election and impose its own policy dictates on the elected president is both warped and self-destructive. Empowering the very entities that have produced the most shameful atrocities and systemic deceit over the last six decades is desperation of the worst kind. Demanding that evidence-free, anonymous assertions be instantly venerated as Truth   despite emanating from the very precincts designed to propagandize and lie   is an assault on journalism, democracy, and basic human rationality. And casually branding domestic adversaries who refuse to go along as traitors and disloyal foreign operatives is morally bankrupt and certain to backfire on those doing it. In late October, I published the following report regarding the alleged DDoS attack in America and the US establishment s bogus Russian  election hack  claims   all timed perfectly with the rise and eventual nomination of Donald Trump. Tie this thread in with the recent dossier allegations against the president-elect and you can see what could be a potential last-ditch effort in the form of a PR created coups d tat: In this age of America s new and improved trial by media format, you can expect a litany of unfounded accusations, along with the usual anti-Russia hyperbole and waving fingers at Washington s new go-to scapegoat Russian president Vladimir Putin.The likelihood of Russia or any other country being involved in this heavily coordinated DDoS incident falls flat, when you consider that the US media has been floating the  blame Russia  meme for months now, and even more conveniently during this 2016 US presidential election cycle, led by Vice President Joe Biden, and of course, the Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton  all blaming the Kremlin for both the DNC Leaks and the Wikileaks email dump.Indeed, as you look back at NY Times articles since the summer, the stage was being set to implant the idea of an alleged Russian cyber war being waged at the US, principally charging that they would  meddle  with the US presidential elections in 2016 by aiding Donald Trump. Here s the NY Times building the case for Washington, seemingly without the burden of proof: An unusual question is capturing the attention of cyber specialists, Russia experts and Democratic Party leaders in Philadelphia: Is Vladimir V. Putin trying to meddle in the American presidential election?Until Friday, that charge, with its eerie suggestion of a Kremlin conspiracy to aid Donald J. Trump, has been only whispered. In August, the western media s claims against Russia hit overdrive, when the  New York Times s Moscow bureau was the target of an attempted cyberattack this month. But so far, there is no evidence that the hackers, believed to be Russian, were successful. Flash forward to September here and here, as well as early October in the lead up to President Obama s decree, the Clinton-friendly outlet the NY Times had all but solidified the Russian cyber/hack claims   once again, without any definitive proof. Here s a response from Russian leadership featured on RT news discussing revelations surrounding the Trump-Russia dossier:The Kremlin said on Friday that what Buzzfeed had published  didn t merit to be called a report. We have finished the discussion of this fabrication,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov explained.  This is far from being the first such falsehood published, and it is, moreover, really quite base. One simply shouldn t pay any attention to it, as it is now appealing to the emotional frenzy that is dominating in America at the moment. Politicians from both parties have accused Trump of being in cahoots with Russia, which the Obama administration has accused of waging a massive campaign to undermine the election and swing it in favor of Trump by hacking the Democratic Party s computers and leaking the stolen emails to the whistleblower site WikiLeaks.Russia has repeatedly denied the accusations, calling them  nonsense,  while the White House has refused to provide any concrete evidence to support its allegations, claiming it was necessary to keep it secret in order to protect the sources and methods of the intelligence communities.UPDATE*  News Talk Florida disclosed the following alternative theory behind the most salacious details of the Trump-Russia dossier as told to well-known radio host Michael Savage: Thursday on WWBA 820 AM the Michael Savage s radio show there was a caller who was claiming to represent the Internet forum 4chan.  the called who called himself  John,  insisted his site was the origin of the fictional 35 page dossier painting a very salacious story about President-elect Donald Trump and reported in detail by BuzzFeed on Tuesday. A caller named John, told veteran radio host Savage that We [4chan] expected some garbage outfit like BuzzFeed to pick it up, or maybe the New York Times. We didn t expect government entities to take interest in our fan-fiction. According to Savage, 4chan s claim is that the phony story was sent to veteran Republican strategist Rick Wilson, a supporter of the presidential campaign of former CIA officer Evan McMullin, who then put it in the hands of the CIA. It s hard to verify all of 4chan s claims but this latest development does add another intriguing layer to the Trump-Russia intelligence dossier.Here s a YouTube clip featuring Michael Savage with  John  on Savage Nation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4CsyXNHbBYQUESTION: Are the neoliberals and neocons in Washington working to unseat Trump through a made up honey pot plot or is this just one aspect of a larger scheme against the president-elect?Ron Paul Institute examines John McCain s role in the dodgy Trump-Russia dossier below . Daniel Mcadams Ron Paul Institute We all know what money laundering is. When you need to hide the fact that the money in your possession comes by way of nefarious sources, you transfer it through legitimate sources and it appears clean on the other end. It s standard practice among thieves, extortionists, drug dealers, and the like.The same practice can even be used to  clean  intelligence that comes by dubious sources, and sometimes even US Senators may involve themselves in such dark activities. Case in point US Senator John McCain (R-AZ), whose virulent opposition to Donald Trump is outmatched only by his total dedication to fomenting a new cold (or hot?) war with Russia.While the world was caught up in the more salacious passages from a purported opposition research report on Donald Trump showing all manner of collusion with Putin s Russia   and Russia s possession of blackmail-able kompromat on Trump   something very interesting was revealed about the custody of the information. The  dossier  on Trump seemed to follow two chains of custody. One involved the media, which in October were given and encouraged to publish the  report  by the authors of the report (or their sponsors), purportedly a former British intelligence officer working for a private intelligence company. Only David Corn of Mother Jones bit, and his resulting story picked over the report to construct a mess of innuendo on Trump s relation to Russia that was short on any evidence.The other chain of custody is what interests us. Remember, we have a dubious report constructed for the purpose of discrediting Donald Trump, which was first commissioned by one of his Republican primary rivals and later completed under the patronage of someone in Hillary s camp. It was created for a specific political purpose, which may have tainted its reception among more objective governmental sources had that been known. Enter John McCain. According to media reports, the dossier was handed to Sen. McCain   again, a strong Trump opponent and proponent of conflict with Russia   by a former UK ambassador (who presumably received it from the source, a former British intelligence officer).Senator McCain then felt duty-bound to bring this  intelligence report  directly (and privately) to the personal attention of FBI Director James Comey. From this hand-off to Comey, the report then became part of the Intelligence Community s assessment of Russian interference in the US presidential election.Senator McCain is the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, one of the most powerful members of the US Senate. Consider the impact of being handed a strange report by some private intelligence-firm-for-hire or a media outlet versus being handed a report by one of the most powerful men in the US government. McCain s involving himself in the case gave the report a sense of legitimacy that it would not otherwise have had. Was this  laundering  intentional on his part? We do not know, but given his position on Trump and Russia that possibility must be considered.More from the the Ron Paul Institute here .READ MORE MSM LIES AT: 21st Century Wire MSM FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE NOW & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"January 13, 2017"

23063,Grizzly Miss-Steppe: How Washington Post Rewrote its Fake News Story on ‘Russian Hack’ of Vermont Power Grid," MEDIA MELTDOWN: Many now believe that Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has transformed the Washington Post from a  paper of record  into the world s most expensive fake news blog.Kalev Leetaru  ForbesThe Washington Post sparked a wave of fear when it ran the breathless headline  Russian hackers penetrated U.S. electricity grid through a utility in Vermont, U.S. officials say. The lead sentence offered  A code associated with the Russian hacking operation dubbed Grizzly Steppe by the Obama administration has been detected within the system of a Vermont utility, according to U.S. officials  and continued  While the Russians did not actively use the code to disrupt operations of the utility, according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss a security matter, the penetration of the nation s electrical grid is significant because it represents a potentially serious vulnerability. Yet, it turns out this narrative was false and as the chronology below will show, illustrates how effectively false and misleading news can ricochet through the global news echo chamber through the pages of top tier newspapers that fail to properly verify their facts.The original article was posted online on the Washington Post s website at 7:55PM EST. Using the Internet Archive s Wayback Machine, we can see that sometime between 9:24PM and 10:06PM the Post updated the article to indicate that multiple computer systems at the utility had been breached ( computers  plural), but that further data was still being collected:  Officials said that it is unclear when the code entered the Vermont utility s computers, and that an investigation will attempt to determine the timing and nature of the intrusion.  Several paragraphs of additional material were added between 8PM and 10PM, claiming and contextualizing the breach as part of a broader campaign of Russian hacking against the US, including the DNC and Podesta email breaches.Despite the article ballooning from 8 to 18 paragraphs, the publication date of the article remained unchanged and no editorial note was appended, meaning that a reader being forwarded a link to the article would have no way of knowing the article they were seeing was in any way changed from the original version published 2 hours prior.Yet, as the Post s story ricocheted through the politically charged environment, other media outlets and technology experts began questioning the Post s claims and the utility company itself finally issued a formal statement at 9:37PM EST, just an hour and a half after the Post s publication, pushing back on the Post s claims:  We detected the malware in a single Burlington Electric Department laptop not connected to our organization s grid systems. We took immediate action to isolate the laptop and alerted federal officials of this finding. From Russian hackers burrowed deep within the US electrical grid, ready to plunge the nation into darkness at the flip of a switch, an hour and a half later the story suddenly became that a single non-grid laptop had a piece of malware on it and that the laptop was not connected to the utility grid in any way.However, it was not until almost a full hour after the utility s official press release (at around 10:30PM EST) that the Post finally updated its article, changing the headline to the more muted  Russian operation hacked a Vermont utility, showing risk to U.S. electrical grid security, officials say  and changed the body of the article to note  Burlington Electric said in a statement that the company detected a malware code used in the Grizzly Steppe operation in a laptop that was not connected to the organization s grid systems. The firm said it took immediate action to isolate the laptop and alert federal authorities.  Yet, other parts of the article, including a later sentence claiming that multiple computers at the utility had been breached, remained intact.The following morning, nearly 11 hours after changing the headline and rewriting the article to indicate that the grid itself was never breached and the  hack  was only an isolated laptop with malware, the Post still had not appended any kind of editorial note to indicate that it had significantly changed the focus of the article.This is significant, as one driving force of fake news is that as much of 60% of the links shared on social media are shared based on the title alone, with the sharer not actually reading the article itself. Thus, the title assigned to an article becomes the story itself and the Post s incorrect title meant that the story that spread virally through the national echo chamber was that the Russians had hacked into the US power grid.Only after numerous outlets called out the Post s changes did the newspaper finally append an editorial note at the very bottom of the article more than half a day later saying  An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that Russian hackers had penetrated the U.S. electric grid. Authorities say there is no indication of that so far. The computer at Burlington Electric that was hacked was not attached to the grid. Yet, even this correction is not a true reflection of public facts as known. The utility indicated only that a laptop was found to contain malware that has previously been associated with Russian hackers. As many pointed out, the malware in question is actually available for purchase online, meaning anyone could have used it and its mere presence is not a guarantee of Russian government involvement. Moreover, a malware infection can come from many sources, including visiting malicious websites and thus the mere presence of malware on a laptop computer does not necessarily indicate that Russian government hackers launched a coordinated hacking campaign to penetrate that machine   the infection could have come from something as simple as an employee visiting an infected website on a work computer.Moreover, just as with the Santa Claus and the dying child story, the Post story went viral and was widely reshared, leading to embarrassing situations like CNBC tweeting out the story and then having to go back and retract the story.Particularly fascinating that the original Post story mentioned that there were only two major power utilities in Vermont and that Burlington Electric was one of them, meaning it would have been easy to call both companies for comment. However, while the article mentions contacting DHS for comment, there is no mention of any kind that the Post reached out to either of the two utilities for comment. Given that Burlington issued its formal statement denying the Post s claims just an hour and a half later, this would suggest that had the Post reached out to the company it likely could have corrected its story prior to publication Continue this story at ForbesREAD MORE MSM FAKE NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire MSM Watch FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"January 9, 2017"
23064,Robert Parry: US Intel Report on ‘Russian Hack’ Still Lacks Proof,"Consortium News Exclusive: Despite mainstream media acceptance, the U.S. intelligence community s assessment on alleged Russian  hacking  still lacks hard public evidence, a case of  trust-us  by politicized spy agencies, writes Robert Parry.By Robert ParryRepeating an accusation over and over again is not evidence that the accused is guilty, no matter how much  confidence  the accuser asserts about the conclusion. Nor is it evidence just to suggest that someone has a motive for doing something. Many conspiracy theories are built on the notion of  cui bono    who benefits   without following up the supposed motive with facts.But that is essentially what the U.S. intelligence community has done regarding the dangerous accusation that Russian President Vladimir Putin orchestrated a covert information campaign to influence the outcome of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election in favor of Republican Donald Trump.Just a day after Director of National Intelligence James Clapper [image, left] vowed to go to the greatest possible lengths to supply the public with the evidence behind the accusations, his office released a 25-page report that contained no direct evidence that Russia delivered hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman John Podesta to WikiLeaks.The DNI report amounted to a compendium of reasons to suspect that Russia was the source of the information   built largely on the argument that Russia had a motive for doing so because of its disdain for Democratic nominee Clinton and the potential for friendlier relations with Republican nominee Trump.But the case, as presented, is one-sided and lacks any actual proof. Further, the continued use of the word  assesses    as in the U.S. intelligence community  assesses  that Russia is guilty   suggests that the underlying classified information also may be less than conclusive because, in intelligence-world-speak,  assesses  often means  guesses. The DNI report admits as much, saying,  Judgments are not intended to imply that we have proof that shows something to be a fact. Assessments are based on collected information, which is often incomplete or fragmentary, as well as logic, argumentation, and precedents. But the report s assessment is more than just a reasonable judgment based on a body of incomplete information. It is tendentious in that it only lays out the case for believing in Russia s guilt, not reasons for doubting that guilt.A Risky BetFor instance, while it is true that many Russian officials, including President Putin, considered Clinton to be a threat to worsen the already frayed relationship between the two nuclear superpowers, the report ignores the downside for Russia trying to interfere with the U.S. election campaign and then failing to stop Clinton, which looked like the most likely outcome until Election Night.If Russia had accessed the DNC and Podesta emails and slipped them to WikiLeaks for publication, Putin would have to think that the National Security Agency, with its exceptional ability to track electronic communications around the world, might well have detected the maneuver and would have informed Clinton.So, on top of Clinton s well-known hawkishness, Putin would have risked handing the expected incoming president a personal reason to take revenge on him and his country. Historically, Russia has been very circumspect in such situations, usually holding its intelligence collections for internal purposes only, not sharing them with the public.While it is conceivable that Putin decided to take this extraordinary risk in this case   despite the widely held view that Clinton was a shoo-in to defeat Trump   an objective report would have examined this counter argument for him not doing so.But the DNI report was not driven by a desire to be evenhanded; it is, in effect, a prosecutor s brief, albeit one that lacks any real evidence that the accused is guilty. Further undercutting the credibility of the DNI report is that it includes a seven-page appendix, dating from 2012, that is an argumentative attack on RT, the Russian government-backed television network, which is accused of portraying  the US electoral process as undemocratic. The proof for that accusation includes RT s articles on  voting machine vulnerabilities  although virtually every major U.S. news organizations has run similar stories, including some during the last campaign on the feasibility of Russia hacking into the actual voting process, something that even U.S. intelligence says didn t happen.The reports adds that further undermining Americans  faith in the U.S. democratic process, RT broadcast, hosted and advertised third-party candidate debates.  Apparently, the DNI s point is that showing Americans that there are choices beyond the two big parties is somehow seditious. The RT hosts asserted that the US two-party system does not represent the views of at least one-third of the population and is a  sham,  the report said. Yet, polls have shown that large numbers of Americans would prefer more choices than the usual two candidates and, indeed, most Western democracies have multiple parties, So, the implicit RT criticism of the U.S. political process is certainly not out of the ordinary.The report also takes RT to task for covering the Occupy Wall Street movement and for reporting on the environmental dangers from  fracking,  topics cited as further proof that the Russian government was using RT to weaken U.S. public support for Washington s policies (although, again, these are topics of genuine public interest).Behind the CurtainThough it s impossible for an average U.S. citizen to know precisely what the U.S. intelligence community may have in its secret files, some former NSA officials who are familiar with the agency s eavesdropping capabilities say Washington s lack of certainty suggests that the NSA does not possess such evidence.Binney, in an article co-written with former CIA analyst Ray McGovern, said,  With respect to the alleged interference by Russia and WikiLeaks in the U.S. election, it is a major mystery why U.S. intelligence feels it must rely on  circumstantial evidence,  when it has NSA s vacuum cleaner sucking up hard evidence galore. What we know of NSA s capabilities shows that the email disclosures were from leaking, not hacking. For instance, that s the view of William Binney, who retired as NSA s technical director of world military and geopolitical analysis and who created many of the collection systems still used by NSA.There is also the fact that both WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and one of his associates, former British Ambassador Craig Murray, have denied that the purloined emails came from the Russian government. Going further, Murray has suggested that there were two separate sources, the DNC material coming from a disgruntled Democrat and the Podesta emails coming from possibly a U.S. intelligence source, since the Podesta Group represents Saudi Arabia and other foreign governments Continue this article at Consortium NewsREAD MORE  RUSSIAN HACK  NEWS AT: 21WIRE Russia Files",Middle-east,"January 8, 2017"
23065,LAST MINUTE GOV’T GRAB: Obama Admin Decrees DHS will ‘Take Control’ of US Election Systems," 21st Century Wire says Now we can see part of the Obama Administration s end game in cooking-up the  Russian Election Hack  Hoax. After much hysteria, followed by hype over the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper s report release this weekend   claiming that Russia and Vladimir Putin altered the results of the 2016 US Elections in favor of winner Donald Trump, what we can see so far, the report contains no evidence at all. The much anticipated report has a number of basic errors, wild assumptions and misinformation. Some critics have labeled Clapper s report beyond a joke.Back on Sept 1, 2016, 21WIRE warned readers that Obama appointee, Jeh Johnson (image, left), head of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), was attempting to wrestle control of US election systems away from the 50 States, who have been the guardians of these systems since the founding of the United States, placing the election system instead under the control the federal DHS. On Friday, he actually did it   announcing the he believes this is the right thing to do   and justifies this federal power-grab by carefully inferring that the 2016 elections were  hacked  in a cyber security breach.Despite the fact nearly every state and local body opposed the federal move, the White House and its pretorian DHS tool quietly snuck it through anyway. As Johnson is a lawyer (like most Obama appointees) he was very careful to mince his words, stating that,  cyber attacks on this country are becoming more sophisticated, and bad cyber actors   ranging from nation state.  Lawyerspeak aside, Jeh Johnson is clearly referring to Russia.This incredible decree was issued by DHS head   conveniently under the cover of the DNI s empty Russian Hack  report, and also under the cover of the highly questionable  Active Shooter  drama at Fort Lauderdale Airport on Friday afternoon.For any intelligent person watching, it s hardly a coincidence that President Obama issued such an incredible federal power-grab on a day such as this.Here is Friday s rather pompous statement from Jeh Johnson the US Department of Homeland Security Statement by Secretary Jeh Johnson on the Designation of Election Infrastructure as a Critical Infrastructure SubsectorRelease Date: January 6, 2017 For Immediate Release Office of the Press Secretary Contact: 202-282-8010I have determined that election infrastructure in this country should be designated as a subsector of the existing Government Facilities critical infrastructure sector. Given the vital role elections play in this country, it is clear that certain systems and assets of election infrastructure meet the definition of critical infrastructure, in fact and in law.I have reached this determination so that election infrastructure will, on a more formal and enduring basis, be a priority for cybersecurity assistance and protections that the Department of Homeland Security provides to a range of private and public sector entities. By  election infrastructure,  we mean storage facilities, polling places, and centralized vote tabulations locations used to support the election process, and information and communications technology to include voter registration databases, voting machines, and other systems to manage the election process and report and display results on behalf of state and local governments.Prior to reaching this determination, my staff and I consulted many state and local election officials; I am aware that many of them are opposed to this designation. It is important to stress what this designation does and does not mean. This designation does not mean a federal takeover, regulation, oversight or intrusion concerning elections in this country. This designation does nothing to change the role state and local governments have in administering and running elections.The designation of election infrastructure as critical infrastructure subsector does mean that election infrastructure becomes a priority within the National Infrastructure Protection Plan. It also enables this Department to prioritize our cybersecurity assistance to state and local election officials, but only for those who request it. Further, the designation makes clear both domestically and internationally that election infrastructure enjoys all the benefits and protections of critical infrastructure that the U.S. government has to offer. Finally, a designation makes it easier for the federal government to have full and frank discussions with key stakeholders regarding sensitive vulnerability information.Particularly in these times, this designation is simply the right and obvious thing to do.At present, there are sixteen critical infrastructure sectors, including twenty subsectors that are eligible to receive prioritized cybersecurity assistance from the Department of Homeland Security. The existing critical infrastructure sectors are:Entities within these sectors all benefit from this designation and work with us closely on cybersecurity. For example, we have developed joint cybersecurity exercises with numerous companies within the communications, information technology, financial services and energy sectors to improve our incident response capabilities. We have also streamlined access to unclassified and classified information to critical infrastructure owners and operators in partnership with information sharing and analysis organizations. Moreover, many critical infrastructure sectors include assets and systems owned and operated by state and local governments, such as dams, healthcare and public health, and water and wastewater systems.Now more than ever, it is important that we offer our assistance to state and local election officials in the cybersecurity of their systems. Election infrastructure is vital to our national interests, and cyber attacks on this country are becoming more sophisticated, and bad cyber actors   ranging from nation states, cyber criminals and hacktivists   are becoming more sophisticated and dangerous.Further, our increasingly digital and connected world has reshaped our lives. It has streamlined everyday tasks and changed the way we communicate. But, just as the continually evolving digital age has improved our quality of life, it has also introduced an array of cyber threats and implications.Cybersecurity continues to be a top priority for DHS, as it is for state and local election officials across the country. This designation enables the states, should they request it, to leverage the full scope of cybersecurity services we can make available to them.21WIRE editors note: More context on this story below  LAST-MINUTE POWER GRAB: Jeh Johnson Obama and Biden celebrate another federal power-grab by the DHS.

23066,James Clapper Himself Debunks “Russia Hacked US Election” Meme,"21st Century Wire says We ve seen it over and over again in the mainstream media,  Russia Hacked the US Election.  It has been a pervasive meme in the media ever since Donald J. Trump won the US Presidential election and it inspires consumers of mainstream media to believe that Russia actually used cyber intelligence agents to hack into the computers that are used to track the voting. Surveys show that many Americans believe that there was a literal computer hack of the election to change the results.Americans who believe this are duped by a false meme that has been bludgeoned into their psyches by their mainstream media outlets. James Clapper, head of all US intelligence, admitted while speaking at the Congressional Armed Services Committee that Russia had no hand in changing the vote tallies and did  nothing of that sort. Washingtons Blog reports Due to incredibly sloppy reporting by the mainstream media   constantly repeating the phrase  Russia hacked the election    many Americans believed that Russia literally changed votes on election day.A YouGov poll from last month found that half of all Democrats believe that Russia directly tampered with vote tallies:But today, the head of all U.S. intelligence   James Clapper   told Congress (specifically the Armed Services Committee): They did not change any vote tallies or anything of that sort.

23067,Skeptics Unconvinced After Release of Feds’ Latest Report On ‘Russian Hack of DNC’,"21st Century Wire says In the wake of the Friday release of the ODNI s 25 page report from  US intelligence agencies  (notice how they don t even specify the agency names anymore in these reports) on the alleged Russian hack of Clinton campaign related DNC computers, cyber security experts are still not convinced that there is any credible evidence supporting the theory.The Feds site the need to keep their sources secret as the reason for the lack of specific evidence of the  hacks  (see full 25 page report embedded at WIRED) in the report but is this a legitimate concern when the forensic evidence is likely located in simple text files and virus protection software logs. Doesn t the government have the biggest data collection network monitoring facility in the world? Can the evidence not be shown via server traffic logs that wouldn t expose any  sources ?Wired brings some analysis on the 25 page report and cyber security professionals response to it  Take notice of the language when WIRED is discussing the other side of this argument, referencing  unknown sources  speaking to The Washington Post, (WashPost, who ve just been caught more than once pushing fake Russiaphobia stories in recent weeks).  Andy Greenberg WIREDOn Friday, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence finally released a declassified report on Russia s role in influencing the US election. And though it offers the most detailed official analysis yet of Russia s operations, critics in the cybersecurity community say it lacks the still-secret evidence needed to persuade skeptics that analysis is true.The ODNI s 25-page report (embedded below) from US intelligence agencies lays out a vast Russian intelligence operation that extends from hacking both Democratic and Republican targets to propaganda campaigns to troll-fueled social media disinformation. It re-asserts the intelligence community s findings that the Kremlin is behind breaches of the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Hillary Clinton s campaign, and even state election board websites. And the express intention of those operations, the report states, was to not only disrupt the American electoral process, but to elect Donald Trump. Russia s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency,  the report reads.  We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments. Even so, the report leaves out the much hoped-for technical evidence that informed these conclusions. In its  Scope and Sourcing  section, the report explains that this evidence exists, but can t be declassified. And that means the report won t satisfy the majority of the cybersecurity community that believes Russia hacked Democratic targets but has demanded more evidence, let alone the diehard deniers of the Kremlin s fingerprints.  Seeing more of the context in which this happened does make me a little more trusting that this really was Russia,  says Robert Graham, an analyst for the cybersecurity firm Erratasec who has closely followed the Russian hacking investigation.  But knowing what data they probably have, they could have given us more details. And that really pisses me off. Knowing what data they probably have, they could have given us more details. And that really pisses me off. Robert GrahamOver the past weeks, rumors circulated that senior intelligence officials had pushed for far more of the agencies  evidence pointing to Russia to be declassified and revealed to the public, according to Susan Hennessey, a former NSA attorney. But that cards-on-the-table approach, which likely would have sacrificed intelligence sources and methods in favor of more public transparency, didn t make it to the final report.  This isn t a remotely risk-embracing document,  says Hennessey.  There s alway a tension between those who think it s worth bringing forward sources and methods and those that don t. It s clear that those with very conservative views about protecting sources and methods prevailed. 1The unclassified report is underwhelming at best. There is essentially no new information for those who have been paying attention.  Susan Hennessey (@Susan_Hennessey) January 6, 2017One skeptic, at least, has somewhat altered his viewpoint based on the intel agencies  case: Donald Trump. After the president-elect was briefed Friday by the heads of the NSA, FBI, CIA, and Office of the Director of National Intelligence, he offered an oblique statement that neither confirmed nor denied his belief that Russia hacked Democratic targets.  While Russia, China, other countries, other groups and people are constantly trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our government institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democratic National Committee,  Trump s statement reads,  there was no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines. But even that mealy-mouthed comment no intelligence officials had claimed Russia hacked American voting machines contrasts sharply with Trump s past denials. Until now, the president-elect has remained doggedly skeptical and even willfully ignorant of the evidence tying Russia s government to the attacks. He s blamed the intrusions on everyone from China to a 400-pound hacker in New Jersey to the Democratic party itself. Rather than call for investigations into the hacking, he s said the country needs to  move on.  At times he has even refused to admit any hacks took place. He continued those assertions even after he began receiving classified briefings on the attacks as the Republican presidential candidate, and then after US intelligence agencies stated that the Kremlin was responsible in early October, and even after he was elected and gained full access to presidential briefings from the intelligence community. As late as Friday morning, ahead of his own personal briefing on the full report, he continued to refer to China as the possible source of the attack and called the investigation into Russia a  political witch hunt.  (He also wrote on Twitter that he s asking Congress to investigate the unauthorized early leak of today s report to NBC News, showing that he has interest in investigating some leaks, at least.)The report makes a few new assertions: stating plainly that WikiLeaks received hacked DNC data from Russian intelligence, and outlining a broader history of Russian meddling in US elections. It spends significant ink on Russia s state-sponsored propaganda efforts, and delves into state-sponsored social media disinformation strategies and widespread Russian media claims that the US is not a functioning democracy. The report points out, for example, that the RT America television channel has been running stories about the US s weak voting infrastructure and alleged election fraud since November 2012.RT s role as a distributor for Russian government propaganda is hardly news, though. And while data leaks and disinformation campaigns were central to last year s campaign meddling, the report seems to give them disproportionate weight over technical hacking, perhaps because those sections of the report were redacted.In terms of proving the core claim that Russia hacked American political targets, though, Friday s report is sure to leave any skeptic not privy to classified briefings briefings unconvinced: It fails to include even the already public evidence visible to the cybersecurity community over the last six months, which drew a thick dotted line from the DNC hack to the Kremlin. A hacker calling himself Guccifer 2.0, for instance, in June claimed to be a lone Romanian hacker responsible for the breach. But the stolen DNC files he published on the web and also said he d leaked to WikiLeaks contained telltale Russian-language error messages. A piece of malware known as X-Agent was used in both the DNC hack and previous attacks long believed to be Russian intelligence operations. And an analysis of the URL shortening service used by the hacker who stole the Gmail password of Clinton staffer John Podesta shows that the same account was used to target more than 5,000 other Gmail accounts, including Russia-focused journalists and authors, and the spouses of American military officials.Early leaks from a classified version of the report revealed some of the evidence intelligence agencies have to implicate Russia. Unnamed intelligence officials told the Washington Post that US agents had intercepted the communications of senior Russian officials celebrating Trump s win. In another leak to Reuters, intel officials said that they d identified the intermediary who had passed files stolen by Russian hackers to WikiLeaks.The Obama administration, for its part, has for months harbored little doubt about Russia s involvement in the political attacks. In fact, it s already responded: In late December, the White House announced new targeted sanctions against Russian intelligence officials and contractors, ejected 35 Russian diplomats from the country, and seized two Russian-owned properties on American soil it said were being used for intelligence gathering. James Lewis, a cybersecurity-focused fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told WIRED at the time that it was the  the biggest retaliatory move against Russian espionage since the Cold War. But critics from Trump s presidential transition team have accused Obama of acting against Russia before proving the sanctions were warranted Continue this report at WIREDREAD MORE RUSSIAN HACK NEWS AT: 21WIRE Russian Hack Files",Middle-east,"January 8, 2017"

Santiago-Ruiz s US military background includes service in the Puerto Rico Army National Guard in 2007, according to the Department of Defense. Santiago-Ruiz was listed as a combat engineer who had been deployed to Iraq in April 2010, returning to US soil in 2011. Later in November of 2014, following a move to Alaska, he became a member of the Alaska National Guard. In August of 2016, Santiago-Ruiz was transferred to Inactive Ready Reserve.Additionally, Santiago-Ruiz was stated to be employed by an as of yet unnamed Anchorage security company while living in Alaska.According to the Associated Press and Miami s local CBS News affiliate,  The Pentagon said he [Santiago-Ruiz] went AWOL several times as a specialist during a stint with the Alaska National Guard and was demoted to private first class, the Associated Press reported. He was given a general discharge, which is lower than an honorable discharge. Earlier reports stated that Santiago-Ruiz flew on a flight from Canada. Air Canada promptly denied that the suspected airport shooter was on any of their flights. Other US mainstream outlets later stated that he arrived on an in-bound Delta Airlines flight instead.

Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) January 6, 2017Another Known Wolf?As 21 WIRE has documented over the years, many so-called shooting/terror/attacks involve individuals being monitored by security services prior to an alleged act taking place. A place where a  lone wolf  graduates into the ranks of a known wolf. In fact, very often those being watched by authorities exhibit all the tell-tale signs of a patsy or an informant, working either for a law enforcement or intelligence agency. Historically, government operators have often made use of low-life criminals, and mentally disturbed individuals to fulfill various role in entrapment stings or sometimes as bonafide actors in an actual attacks.  In any case, alleged attackers and security agencies have a dicey relationship, making any link between them highly suspect in nature.In January of 2015, a strategic security service think-tank known as The Soufan Group, reported that a larger national security threat resides with radicals who ve had a lengthy criminal background with known ties to security agencies: The Soufan Group, a New York think tank, said a better term for  lone wolves  would be  known wolves , given how many are already known to Western intelligence agencies before they strike. These individuals, acting alone or in small groups   have been on the radar of various agencies and organisations, highlighting the difficulty of effectively monitoring and managing people at the nexus of criminality and terrorism,  it said in a report this week The Fort Lauderdale shooting story rapidly emerged out of corporate media halls looking to sell the public on the latest tragic shooting in America. The Hollywood International Airport shooting has elements of other high-profile shooting events in recent history, such as the TSA/LAX shooting, the the Tucson shooting, Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting, the San Bernardino shooting attack, the Chattanooga military base shooting siege, as well as the aspects of the Aurora theater shooting and the Grand theater shooting in Lafayette and many others.Is the Fort Lauderdale airport shooter another case of a known wolf   triggered into action?The apparent Fort Lauderdale airport shooter, Santiago-Ruiz, who is said to be Puerto Rican was born in New Jersey (living in Alaska), and was well-known to authorities, having recently undergone a mental health evaluation after allegedly visiting an FBI office in Alaska where he claimed he was under  CIA mind control,  with voices in his head telling him to join ISIS : They say last November, he walked into the FBI s office in Anchorage, Alaska, claiming that  his mind was being controlled by the CIA and that it was forcing him to join ISIS. He appeared agitated and incoherent, and made disjointed statements   and although he said he didn t wish to hurt anyone, agents were concerned by his erratic behavior and decided to call local authorities, a senior federal law enforcement official said.Local police took him to a local medical facility for evaluation, and the FBI closed its assessment of Santiago after conducting database reviews, interagency checks and interviews with family members, the official said. NEW: In Nov. 2016, FLL suspect walked into FBI office in Anchorage, claiming he was being forced to fight for ISIS, sources tell CBS News.  CBS News (@CBSNews) January 6, 2017Shades of the Manchurian Candidate?We re also told that the suspect s aunt had flagged his mentally unstable condition previously. According to USA Today:Yet the troubling episode is now part of an emerging profile of a deeply disturbed man described by his aunt Friday as someone who had  lost his mind. Maria Luisa Ruiz of Union City, N.J., said her nephew, who had moved to Alaska for work as a security guard, only recently began to show signs of instability. Like a month ago, it was like he lost his mind,  she said He said he saw things. The inclusion of Santiago-Ruiz s alleged  voices  in his head, supposedly triggered by the CIA, immediately recalls another bizarre case that was also difficult to comprehend   the Navy Yard Shooter from 2013.Here s a passage from a 21WIRE report discussing the apparent Navy Yard shooter, Aaron Alexis: Rather than get caught up in the  fear campaigns  sold to us by our favorite news anchor-zombies, its important to consider another aspect of these mass shootings by making a tally of  the trigger points that media uses to manipulate public perception, as they carefully propagandize certain elements within a crisis making sure to illicit  the right  reaction from every major demographic. Is this what we are seeing in the aftermath of the Fort Lauderdale shooting?Heavy.com added the following details about the supposedly troubled Santiago-Ruiz:The shooter   whose troubled behavior had already drawn the attention of the FBI, Army, and Anchorage police   arrived Friday afternoon at the busy airport on a flight from Alaska, with the gun used in the shooting properly stored in his checked baggage, NBC News reports.One report said the shooter, who lived in Alaska, had no other luggage but the gun, which federal rules allow a person to declare at a ticket counter and check under the plane but not carry on. In addition to Santiago-Ruiz s lengthy time with the US military and the National Guard, in recent years, the suspected shooter was involved in various crimes. Here s a passage from The Daily Beast describing some of Santiago s background: According to charging documents provided by the Anchorage prosecutor s office to The Daily Beast, on January 10, 2016, Santiago verbally assaulted his then girlfriend, a 40-year old mother of one child from a previous marriage whom The Daily Beast is not naming, through a locked bathroom door, telling her to  Get the fuck out, bitch.  After he forced his way in by breaking down the door, he smacked her in the head and strangled her. By the time police arrived, Santiago had fled the scene.Santiago was arrested days later and released on the condition that he have no contact with the victim, but in February, Anchorage police found him at his girlfriend s residence and he was charged for violating the conditions of his release. That case is still pending.Alaska court records show a criminal record under Santiago s name for minor traffic infractions including operating a vehicle without insurance and a broken taillight. Records also show his landlord evicted him for non-payment of rent in February 2015.The assault case was resolved in March when Santiago entered into a deferred prosecution agreement, an alternative to adjudication where prosecutors agreed to dismiss the charges in exchange for Esteban s completion of requirements, the details of which are unknown. While Anchorage municipal prosecutor Seneca Theno told The Daily Beast that previous charges against Santiago-Ruiz are unlikely to be dropped following the airport shooting   you still have to wonder what  requirements  were asked of Santiago-Ruiz to get the alleged assault charges dropped from his record in the first place, given the brutal nature of them.FOX NEWS echoes a Sun Sentinel report,  Why the gunman may have chosen South Florida was unclear. He had no clear connection to the state aside from relatives in the Naples area, a two-hour drive away, the Sun Sentinel reported.The same FOX report adds the following about Santiago-Ruiz s alleged lengthy mental health battle: Bryan Santiago said his brother never spoke to him directly about his medical issues. We have not talked for the past three weeks,  Bryan Santiago said.  That s a bit unusual   I m in shock. He was a serious person   He was a normal person. Mass Shooting Distraction?Another aspect to these highly emotive and polarizing known wolf shooting events, is that usually they dominate US media coverage for several days. As other charged elements of an alleged shooter/attacker are propagandized, such as Santiago-Ruiz s Palestinian scarf image (seen on the left) seized upon by FOX News anchors who fused Santiago-Ruiz s allegedly  ISIS-like  hand gesture with the Gaza-Israeli conflict.The shocking scene at Fort Lauderdale s Hollywood International Airport occurred the same exact day US intelligence leaders briefed President-elect Donald Trump on so-called Russian hack allegations in the lead up to the 2016 election.Back in September of 2016, while examining the aftermath of the New York and New Jersey bomb plot/attack, we analyzed whether a deeper social engineering agenda might have been at play   as part of a larger geopolitical drama unfolded in Syria appeared to be masked by media.When looking deeper, we discovered other overlapping stories that coincided alongside the  known wolf  NYC bomber. Here s a passage that discussed the NYC attack that seemed to bury Western coverage regarding a vicious airstrike campaign that killed dozens of members of Syria s army: You have to wonder, were the events in New York and New Jersey also a weapon of mass distraction, following a major international embarrassment for the United States both at home and abroad   the brutal airstrike campaign in Syria that killed over 70 Syrian troops? This unlikely bombing incident just happened to also coincide with the UN General Assembly in NYC, where President Obama was delivering among other speeches, his War on Terror  addresses to the international community. No surprise then, with the city suddenly on  high terror alert    that Obama quickly, confidently and comfortably used his center stage spotlight at the UN, shifting into  national security  mode   boasting how quickly his police forces solved the case. It was almost if he was ready for events that weekend. Similarly, you have to consider if this new high-profile shooting event at Fort Lauderdale s Hollywood International Airport will dominate the news cycle, as the US intelligence community scrambles to prove Russian hack allegations over the next week.On January 4th ABC News reported the following: The classified report requested by President Barack Obama detailing Russia s alleged role in cyberattacks during U.S. presidential elections dating back to 2008 is now complete, and he is expected to receive the first briefing on its findings on Thursday afternoon, U.S. officials tell ABC News.President-elect Donald Trump, who said last week he would receive his briefing on the matter on Tuesday or Wednesday of this week, is scheduled to receive his briefing on Friday. Both briefings will be conducted by the heads of relevant agencies, including the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the National Security Agency, the FBI and the CIA.U.S. officials denied claims from Trump that his special briefing was delayed so the U.S. intelligence community could strengthen its case against Russia. Officials instead said there may have been a scheduling disconnect or some confusion on the part of the Trump transition team. Interestingly, other explosive high-profile stories went to the back burner, such as the Chicago kidnapping and teen torture story  and the fallout from CNN s Don Lemon following his egregious comments after the tragic racially motivated attack.Media Memory: Reports of a  Second Shooter  at Terminal 1During the later hours of the US mainstream media coverage, networks like CNN were still floating the possibility of a second shooter, as reports emerged of shots fired in the adjacent terminal housing United Airlines, Terminal 1.Interestingly, local reports also reported eye-witness accounts of a  second gunman  involved in the Fort Lauderdale shooting. Here s a passage from an ABC News affiliate discussing the reports of a second gunman at the Fort Lauderdale shooting: All day I ve heard people talking about second incidences,  Catie Rutledge wrote on Instagram.  After waiting on the tarmac for hours and hunting someone down to get our bags, we are now waiting for a bus, so that we can leave the airport. There was panic when authorities feared there was a second gunman. Law enforcement asked travelers to seek shelter. Fear prompted many to say their final good byes to loved ones. Some frightened parents were in tears as they tried to protect their children. This aspect of the case seemingly disappeared from media outlets following Santiago-Ruiz s arrest.The phenomena of multiple shooters being immediately reported after an apparent mass shooting event was also echoed during both the Orlando nightclub shooting and the San Bernardino attack in 2015.Later in the evening, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel confirmed that there was no second shooter   despite previous reports. The suspect was being interrogated by the FBI. This statement was in stark contrast to multiple witness statements made on national TV, placing the series of shots, or perhaps an additional series of shots and subsequent crowds fleeing in panic at Terminal 1  that would either be instead of Terminal 2, or in addition to it. This wasn t just an anomaly   this was backed up by at least 2 different witnesses on CNN, perhaps more in other reports which 21WIRE has yet to collate here.Was this a case of something that happened in Terminal 1  either part of a drill, or another gunman   which was memory-holed by the media and DHS, or could this be we are looking at planted witnesses who got their lines wrong? This is a fair question to ask, considering we are talking about multiple witnesses stating the shots and crowds panicking in Terminals other than the official story in Terminal 2.Here are four alternative witnesses:Witness 1: CNN s coverage of the  Active Shooter  festival at Fort Lauderdale Airport reveals yet another anomaly in their story. CNN reported the alleged shooter, Esteban Santiago, shot 5 people dead in the Delta Terminal 2, and yet, all the witnesses reported 4 shots fired in the United Terminal 1. When this witness, a father who flew in from Chicago, tells of the United T1 shots fired, CNN s reporter Boris Sanchez appears to panic, possibly then receiving a feed in his ear and then essentially tells the witness  you are wrong, there were no shots fired in United Terminal 1.  Was this bad reporting, or bad stage management by CNN? Watch:  Witness 2: Immediately after CNN s Boris Sanchez mix-up with man flying in from Chicago at United Terminal 1, another CNN witness was suddenly produced, going by the name of  Ryan Ward , interviewed by Jim Sciutto, then comes on, using very scripted language apparently in an attempt to clean-up the inconsistent statements of the last witness. Ryan Ward describes the mayhem, people running,  luggage flying  and  people screaming, gunman coming    even though he admits he was NOT in Delta Terminal 2 where police report the actual shooting took place. Ward claims he was in a wheel chair because of back surgery, but then claims he  got up and ran over  to save a little girl and  I ran back over and pushed the mom into a corner and laid on top of her . He then says that,  It does sound like it was an unsubstantiated second threat, but people certainly weren t acting like it    here he was mirroring the identical language used by the previous CNN reporters. Coincidence? Even more oddly, Ward claims he was flying Jet Blue, and that the,  Jet Blue staff were really great    only problem is that Jet Blue is in Terminal 3, and not in T1 or T2. Watch: Witness 3: Another witness, testifying multiple gunman on the scene, although the Terminal location being referenced by this 3rd witness is somewhat unclear:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBhiSblZtJs . Also, there is an additional media report by Intellihub of a pilot, in uniform and on-site, who also testifies about a loud commotion, with police in pursuit of a perpetrator seen in Terminal 1   a stark contrast to the official story: The pilot believes that  there was another shooting  in Terminal 1 that law enforcement and the F.B.I. are likely covering up.  I could hear females screaming and people running away from terminal 1. The pilot said he feels that it was definitely  some kind of combined effort to attack  the airport.In addition to that, here is a fifth witness, seen in this unconfirmed cell phone video from a female passenger out on the airport tarmac   apparently from Terminal 1, and referencing a second shooter event located after the TSA barrier   which seems to be a different location to the baggage check area:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tayCW0pTBF8 . EDITORS NOTE: If readers have any other witness reports of a  Second Shooter  or shots fired in Terminal 2, please leave them below in the comment section.Here s an ABC News feature with Mark Lea, an apparent eye-witness (later photographed the crime scene) who came  face-to-face  with Santiago-Ruiz   who also rather incredibly, managed to not get shot during the encounter Fort Lauderdale s  Active Shooter  DrillsVery often preceding an apparent shooting/attack there is the presence of mass casualty drills. Fort Lauderdale was no exception.In 2015, the Sun Sentinel reported the following: At a Fort Lauderdale cinema Wednesday, two men in camouflage gear calmly walked down the aisle and fired rifles and handguns at moviegoers.Twenty-seven volunteers were  injured  in three theaters during the drill.Fort Lauderdale police guarded and escorted paramedics wearing protective gear to tend to the wounded actors, even though the  shooters  weren t captured and blank gunfire echoed elsewhere in the Riverwalk movie complex.The agencies  goal is to speed up paramedics  responses during mass killings, domestic calls and other violent incidents. Similarly, in June of 2016, an inter-agency meeting described future protocols regarding mass drills: The meeting, held every quarter, is an opportunity for agencies to coordinate with one another and discuss the latest techniques in fighting domestic terror attacks.Last month, agencies participated in an active-shooter exercise at the Fort Lauderdale Postal Facility.In February, the group participated in Operation Heat Shield, consisting of weapons of mass destruction and an active shooting drill.Sheriff Scott Israel of Broward County Sheriff s Office and Sheriff Rick Bradshaw of Palm Beach County Sheriff s Office said these training exercises are important. With such a large law enforcement effort to tackle the active-shooter, you have to wonder why and how these events seem to coincide with major attacks on US soil.Here s a YouTube video from commentator Peekay Truth discussing aspects of this latest mass shooting tragedy in America https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYY0EgDRYgcDupes, Informants and PawnsAdditionally, as we ve mentioned before, during the aftermath of 2014 s Canadian Parliament Shooting in Ottawa, we outlined many of the primary markers used in certain terror related events globally and other mass casualty incidents often seen in America.The shocking event, like other bizarre attacks in recent years, have often distorted public opinion, pushing the populace towards new security measures in the wake of heavily coordinated and stylized crimes.The suspected Parliament Hill and National War Memorial shooter Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, (Left Image: therightscoop) had the perfect  modus operandi  and r sum  to be an informant for either a law enforcement or intelligence agency.According to the Globe and Mail, Zehaf-Bibeau was already designated as a high risk traveller by the Canadian government s security services   who had also seized his passport. Was this the reason why the Zehaf-Bibeau snapped? Was he being targeted or being pressured into becoming an informant?Other terror stooges and suspicious intelligence  informant  cases include the following:Tamerlan Tsarnaev (see his story here) Buford Rogers (see his story here) Jerad Miller (see his story here) Naji Mansour (see his story here) Quazi Mohammad Nafis (see his story here) Mohamed Osman Mohamud (see his story here) Timothy McVeigh (see his story here) Salim Benghalem (see his story here) Michael Adebolajo (see his story here) Daba Deng (see his story here) Elton Simpson (see his story here) Man Haron Monis (see his story here) Abu Hamza (see his story here) Haroon Rashid Aswat (see his story here) Glen Rodgers (see his story here) Omar Mateen (see his story here) Tashfeen Malik (see her story here) Djamel Beghal  (see his story here) Anjem Choudary (see his story here) Cherif Kouachi (see his story here) Said Kouachi (see his story here) Amedy Coulibaly (see his story here) Hayat Boumeddiene (see her story here) Salah Abdeslam (see his story here) Michael Zehaf-Bibeau (see his story here) Nidal Malik Hassan (see his story here) Abdelhakim Dekhar  (see his story here) Abdelhamid Abaaoud (see his story here) Samy Amimour (see his story here) Isma l Omar Mostefa  (see his story here) Mohamed Lahouij Bouhlel (see his story here) Anis Amri (see his story here)As we ve mentioned here at 21WIRE before, many political leaders and media operatives bang the drums of security over so-called terror  sleeper cells hiding in a nation near you   none of them acknowledge the historical fact that they themselves have also helped to harbor, grow, foment and radicalize individuals through counter-terrorism operations for decades.It is important to mention again, that the FBI created the counter-intelligence program (COINTELPRO) to influence and disrupt political factions from the inside out. Between 1956 and 1971 (including the Socialist Workers party in 1973), the FBI s controversial program infiltrated and radicalized hundreds of left-wing and right-wing groups to control and neutralize political dissidents across America.As we stated after the suspicious Oregon campus shooting in 2015, mass media has worked out their own formula for laying out a familiar series of polarizing political points in the aftermath of any  tragic  event, as they have with many others incidents. The Fort Lauderdale shooting appears once again, to purposefully redirect the public to look at a ready-made laundry list of items (in this case mental-health, supported by online rants on social media) about the persona of a shooter as an ironclad motive for a crime. The aftermath in the case of Fort Lauderdale is no different, as it rapidly descended into an overindulgent barrage of media speculation and theorizing.All too often we ve seen the  stage persona of any alleged attacker or killer being touted as hard evidence, despite the fact that even strong circumstantial evidence of any apparent crime would likely result in many hours of analysis and debate, potentially without a definitive conclusion, even if the evidence reaches a court room.For the average person, it s hard to differentiate from a drill or a real event, causing one to scrutinize the legitimacy of such an operation.In recent years, the investigative tactics of various intelligence agencies have come into question, none perhaps more dubious than the Newburgh FBI sting that involved entrapping four men to participate in a fabricated event created by the bureau. Here s a 2011 passage from The Guardian describing how an FBI informant named Shahed Hussain coerced four others into a fake terror plot: The  Newburgh Four  now languish in jail. Hussain does not. For Hussain was a fake. In fact, Hussain worked for the FBI as an informant trawling mosques in hope of picking up radicals.Yet far from being active militants, the four men he attracted were impoverished individuals struggling with Newburgh s grim epidemic of crack, drug crime and poverty. One had mental issues so severe his apartment contained bottles of his own urine. He also believed Florida was a foreign country.Hussain offered the men huge financial inducements to carry out the plot   including $250,000 to one man   and free holidays and expensive cars.As defence lawyers poured through the evidence, the Newburgh Four came to represent the most extreme form of a controversial FBI policy to use invented terrorist plots to lure targets.  There has been no case as egregious as this. It is unique in the incentive the government provided. A quarter million dollars?  said Professor Karen Greenberg, a terrorism expert at Fordham University. The whole episode seemed akin to the WTC 1993 bombing case, which involved yet another informant working alongside officials.The Gun Control & Security AgendaAs pointed out in 21WIRE during 2015 s Oregon campus shooting, the primary focus for mass media concerning the Fort Lauderdale incident, will now be all of the hot button socio-political issues including  gun control-reform  and those concerned over  mental illness  background checks, along with those who constitutionally oppose such restrictive legislation.It should be obvious by now that events like Fort Lauderdale, along with other  mass-shootings , have become a sharp catalyst to usher in calls for endless new  mass shooting  protocols, inter-agency  fusion ,  first-responder  emergency medical protocols, and also for injecting more and more military terminology into civilian life   with the media playing a critical role in steering the public away from questioning any of the dubious elements surrounding any shooting event.In a sense, the media is helping to nudge these shooting events out of the forensic sphere and into the political arena as quickly as possible, effectively closing the feedback loop of concerned citizens and those who may have been affected by an event.The Fort Lauderdale shooting has prompted the mainstream media to feed into concerns over airport security, gun ownership and a persons mental health background. All of media s fear-inducing drama regarding the Fort Lauderdale shooting boils down to a contentious battle over gun reform and mental health as the Obama administration comes to a close. No doubt this latest shooting will give cause to new security measures in airports across America.Here s another look at outgoing President Obama discussing his frustration on gun control in a  legacy  interview with the BBC from 2015   amazingly, only a few hours before a mass shooting in Lafayette *UPDATE*  Broward Sheriff Scott Israel stated that deputies arrived on the scene between  60 to 70 seconds  after the Fort Lauderdale shooting took place   quite an incredible response time by most law enforcement standards.TMZ acquired footage of the Fort Lauderdale shooter in action   the video appears to display elements of staging   decide for yourself According to reports,  Airport officials, along with federal and local authorities, are investigating who had access to the footage and who allowed it to be taped without authorization, Broward Mayor Barbara Sharief told the Sun Sentinel. *UPDATE* Just one week prior to the Fort Lauderdale shooting,  Florida lawmakers began rallying support for SB 140, a state bill that would repeal laws which, among other things, ban guns in airport terminals like the one where the shooting occurred.

23069,Washington Post Deceives Public & Profits From Fake News,"21st Century Wire says The Washington Post has been caught lying and deceiving the public twice in the last few weeks pushing the unfounded mainstream media meme that Russia invaded the U.S. electric grid and another claiming that Russia is behind the explosion of so-called  fake news. Considering that the power grid story was proven to be a fake news story that WashPost had to later retract  We have to consider the legitimacy of any further claims the outlet has against Russia as particularly dubious.The Intercept has some interesting analysis on how outlets such as WashPost not only deceive the public, push false state sponsored talking points but also how they profit financially from this collusion. Glenn Greenwald The InterceptIn the past six weeks, the Washington Post published two blockbuster stories about the Russian threat that went viral: one on how Russia is behind a massive explosion of  fake news,  the other on how it invaded the U.S. electric grid. Both articles were fundamentally false. Each now bears a humiliating editor s note grudgingly acknowledging that the core claims of the story were fiction: The first note was posted a full two weeks later to the top of the original article; the other was buried the following day at the bottom.The second story on the electric grid turned out to be far worse than I realized when I wrote about it on Saturday, when it became clear that there was no  penetration of the U.S. electricity grid  as the Post had claimed. In addition to the editor s note, the Russia-hacked-our-electric-grid story now has a full-scale retraction in the form of a separate article admitting that  the incident is not linked to any Russian government effort to target or hack the utility  and there may not even have been malware at all on this laptop.But while these debacles are embarrassing for the paper, they are also richly rewarding. That s because journalists   including those at the Post   aggressively hype and promote the original, sensationalistic false stories, ensuring that they go viral, generating massive traffic for the Post (the paper s executive editor, Marty Baron, recently boasted about how profitable the paper has become).After spreading the falsehoods far and wide, raising fear levels and manipulating U.S. political discourse in the process (both Russia stories were widely hyped on cable news), journalists who spread the false claims subsequently note the retraction or corrections only in the most muted way possible, and often not at all. As a result, only a tiny fraction of people who were exposed to the original false story end up learning of the retractions.Baron himself, editorial leader of the Post, is a perfect case study in this irresponsible tactic. It was Baron who went to Twitter on the evening of November 24 to announce the Post s expos  of the enormous reach of Russia s fake news operation, based on what he heralded as the findings of  independent researchers.  Baron s tweet went all over the place; to date, it has been re-tweeted more than 3,000 times, including by many journalists with their own large followings:Russian propaganda effort helped spread fake news during election, say independent researchers https://t.co/3ETVXWw16Q  Marty Baron (@PostBaron) November 25, 2016But after that story faced a barrage of intense criticism   from Adrian Chen in the New Yorker ( propaganda about Russia propaganda ), Matt Taibbi in Rolling Stone ( shameful, disgusting ), my own article, and many others   including legal threats from the sites smeared as Russian propaganda outlets by the Post s  independent researchers    the Post finally added its lengthy editor s note distancing itself from the anonymous group that provided the key claims of its story ( The Post   does not itself vouch for the validity of PropOrNot s findings  and  since publication of the Post s story, PropOrNot has removed some sites from its list ).What did Baron tell his followers about this editor s note that gutted the key claims of the story he hyped? Nothing. Not a word. To date, he has been publicly silent about these revisions. Having spread the original claims to tens of thousands of people, if not more, he took no steps to ensure that any of them heard about the major walk back on the article s most significant, inflammatory claims. He did, however, ironically find the time to promote a different Post story about how terrible and damaging Fake News is: Pizzagate  shows how fake news hurts real people https://t.co/cOh7RZ4RqK  Marty Baron (@PostBaron) November 26, 2016WHETHER THE POST S false stories here can be distinguished from what is commonly called  Fake News  is, at this point, a semantic dispute, particularly since  Fake News  has no cogent definition. Defenders of Fake News as a distinct category typically emphasize intent in order to differentiate it from bad journalism. That s really just a way of defining Fake News so as to make it definitionally impossible for mainstream media outlets like the Post ever to be guilty of it (much the way terrorism is defined to ensure that the U.S. government and its allies cannot, by definition, ever commit it).But what was the Post s motive in publishing two false stories about Russia that, very predictably, generated massive attention, traffic, and political impact? Was it ideological and political   namely, devotion to the D.C. agenda of elevating Russia into a grave threat to U.S. security? Was it to please its audience   knowing that its readers, in the wake of Trump s victory, want to be fed stories about Russian treachery? Was it access and source servitude   proving it will serve as a loyal and uncritical repository for any propaganda intelligence officials want disseminated? Was it profit   to generate revenue through sensationalistic click-bait headlines with a reckless disregard to whether its stories are true? In an institution as large as the Post, with numerous reporters and editors participating in these stories, it s impossible to identify any one motive as definitive.Whatever the motives, the effects of these false stories are exactly the same as those of whatever one regards as Fake News. The false claims travel all over the internet, deceiving huge numbers into believing them. The propagators of the falsehoods receive ample profit from their false, viral  news.  And there is no accountability of the kind that would disincentivize a repeat of the behavior. (That the Post ultimately corrects its false story does not distinguish it from classic Fake News sites, which also sometimes do the same.)And while it s true that all media outlets make mistakes, and that even the most careful journalism sometimes errs, those facts do not remotely mitigate the Post s behavior here. In these cases, they did not make good faith mistakes after engaging in careful journalism. With both stories, they were reckless (at best) from the start, and the glaring deficiencies in the reporting were immediately self-evident (which is why both stories were widely attacked upon publication).As this excellent timeline by Kalev Leetaru documents, the Post did not even bother to contact the utility companies in question   the most elementary step of journalistic responsibility   until after the story was published. Intelligence officials insisting on anonymity   so as to ensure no accountability   whispered to them that this happened, and despite how significant the consequences would be, they rushed to print it with no verification at all. This is not a case of good journalism producing inaccurate reporting; it is the case of a media outlet publishing a story that it knew would produce massive benefits and consequences without the slightest due diligence or care.THE MOST IRONIC aspect of all this is that it is mainstream journalists   the very people who have become obsessed with the crusade against Fake News   who play the key role in enabling and fueling this dissemination of false stories. They do so not only by uncritically spreading them, but also by taking little or no steps to notify the public of their falsity.The Post s epic debacle this weekend regarding its electric grid fiction vividly illustrates this dynamic. As I noted on Saturday, many journalists reacted to this story the same way they do every story about Russia: They instantly click and re-tweet and share the story without the slightest critical scrutiny. That these claims are constantly based on the whispers of anonymous officials and accompanied by no evidence whatsoever gives those journalists no pause at all; any official claim that Russia and Putin are behind some global evil is instantly treated as Truth. That s a significant reason papers like the Post are incentivized to recklessly publish stories of this kind. They know they will be praised and rewarded no matter the accuracy or reliability because their Cause   the agenda   is the right one.On Friday night, immediately after the Post s story was published, one of the most dramatic pronouncements came from the New York Times s editorial writer Brent Staples, who said this:Now that this story has collapsed and been fully retracted, what has Staples done to note that this tweet was false? Just like Baron, absolutely nothing Continue this article at The InterceptREAD MORE RUSSIAN HACK NEWS AT: 21WIRE Russian Hack Files",Middle-east,"January 7, 2017"
23070,"CONVENIENT? ‘Active Shooter’ Kills 5 in Fort Lauderdale, CNN Claims Voices in His Head ‘Told Him to Join ISIS’","21st Century Wire says Incredibly, on the same day that US  intelligence  officials were due to meet President-Elect Donald Trump about the alleged Russian Hack  report   like clockwork, another  Active Shooter  event springs-up, this time at Fort Lauderdale International Airport in Florida. Very dramatic, great television drama on CNN and elsewhere. As a result, no US news channel covered the epic flop of the CIA s report debacle and Trump s reaction to it until the evening news cycle.Stay tuned to 21WIRE later on, for a full Daily Shooter report on today s Fort Lauderdale Airport attack.Thus far, we re told that the suspect got off a Delta Flight from Anchorage, Alaska, calmly collected his bags, went into a bathroom, loaded his gun (which we re told was stored legally in his check-on luggage) and stepped into the baggage claim area and began shooting and killing people.And just when you thought this story couldn t get any more ridiculous, we re meant to swallow this Just now, CNN reported that suspect Esteban Santiago was a member of the National Guard, served in Iraq, and was hearing  ISIS voices  in his head. Anchor Erin Burnett stated on air: The shooter went into FBI office in Anchorage (Alaska) and told officials he was hearing voices in his head telling him to join ISIS! Indeed, exactly as 21WIRE predicted yesterday:CIA #russianhacking report out Monday. Our guess: there's nothing in it. What will Obama do as distraction? New hack? #ISIS attack?  21st Century Wire (@21WIRE) January 6, 2017As expected, CNN is pushing the  mental health  angle, with panel experts talking-up the need for more gun control and  mental health checks. Here s the official mainstream narrative  (CNN) Five people were shot dead and eight wounded in a baggage claim area at Fort Lauderdale s airport, and law enforcement sources tell CNN the suspect, identified as Esteban Santiago, had brought the firearm in his checked luggage.Authorities said it was too early to understand why the suspect, who was taken into custody without incident, opened fire at the Florida airport.Florida Sen. Bill Nelson told CNN that Santiago had a military identification card, but he did not know whether it was current.Here s the latest on what we know:  Thirteen people were shot and eight were taken to hospitals, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said. Five others died from their wounds.  The suspect joined the National Guard in Puerto Rico in 2007. In April 2010, he went to Iraq for 10 months. A spokeswoman for the Alaska Army National Guard said Santiago was in the Army Reserves before he joined the guard there in November 2014. Lt. Col. Candis Olmstead said Santiago was discharged in August for unsatisfactory performance.  The suspect showed up several months ago at the FBI office in Anchorage, law enforcement officials told CNN. He was interviewed and said he was hearing voices in his head, including some telling him to join ISIS. He was taken to a hospital for a mental health evaluation, voluntarily checked himself in, the officials explained.  Law enforcement sources told CNN that the suspect flew to Florida on Friday from Alaska and had declared the firearm. When he arrived at the airport, the suspect retrieved a bag at baggage claim, took out the gun and started firing, the sources said. One source said he went to the bathroom to get the gun out of his luggage and emerged firing.  Sheriff Israel said the gunman likely acted alone. The sheriff said it was too early to say whether terrorism was the motive.  Gov. Rick Scott told reporters at the airport:  The citizens of Florida will not tolerate senseless acts of evil. Whoever is responsible will held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.  The governor said that now was time to mourn the dead and pray for hospitalized victims, not talk about gun laws.  Multiple reports on social media   including tweets from former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer   described the shooting.Continue the mainstream story at CNNREAD MORE DAILY SHOOTER NEWS AT: 21WIRE Daily Shooter FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER@ 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"January 6, 2017"
23071,CIA Report Released: Trump maintains DNC Leaks had “Absolutely no effect on outcome of election”,"21st Century Wire says Despite the mass media distraction of the improbably  Active Shooter  attack at Fort Lauderdale Airport earlier this afternoon   today was  the big day,  the dramatic release of the  unclassified  portion the US Intelligence report of the alleged Russian Hack  of the 2016 US Election. Meanwhile, at Trump Tower, President-Elect Donald Trump was given the full classified version of the report today, and was unimpressed, declaring that the alleged hacking of the Democrat National Committee (DNC) had  absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election. Note that it is still an  alleged  hack because US intelligence agencies Have yet to produce any actual evidence that the Russian government were involved in either the DNC Leaks or the Podesta Email dump on Wikileaks.Instead, the report s main thrust is accusing the Russians of running all of the so-called  fake news  articles that flooded Facebook and social media during the 2016 election cycle   claiming that it all traces back to St. Petersburg, Russia   despite earlier investigative reports published by both The Guardian and Buzzfeed which placed the fake news empire in Macedonia, where teenagers netted small fortunes by pumping out imaginary stories on hundreds of cut-out websites during the 2016 election.  Putin Aspired to Help Trump CNN and other US media outlets were quick to  down-shift  their headlines   away from saying that the Russian government  Hacked  the US Elections, now saying that  Putin Aspired to Help Trump. After a 90-minute briefing at Trump Tower with national intelligence chiefs,  Donald Trump, under pressure from his party and the US media, issued a statement seeming to acknowledge some hacking of  the cyber-infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee,  but was clear to ad the caveat that whatever happened had  absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election. While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber-infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines. There were attempts to hack the Republican National Committee, but the R.N.C. had strong hacking defenses and the hackers were unsuccessful.

23072,CNN’s Don Lemon Tries to Downplay Horrific ‘Anti-Trump’ Torture of Mentally Disabled Man,"In case you missed it, CNN anchor Don Lemon went on a drunk, alcohol-fuelled tear this past New Years Eve, drinking tequila shots during CNN s nationally televised show. It was a shocking scene, even by CNN standards. After making a show of himself, the 50 year-old Lemon then got a free pass from CNN executives, and the next day he was back to work on set   as if nothing had happened. Things only got worse from there  On Wednesday, shocking reports surfaced of what appears to be both a politically and racially motivated attack, where four black youths from Chicago kidnapped and tortured a mentally disabled white man (pictured above), in an ordeal which lasted over 24 hours. The perpetrators live-streamed the abuse on Facebook s Live.Later that evening, host Don Lemon assembled a panel of CNN regulars, most of whom  appeared to downplay the political and racial nature of the attack  despite having the video evidence right there, clearly showing the captors  ill intentions.The kidnappers could be heard shouting at their victim, F*** Trump!  and  F*** white people!  as they proceeded to humiliate and torture the mentally disabled man, including taking a knife and  scalping a lock of his hair and drawing blood in the process.Aside from the political and racist overtones, the fact that the victim was a helpless disabled man added another dimension to the cruelty. The fact that this was a vulnerable person who was probably duped into going along with them. It appears it is someone who is mentally disabled, I think makes it even more sickening, said CNN guest Matt Lewis.  But at the end of the day, you just try to wrap your head around evil. That s what this is, it s evil. It s brutality. That s when CNN s Don Lemon stepped in, trying to steer the conversation towards being sympathetic towards the four black assailants, with Lemon stating,  I don t think it s evil. I think these are young people and I think they have bad home training.Lemon s obvious cognitive dissonance is clearly on display here, as the troubled anchor claims he cannot image such criminal behavior, even as four people conspire and broadcast the torture right in front of Lemon s eyes. I say, who is raising these young people? I have no idea who s raising these young people. Because no one I know on Earth who is 17 years old or 70 years old would ever think of treating another person like that. Watch Lemon s shameful gatekeeping episode here: Lemon s racial and political bias was trumped only by CNN s flippant black activist and Democratic Party surrogate, Symone Sanders, who tried selling the idea that this incident wasn t a  hate crime    even though all aspects of an anti-white racist hate were on full display. The Democratic Party worker then infers that Donald Trump is to blame for creating the conditions for the attack, as she callously tries to downplay the event as merely  stupid  on the part of the black kidnappers.One could easily argue based on their commentaries, both Don Lemon and Symone Sanders have a clear bias because of the racial identities of the assailants, and are thus incapable of covering this story with any level of normal objectivity.SEE ALSO: Don Lemon Hits Back at  Fake Information  That He s  Making Excuses  for Torture Gang Democratic Party operative and Black Lives Matter supporter Symone Sanders (Image: CNN)In a separate segment, #BlackLives Matter supporter and CNN panelist Angela Rye, attempted to divert the conversation away from the racist aspects of the crime by attacking The Blaze radio host Glenn Beck who tweeted earlier and blamed the militant activist George Soros-funded militant group Black Lives Matter for the incident.You are right.  Stand up with me and demand justice in Chicago for the beating of a disabled trump supporter by BLM https://t.co/aP79pKnHA1  Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) January 5, 2017It is not yet clear whether any of the four black assailants were members or supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement.Mainstream Media: Institutional Double Standards It goes without saying that had the racial identities been reversed in this case, then it would have sparked national outrage   and certainly organized rioting in dozens of cities across America   as well as any white-on-black crime being blamed on President-Elect Donald Trump.READ MORE CNN NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire CNN FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER@ 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"January 6, 2017"

23075,PROVOCATION? Republican Senators Introduce New Bill to Move US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem,"21st Century Wire says Donald Trump s campaign  promise  to move the US Embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem could trigger a series of events pushing the region back towards serious conflict. Trump s appointment of right-wing Jewish bankruptcy lawyer David Friedman (image, left) as his ambassador to Israel is seen by many as an aggressive move to promote an ultra-Zionist agenda, as Friedman is a supporter of illegal Israeli settlement expansion in Palestine.Moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem would be in direct violation of numerous other UN resolutions   11 UN Security Council resolutions have ruled that Israel s seizure of East Jerusalem is that of an occupied territory.Hussein Ibish of Foreign Policy Magazine outlines some of the context of this issue in terms of US politics: Among the many alarming ways in which President-elect Donald Trump might upend traditional American foreign policy, one of the most immediate and troubling concerns his pledge to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.Other successful presidential candidates, most notably Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, made the same promise, only, once inaugurated, to emulate all of their predecessors by invoking the executive waiver to the 1995 Congressional Mandate to relocate the embassy. According to Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official and peace negotiator, said that annexing settlements in the West Bank and moving the embassy to Jerusalem might mean the destruction of the peace process as a whole. Naturally, bellicose Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu denied it would inflame any conflict, stating in December that is was  great step forward to peace. Middle East advocate Camille Mansour, told Al-Monitor that the US move would be devastating to relations between Palestinians and Israel, stating: It is a clear abandonment of the corpus-separatum issue, which Jerusalem has enjoyed since before 1947,  he said. A number of consulates were based in Jerusalem   US, Italian, English, Turkish, Spanish, French and Belgian    based on this separate recognition of the city. NOTE:  Corpus-separatum  refers to Jerusalem s observed neutral legal and political status, closely related to that of an independent city-state.This comes on the heals of the recent controversy over the recent UN Security Council Resolution condemning Israeli settlements. Apparently, the UN also followed up the settlement resolution with a plan to track activities of companies doing business in the illegally occupied West Bank.Either way, this latest push by Republicans on behalf of Netanyahu and the Zionist Lobby seems to be a prelude to increased tensions in the Middle East  David Smith The GuardianThree Republican senators have introduced legislation to recognise Jerusalem as Israel s official capital and move the US embassy there from Tel Aviv, a plan backed by Donald Trump but likely to ignite fierce protests.After being sworn into the 115th Congress in Washington, Ted Cruz of Texas, Dean Heller of Nevada and Marco Rubio of Florida unveiled the Jerusalem Embassy and Recognition Act.Similar moves by Republican majorities over the past two decades have come to nought, but this time they have a sympathetic president-elect in Trump. He has repeatedly pledged to relocate the embassy to Jerusalem and nominated a US ambassador who shares that view.Critics warn that the move could unleash a wave of violence and further rattle the Israel-Palestine peace process and the future of a two-state solution.Cruz, runner-up to Trump in the Republican presidential primary, said on Tuesday:  Jerusalem is the eternal and undivided capital of Israel. Unfortunately, the Obama administration s vendetta against the Jewish state has been so vicious that to even utter this simple truth   let alone the reality that Jerusalem is the appropriate venue for the American embassy in Israel   is shocking in some circles.[ ] Rubio added:  Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish state of Israel, and that s where America s embassy belongs. It s time for Congress and the president-elect to eliminate the loophole that has allowed presidents in both parties to ignore US law and delay our embassy s rightful relocation to Jerusalem for over two decades. The US embassy has been located on Tel Aviv s HaYarkon Street for half a century. US state department policy has long held that the status of Jerusalem will only be determined in final talks between Israel and the Palestinians Continue this story at The GuardianREAD MORE ISRAEL NEWS AT: 21WIRE Israel FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER@ 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"January 4, 2017"
23076,SOUR GRAPES? Whatever happened to the ‘smooth transition of power’ that Obama vowed?," Andrew Malcolm McClatchy News You better stop stealing money from your mother s purse, young man, or I will punish you late this year or perhaps sometime in 2018,  said no parent who was serious about punishment.Yet that s pretty much what President Obama did with his old-fashioned expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats over alleged political hacking by Moscow interests going back 18 months.A very strange retro-response from a president who mocked Mitt Romney for suggesting in 2012 that Russia was America s worst strategic threat. Obama said:  The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War s been over for 20 years. As has often happened when Obama shoots from the lip sans teleprompter (think his red line in Syria, ISIS is a JV squad), the aloof one is wrong.Obama s been golfing and snorkeling in Hawaii since mid-December. But he left orders for a number of last-minute steps, including more ineffective sanctions against Russia and a stunning historic break with Israel. Indeed, these measures smell more of vengeance than practical policy.Petty political ploys are standard operating procedure back in the Chicago wards that spawned Obama s career. They re less expected at the presidential level.

23077,HACKING DEMOCRACY? CIA Accusing Russia of Doing What Langley Does So Well,"Peter Certo Other WordsEven in an election year as shot through with conspiracy theories as this one, it would have been hard to imagine a bigger bombshell than Russia intervening to help Donald Trump. But that s exactly what the CIA believes happened, or so unnamed  officials brief on the matter  told the Washington Post.While Russia had long been blamed for hacking email accounts linked to the Clinton campaign, its motives had been shrouded in mystery. According to the Post, though, CIA officials recently presented Congress with a  a growing body of intelligence from multiple sources  that  electing Trump was Russia s goal. Now, the CIA hasn t made any of its evidence public, and the CIA and FBI are reportedly divided on the subject. Though it s too soon to draw conclusions, the charges warrant a serious public investigation.Even some Republicans who backed Trump seem to agree.  The Russians are not our friends,  said Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, announcing his support for a congressional probe. It s  warfare,  added Senator John McCain.There s a grim irony to this. The CIA is accusing Russia of interfering in our free and fair elections to install a right-wing candidate it deemed more favorable to its interests. Yet during the Cold War, that s exactly what the CIA did to the rest of the world.Most Americans probably don t know that history. But in much of the world it s a crucial part of how Washington is viewed even today.In the post-World War II years, as Moscow and Washington jockeyed for global influence, the two capitals tried to game every foreign election they could get their hands on.From Europe to Vietnam and Chile to the Philippines, American agents delivered briefcases of cash to hand-picked politicians, launched smear campaigns against their left-leaning rivals, and spread hysterical  fake news  stories like the ones some now accuse Russia of spreading here.Together, political scientist Dov Levin estimates, Russia and the U.S. interfered in 117 elections this way in the second half the 20th century. Even worse is what happened when the CIA s chosen candidates lost.In Iran, when elected leader Mohammad Mossadegh tried to nationalize the country s BP-held oil reserves, CIA agent Kermit Roosevelt led an operation to oust Mossadegh in favor of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The shah s secret police tortured dissidents by the thousands, leading directly to the Islamic Revolution in 1979.In Guatemala, when the democratically elected Jacobo Arbez tried to loosen the U.S.-based United Fruit company s grip on Guatemalan land, the CIA backed a coup against him. In the decades of civil war that followed, U.S.-backed security forces were accused of carrying out a genocide against indigenous Guatemalans. Chile s democratically elected leader Allende was murdered in a brutal CIA coup d etat on September 11, 1973 (Image Source: Evergreen.edu)In Chile, after voters elected the socialist Salvador Allende, the CIA spearheaded a bloody coup to install the right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, who went on to torture and disappear tens of thousands of Chileans. I don t see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its own people,  U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger purportedly said about the coup he helped orchestrate there.And those are only the most well-known examples Continue this article at Other WordsREAD MORE MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21WIRE 2016 FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER@ 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"January 3, 2017"
23078,Good News for Silver in 2017," James Burgess Oil PricePrecious metals are an important component of every investor s portfolio, and while gold often gets all the hype, another precious metal will be a much better bet in 2017: Silver.The market for silver continues to tighten as supply has failed to keep up with demand for much of the past decade. Silver is used in all facets of modern life, including electronics, medical devices, engines, batteries, solar panels, LED lighting, semiconductors, touch screens, dentistry, and nuclear reactors. The list goes on.Demand for silver is up by more than 35 percent since 2009, while supply only grew by a little more than 10 percent. In 2015 alone, global demand for silver exceeded supply by roughly 129 million ounces, or about 11 percent of overall demand. With silver consumption set to expand indefinitely, the supply deficit will continue to put upward pressure on prices in the years ahead.The set-up here is fantastic because indications are that we are on the edge of another bull run at a time when silver mining stocks are significantly undervalued. Silver prices had a good run for most of 2016, but have fallen back in recent weeks as the dollar has strengthened and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election abated. But the pause in the run up in prices will be brief, offering investors an appetizing entry point for a crucial commodity in today s globalized economy.Silver may be down 10% from its peak of $20.67 in Q3, but the sell-offs were based on sentiment, not fundamental reality and this is exactly where smart investment finds opportunity. The strongest documented indication of this is the Q3 earnings of silver miners, which only the savviest of investors are picking up on. Pan American Silver (NASDAQ:PAAS) reported Q3 earnings of an impressive US$43.4 million up US$9.2 million over the previous quarter just for starters.[ ]1. The Global Silver Lining: A Precious Metal PremiumGlobal investors are magnetically drawn to precious metals in times of uncertainty and instability.

On New Year s Eve, one of CNN s highly paid anchors, Don Lemon could be seen on national TV in New Orleans with co-presenter Brooke Baldwin, as Lemon proceeded to pound shots of tequila live on air, slurring his speech and shouting, while simultaneously getting his ear pierced during the program. Lemon then went on to sink into a melancholy diatribe about not being in a relationship (Lemon is gay) and personal struggles with his own narcissism.The episode prompted many critics to question his psychological state, and also to ask whether or not Lemon might have a serious drinking or substance problem.Things got so bad that network producers had to pull the audio feed while drunk Lemon began shouting  2016 was awful. On the New York City feed, onlookers from CNN were obscure female American comedian, Kathy Griffin, joined by  news presenter  and actor Anderson Cooper, both of whom were enjoying the spectacle   not at all concerned with the potential damage to Lemon s reputation as a result of his alcoholic episode on air.Griffin could be seen shouting,  Nipples!

23081,US Middle Class Still Suffering from Rockefeller-Kissinger Industrial Transfer Scheme to China," Dick Eastman The Truth HoundWhen Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller met with Zhou Enlai in China in 1973 just after President Richard Nixon had visited China establishing official relations an understanding was reached whereby the U.S. would supply industrial capital and know-how to China.In return Kissinger-connected corporations would gain the monopolistic advantage of low-cost labor production which could outcompete all U.S. domestic industry.The comparative advantage gained was being able to hire Chinese laborers who were ready to work hard at exceedingly low cost with no drugs, no alcohol, a strong work ethic, no unions, no paid benefits and weak environmental standards. And with such a large labor pool, burned out workers could simply be replaced. This gave the Rockefeller/Kissinger corporations a major edge over their domestic U.S. competitors who had to pay relatively high wages, high regulation costs, deal with union strikes and collective bargaining etc.Of course, the American consumer did not see greatly lowered prices commensurate with such greatly lowered labor costs. The $19.99 plastic action-figure toy marketed with a Hollywood movie still cost $19.99 even though it cost $12 to $15 to produce in the U.S. but less than $2.00 per copy to produce in China and transport to America s West Coast container ports for distribution throughout America.The consumer paid pretty much the old prices but the corporations split the monopoly profit with China s Princelings since it did not take much of a lowering of prices to drive high-wage, high-benefit, contracted-labor domestic corporations out of business (not to mention the environmental and workplace safety regulations with which domestic companies were saddled).  Then, Wal-Mart became a near-monopoly retailer that increased and reinforced the widespread selling of these off-shore manufactures.Thus, America s domestic producers were not simply being bested on one or another area of production; they were being bested across the entire spectrum of manufactured goods that American buy. It was anticipated that these domestic firms would fail, and their failure was hastened by the banks maintaining a deflationary domestic economy in the U.S. throughout the post Rockefeller-Kissinger-Zhou buildup of China and the degrading of American domestic manufacturing.Remember, the entire money supply of the U.S. is borrowed that is, the money co-created with a debt of an even bigger amount (principal plus compound interest) that must in due course be returned to the lender. But money in the domestic economy was going to multinational corporations and to China, while also going to taxes to pay on the national debt that resulted [NOTE: Due to U.S. industrial depletion, federal revenue receipts as well as the tax-take of state and local governments, shrunk, resulting in greater government borrowing and therefore greater public debts TRUTH HOUND note].  And of course, compound interest was attached to that debt.Rockefeller and Kissinger were (and to some extent still are) at war with middle-class America with intelligent, self-supporting, self-respecting, ambitious, industrious citizens who always pose the greatest threat in the form of populist politics to the bankers and their Bank-of-England/East-India-Company/Rothschild monetary and trade system, the very system that Rockefeller and Kissinger were representing and expanding when they visited Zhou Enlai.So here we are in 2016 and newly elected President Donald J. Trump says he intends to place a tariff on goods imported from China, while the media decries the tariff proposal as a violation of  long-standing liberal free-trade policies. One more thing in defense of who I believe was a great president and a warning for the new one.Richard Nixon opened China believing in peaceful co-existence and the fact that if given time for a fair comparison of how free-enterprise and representative government functions in contrast to the communist planned economy, that the U.S. model would win out over a system where each receives what the state deems he needs and where work is ordered by the state.But of course Kissinger and Rockefeller instigated the Watergate coup against Nixon a frame-up with John Dean and Kissinger as the real  Deep Throats  by my deductions from public information so that the Rockefeller/Kissinger plans for China s industrialization and America s deindustrialization could proceed unopposed, as it certainly did after Nixon resigned to avoid a constitutional crisis that would hinder the proper working of government.Nixon should have fought them because they were about to take a financial axe to this country as soon as Nixon was gone.  When Nixon was gone, they first robbed the middle-class of their savings with banker Paul Volcker s  QE  (quantitative easing) bond purchases at the New York Federal Reserve branch. Then, when that was accomplished, America s savings-and-loans were cast into crisis (because they had been taking in money short-term at 3% and lending long-term at 6%). This helped force the deregulation of banking to Rockefeller advantage after which Volcker moved to become Federal Reserve Chairman in control of the discount rate. With that lever of power that sets the interest-rate framework of the nation, Volcker inaugurated the tight-money (deflation) policy that has persisted to this day, making it very hard for firms to invest in automation to combat the cost advantage of Chinese subsistence labor.Japan was hit with deflation too   they were going to provide us with the robots.  THE WHOLE THING WAS A GREAT PLAN AGAINST US, COORDINATED AT EVERY LEVEL, WITH EVERY INSTITUTION, FROM THE NEWS TALKING ABOUT HOW THE LEVERAGED BUY-OUTS OCCURING IN THE DEFLATION WERE MAKING US  LEAN AND MEAN,  WHEN IN FACT THEY WERE TEARING OUT THE GUTS OF AMERICAN PRODUCTION.  And the news media and the economics and business administration courses in colleges sung the praises of international free trade and the  efficiency of markets  nonstop.I watched it all from a pretty good seat on the sidelines, but of course I was marginalized as just another excess white person who needed to stand aside so that blacks and women could have their fair chance.  And who could argue with that?  So I took to the internet to see what effect I could have simply speaking as a citizen, where I ve met encountered considerable abuse and ridicule, which certainly makes it unpleasant to try and be the  Paul Revere  awakening the good citizens.I do wish President Donald Trump the best. But let us make sure that none of the neo-conservatives he is taking into his administration are really  Kissingers  beholden to Goldman-Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein.

23082,PC TYRANNY: University of Oregon Rules That Professors Have NO Free Speech,"21st Century Wire says By cow-towing to students  over-sensitivity to free speech and seemingly a prenatal requirement for  safe spaces  on campus   academics and university administrators are unknowingly (or knowingly) constructing communitarian unintellectual institutions of tyranny on campuses across America. The end result of this progress  should be obvious to anyone who has studied 20th century history   it is anarchy. If students are allowed to get professors suspended or fired over spurious allegations of  offense caused,  or rather, causing students to feel  uncomfortable    then the entire concept of the university as we once knew it   is finished. By dismissing talent in favor of adherence to an ever new and constantly updated  orthdoxy,  the only professors left to teach in this burgeoning environment of weaponized political correctness will most certainly be under-qualified, mediocre, young, and possibly radical or overly militant instructors.That will be the end of higher education   and as we can now see, it s heading in that direction  (Image Source: Niskan Center)Mark Tapson Truth RevoltWriting for the Washington Post, Eugene Volokh of The Volokh Conspiracy addresses a disturbing development at the University of Oregon, whose administration made clear to its faculty last week that if you say things about race, sexual orientation, sex, religion and so on that enough people find offensive, you could get suspended and possibly even fired. This can happen even to tenured faculty members or to anyone else.  Orthodoxy,  Volokh writes,  enforced on threat of institutional punishment, is what the University of Oregon is now about. This all began with a Halloween party hosted by tenured University of Oregon law school professor Nancy Shurtz attended by about a dozen students and about a dozen nonstudents:Shurtz had told the students that she would be  going as a popular book title ; she didn t tell the students up front what it was, but the book was the recent (and acclaimed)  Black Man in a White Coat,  a black doctor s  reflections on race and medicine  (according to the subtitle). Shurtz s  costume incorporated a white doctor s lab coat, a stethoscope, black makeup on her face and hands, and a black curly wig resembling an afro.  The university report states that Shurtz  was inspired by this book and by the author, that she greatly admires [the author] and wanted to honor him, and that she dressed as the book because she finds it reprehensible that there is a shortage of racial diversity, and particularly of black men, in higher education. [ ] And this perceived offensiveness yielded a huge uproar at the law school. According to the report, the uproar was partly students  immediate reaction and partly a result of the administration s and other faculty members  discussing the matter extensively at school, including in classes.[ ] So we have speech, at a professor s home, but at a party to which she had invited her students, which in turn leads to speech by various people at the law school. (There s no doubt that wearing an expressive costume is treated as equivalent to speech under First Amendment  symbolic expression  purposes.) Some of both kinds of speech are interpreted as expressing offensive messages related to race. What does the university do about this?The university suspended Shurtz.It then released a report concluding that Shurtz s speech constituted  harassment,  which violates university policy. The harassment policy, the university report notes, bans conduct that creates a  hostile environment  based on  age, race, color, ancestry, national or ethnic origin, religion, service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, marital or family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, physical or mental disability, gender, perceived gender, gender identity, genetic information or the use of leave protected by state or federal law. Under the logic of the Oregon report, Volokh notes,  a faculty member could be disciplined for displaying the Mohammed cartoons, if it caused enough of a furor.

23085,Gingrich: Trump Will Repeal 60-70% of Obama’s Executive Orders,"21st Century Wire says In a recent interview former House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, told Fox that Trump will likely be vetoing out the majority of executive orders made by Obama.If we examine the mountain of executive orders that were penned under the Obama administration, we must wonder if Gingrich isn t making a good point and an accurate assessment about President Elect Trump s intentions with regards to his promise to  drain the swamp.  Obama had very little luck getting many of the draconian, unconstitutional policies his administration wanted to see enacted approved by Congress so he leaned heavily on Executive Orders to push policies and conflicts that would not have been approved by Congress otherwise.Perhaps this will be one of the early indicators of how serious Trump is about rolling back policies that have proven to be detrimental to Americans  RTUS President-elect Donald Trump may reverse up to 70 percent of President Barack Obama s executive orders, practically erasing the legacy of the first African-American head of state, Former House speaker Newt Gingrich told Fox. I think in the opening couple days, he s going to repeal 60 to 70 percent of Obama s legacy by simply vetoing out all of the various executive orders that Obama used because he couldn t get anything through Congress,  Gingrich said in an interview with  Sunday Morning Futures  on Fox Business..@newtgingrich:""[@realDonaldTrump's] going to repeal 60 or 70% of Obama's legacy by simply vetoing out all of the various executive orders."" pic.twitter.com/VCbxdUofbV  SundayMorningFutures (@SundayFutures) December 25, 2016Obama, who signed over 260 executive orders in his two terms in office, urged Trump, who will be inaugurated on January 20, not to circumvent Congress when trying to enact his agenda. Obama used his executive powers to push through labor, climate and immigration reforms after Congress refused to go along with his proposed programs.READ MORE:  US refusal to veto UN Israeli resolution symbolic gesture by lame duck Obama My suggestion to the president elect is, you know, going through the legislative process is always better, in part because it s harder to undo,  Obama told NPR last week.  In my first two years, I wasn t relying on executive powers because I had big majorities in   Congress and we   [were] able to get bills passed. Even after we lost the majorities in Congress, I bent over backward consistently to try to find compromise and a legislative solution to some of the big problems that we ve got. READ MORE:  We are rooting for his success : Obama on Trump victory as he urges smooth transitionObama noted that Trump is  entirely within his lawful power  to sign new executive orders and  if he wants to reverse some of those rules, that s part of the Democratic process. Gingrich believes that by exercising such power Trump will just sign Obama s legacy away. I think President Obama is beginning to figure out that his legacy is like one of those dolls that as the air comes out of it, it shrinks and shrinks and shrinks,  Gingrich said.During the election campaign Trump did promise to repeal Obama s initiatives, telling his voters in North Carolina in September that his administration would  eliminate every unconstitutional executive order and restore the rule of law to our land. That promise now seems a reality especially after Obama failed to honor his promise of a  smooth  transition to Trump after his victory. The rift between the future administration and Obama s office became apparent on Friday when the US abstained from voting at the UN Security Council, allowing an anti-Israeli settlement resolution to pass, despite a strong calls for Trump to  veto  the document. He [President Obama] is in this desperate frenzy. What he s actually doing is he s setting up a series of things to distract Trump, which will make his liberal allies feel good about Democrats and hate Republicans when Trump rolls them back,  Gingrich noted Continue this story at RTREAD MORE MSM LIES AT: 21st Century Wire MSM Files",Middle-east,"December 28, 2016"
23086,MEDIA TRIPWIRE? Ping Pong Pizza Conspiracy Propels Internet Censorship Amid ‘Fake News’ Witch-Hunt," Funny how secrets travel. I d start to believe, if I were to bleed.    Lyrics written by David Bowie from the album OutsideShawn Helton 21st Century Wire In the days before the US presidential election in November 2016, Wikileaks revealed a new string of emails connected to Hillary Clinton s 2016 campaign chairman, John Podesta. Online interpretations of the leaked Podesta email exchanges subsequently led to a digital firestorm on social media, producing an intense conspiratorial  open source investigation  still in search of its smoking gun. However, the phenomenon now known by its hashtag #Pizzagate has since set a number of tertiary events into motion. Is there a real story hidden amongst the debris of this online explosion?Is it possible that  open source investigators  were being led into a virtual cul-de-sac and thus missing the real story?More importantly, could people be playing into the hands of the very establishment they seek to depose?Let s investigate   SHOCK & AWE    Over the past month, the DC-based restaurant Comet Ping Pong, along with Besta Pizza (to a lesser degree Austin s East Side Pies) has been the subject of a peculiar internet-based conspiracy. (Photo Illustration Shawn Helton of 21WIRE)CONTEXT: Podesta Emails, False Hacks & ConspiracyWhile many of the leaked Podesta emails (including the really important one admitting that US partners Qatar and Saudi Arabia are giving funding and  logistical support  of ISIS) caused a major stir in the run-up to the 2016 Election, few Wikileaks releases have attracted more attention then the Podesta emails associated with the internet-based conspiracy dubbed  Pizzagate. In fact, since the release of the so-called  pizzagate  emails, a bundle of leaks and media reports associated with the Clintons political pay-for-play allegations, as well as the shocking admission regarding voter fraud from disgraced Democratic National committee consultant Robert Creamer prior to the 2016 presidential election, have all but disappeared from the mainstream narrative. Very convenient, if you are part of the Democratic Party establishment.Remember that all of this was taking place right after the mainstream media along with the White House, set the stage for a massive PR push implicating Russia as a disrupting force for evil in the US presidential election   allegedly through Kremlin-sponsored hacking of US democratic institutions and through  sophisticated Russian propaganda. In August, the western media s claims against Russia hit overdrive, when the  New York Times s Moscow bureau was the target of an attempted cyber attack this month. But so far, there is no evidence that the hackers, believed to be Russian, were successful. Flash forward to September here and here, as well as early October in the lead up to President Obama s Russian Hack decree, the Clinton-friendly outlet, the NY Times, had all but solidified the Russian cyber-hack claims   but once again, without any definitive evidence or proof.Throw in another American  October surprise  in the form distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, renewed calls for the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) internet, led to so-called cyber experts blaming the largest  hack on America  because of the inability to pass SOPA   in effect, reigniting the previously stalled SOPA in Washington DC, along with all of its draconian copyright law positions   all perfectly timed as mainstream reports regarding  fake news suddenly became all the rage across all forms of media.The media clips on YouTube below illustrate the kind of duplicitous double speak regarding the  election rigging  that has become a hallmark of the Obama administration and establishment Washington Following 2016 s US presidential election cycle, a Russian election-hack-theory gained even more media traction, orbiting the political realm like a low-hanging fruit (propelled by President Obama and now the CIA, both conflicting with the FBI s assessment in October), dovetailing with the first grumblings that  fake news  had somehow decided the US presidential election in favor of one candidate, Donald Trump. These are serious accusations that have still failed to yield any solid forensic results from the intelligence community.Is this mere political gamesmanship, or is there more at work?Could this all be covering up and diverting the public away from some other explosive events?  LOLITA EXPRESS    In 2008, Jeffery Epstein was convicted of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution (Image Source: miamibeachadvocate.com)As internet researches battle with mainstream media over allegations in #Pizzagate, another potentially much bigger story became buried under the digital avalanche. If this is indeed the case, then who benefits?The  Lolita Express  ScandalSeemingly even more unsettling and disturbing in 2016, was the vastly underreported  Lolita Express  scandal swirling around the Clinton Campaign.In 2010, Jeffery Epstein, a billionaire hedge fund mogul who is also a member of the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations (as well as playing a role in the formation of the Clinton Global Initiative), effectively walked free even though a 53-page indictment could have landed him in prison for 20 years according to reports. Epstein s  Gatsbyesque  persona once described by New York magazine, has long since given way to a new profile as a convicted sex-offender  a superstar who was now condemned by a litany of legal troubles due to reports of ghastly serial abuse during the past decade.However, during this year s election cycle, coverage concerning new details associated with Epstein s private island, Little St. James, and allegations of sex slave entertainment enterprise there, was virtually buried by the US corporate media.The drop in wall-to-wall coverage from the tongue-tied mainstream media was most likely due to Epstein s close affiliation to former President Bill Clinton, who according flight manifests and other supporting evidence, took  at least 26 trips aboard the  Lolita Express    even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com. It doesn t stop there either. Other high-profile names linked to the Epstein case included former Democratic governor Bill Richardson, Kurt Cobain widow Courtney Love, prominent celebrity lawyer, Israeli advocate and Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, British royal Prince Andrew, former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, and even president-elect Donald Trump.  THE BLACK BOOK     Epstein flight records and  a little black book  paint a very intriguing picture. (Image Source: Gawker)Interestingly, the Epstein case was covered heavily by Gawker   a news outlets which is now facing bankruptcy following a defamation case won by Hulk Hogan (Terrence Gene Bollea) over the controversial publication of the wrestling icon s sex tape. Hogan s legal victory  took Gawker out  but could the real reason have been its Epstein coverage? Here s some of what Gawker said about the Epstein case: Donald Trump, Courtney Love, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, and uber-lawyer Alan Dershowitz may have been identified by a butler as potential  material witnesses  to pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein s crimes against young girls, according to a copy of Epstein s little black book obtained by Gawker.An annotated copy of the address book, which also contains entries for Alec Baldwin, Ralph Fiennes, Griffin Dunne, New York Post gossip Richard Johnson, Ted Kennedy, David Koch, filmmaker Andrew Jarecki, and all manner of other people you might expect a billionaire to know, turned up in court proceedings after Epstein s former house manager Alfredo Rodriguez tried to sell it in 2009. About 50 of the entries, including those of many of Epstein s suspected victims and accomplices as well as Trump, Love, Barak, Dershowitz, and others, were circled by Rodriguez. (The existence of the book has been previously reported by the Daily Mail. Gawker is publishing it in full here for the first time; we have redacted addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, and the last names of individuals who may have been underage victims.)According to an FBI affidavit, Rodriguez described the address book and the information contained within it as the  Holy Grail  or  Golden Nugget  to unraveling Epstein s sprawling child-sex network. Epstein reportedly also had additional ties to Trump, with both men having on and off again been implicated in a separate Jane Doe  sexual assault lawsuit that was recently dropped in the US court system, apparently for a third time since 1994.The Washington Times discusses how other high-level clients allegedly used Epstein s services   including a member of the British royal family. The following passage is from a report filed in January of 2015: And even post-prison, Mr. Epstein kept up some of these high-profile relationships   leading to his most recent emergence in the news, which involves allegations that he provided Prince Andrew with sexual services from a then-17-year-old American girl, Virginia Roberts.Ms. Roberts, now 30, has filed a federal lawsuit in Florida against Mr. Epstein, alleging he forced her to serve as a  sex slave  and paid her $15,000 to perform sexual services for the prince, the New York Post reported. Here s Sean Stone from RT s Watching the Hawks interviewing Conchita Sarnoff, the Executive Director from The Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking to discuss Epstein s heinous past Another strange turn in the Clinton Email scandal came late in the election, only days before voters went to the polls. Suddenly, it was revealed by media outlets that due to the investigation into the sexting scandal involving disgraced former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner, (husband of chief Clinton aide Huma Abedine) FBI director James Comey would announce that the agency would be reopening the Clinton email probe.Interestingly, according to a recent interview with Breitbart News, Hillary Clinton herself was alleged to have taken 6 trips to Epstein s Little Saint James island, according to private security kingpin and Blackwater founder Erik Prince. Prior to the election and right after the FBI reopened its investigation into the Clintons (before promptly being shut down for a second time), the controversial mercenary made the extraordinary claim.It s important for readers to note how explosive this revelation truly was, and yet, not one word from either the mainstream media, or  alternative media,  outside of Breitbart and few other blogs, on this potentially devastating allegation. Prince asserted that the NYPD found  way more stuff  within the 650,000 recently scrutinized emails. The news reportedly sent shock waves into the upper echelon of the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign   as the NYPD was said to have been ready to hand out indictments  into additional criminal activity, possibly involving money laundering and underage sex, among other illicit activity.Prince s commentary on the Democratic Party s apparent corruption was released around the same time as a batch of Podesta Emails that sent internet sleuths down a pizzagate rabbit hole. Prince s claim then seem to be grafted onto the pizzagate theory by some YouTube commentators, only without any actual concrete evidence.In early 2016, the embattled Blackwater (renamed Academi, and then Xe) founder Prince, was the subject of an inquiry that alleged he was involved in a major money laundering scheme with the Bank of China in Libya. In 2014, Prince supposedly setup  Frontier Services Group in 2014 with the help of major Chinese investment firm Citic Group. When you factor in how Prince himself became the subject of a major scandal and is now on the offensive, it s hard to know whether his claims are true or just a political ploy aimed at deflecting his own controversy. However, his claims do offer a dark view into a political party that has been in a downward spiral for several years.Wheat from the ChaffWith all of that in mind, for any true investigation to take place, the facts still need to be separated from what might only be innuendo and overt speculation.Other apparent conspiracies were also brought into the fold during the ascendency of #pizzagate, as social media users seemed to make some startling connections, although without a complete story. The lack of coherence of pizzagate allegations opened the door for some of the usual suspects to come in to steer the conversation away from some potentially damaging connections back to the Clintons. Establishment gatekeeper publication The Daily Beast reported the following in the passage below: Written by user  PleadingtheYiff,  the post attempts to link the Clinton campaign to Laura Silsby, an Idaho missionary who served a six-month prison sentence in Haiti after the organization she founded, New Life Children s Refuge, attempted to transport 33 Haitian children to the Dominican Republic after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.The user s primary proof of links between the Clintons and Silsby:  Huma Abedin was constantly forwarding Hillary articles on this woman s organization.  The post provides no email sent from Clinton to Abedin regarding the incident.The theory then includes a major error. One of the first things Hillary did when she took over the scene in Haiti was to get Laura off the hook,  PleadingtheYiff writes, then links to a website called  AboveTopSecret.com. Silsby wasn t freed and instead remained incarcerated in Haiti, where she faced trial and was found guilty. The nine other missionaries jailed alongside her were freed. Is it possible that the Laura Silsby case was buried under endless collateral damage from pizzagate?With even more damning American conspiracies in 2016, such as the DNC fraud, violent protests funded by George Soros, or the Pentagon paying PR firm Bell Pottinger $540 million to produce fake terror videos, in addition to the Lolita Express revelations concerning the Clintons in particular, you have to wonder whether the pizzagate theory was an unintended coincidence or if it was yet another socially engineered agenda that masked other media stories.What s most obvious, however, is how the pizzagate story and spin-off controversies appear to have obfuscated other real criminality contained within the Podesta email leaks, while providing a media smoke screen for the conspiracies mentioned directly above.In the article below we ll take another look at the pizzagate phenomena (along with Comet Ping Pong s gunman story, in addition to one of Washington DC s most notorious scandals) and how the events surrounding the online conspiracy, could be used to shape new censorship protocols in the wake of US media s witch-hunt for  fake news  sites   LEAKED    John Podesta former chairman for Hillary Clinton s 2016 presidential campaign, pictured with Clinton chief aid Huma Abedin on the Clinton campaign jet. Spirit Cooking & #Pizzagate: A Media-Driven Psy-Op?Within the contents of the controversial Podesta dispatch by Wikileaks in early November, there appeared to be a distressing email chain between Tony Podesta, a top Democratic lobbyist of the Podesta Group (brother of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman) and a New York City-based Serbian performance artist named Marina Abramovic.The 2015 email exchange between Tony Podesta and Marina Abramovic (image, left) drew a sharp outcry from users on social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit, after the email conversation revealed a dinner party involving a performance art-based ritual calling for the use of real human blood and bodily fluids, referred to as  spirit cooking.   While Abramovic s occult-influenced art could be seen as sick and deeply disturbing to many, and even degenerate depravity to some   it s important to emphasize there was nothing criminal about her email with Tony Podesta or her dark creations captured on video from as early as two decades ago.The origins of Abramovic s spirit cooking appeared to some researchers to be linked directly to Aleister Crowley s, Thelma religion. This prompted some alternative media outlets to link to Everpedia as their primary source to explain the  truth  behind spirit cooking. The internet-based conspiracy ultimately led to increased speculation, turbo-charging even more spurious connections.Another major magnet for pizzagate researchers was Abramovic s book published in 1997, the self-proclaimed  grandmother  of performance art released a book entitled  Spirit Cooking with essential aphrodisiac recipes,   a rare book that contained a sequence of etchings and perverted recipes.As theories about spirit cooking exploded on social media, a series of Podesta emails were leaked containing what had been thought to be coded language concealing an elite underground child sex ring, according some quasi-investigative online sites and mega forums, citing 4chan and Reddit posts.In addition, it appears that a series of emails released by Wikileaks, here and here, are partially what led to one man, James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong, to become the central pizzagate antagonist. The fact that Alefantis is listed as one of DC s top 50 most influential people   only fuelled speculation that the internet case was  a slam dunk. Social media inquisitors shared pictures from the Instagram account of Alefantis (now blocked to the public) and other friends and contacts linked with him, in an attempt to conclude a vast conspiracy. While many of these images appeared disturbing in the context of the two conspiracies mentioned above, the images themselves did not prove any actual crime had taken place.As the conspiracy deepened, symbols from the Washington DC restaurant/venue Comet Ping Pong (derived from its menu and logo, as well as other pizza restaurants), in addition to apparent coded Podesta emails, sparked an outcry on social media as the symbols used appeared to mimic those according to a Wikileaks release supposedly from the FBI. The apparent leaked release from the FBI disclosed certain markers in sex trafficking and abuse cases. While there might be similarities in the graphics observed at Comet Ping Pong and nearby Besta Pizza, the evidence is still purely circumstantial and certainly nothing conclusively linking the DC-based pizzerias to any abuse ring. Internet trawlers also claimed to have unearthed photos of the digging of a secret basement-dungeon underneath Comet Ping Pong   a claim which later turned out to be false.Note that this one planted detail in the pizzagate story   the evocative image a  secret basement  reserved for child torture and abuse   sent this story into orbit. This is one example of how one or two simple details injected into a storyline can inflame the narrative and motivate forum users beyond what any real forensic investigation could, by creating a virtual crusade.In fact, it was revealed that  Comet uses a low-slung refrigerator at Buck s Fishing & Camping, Mr. Alefantis s other restaurant two doors down on the same block, to store produce, cheese and proofing dough.   (See left photo by Cecilia Kang)It s worth noting that 4chan was also behind one of the most speculative claims surrounding MH370, a story that allegedly involved the patent holders of the tech company Freescale Semiconductor which turned out to be false. Conversely, 4chan has provided some valuable crowd-sourced information, like in the wake of the 2013 Boston Bombing when 4chan users posted a number of photos indicating the presence of other operatives involved in the event   a point totally blacked-out by US authorities and media.Interestingly, the 4chan website is said to be  struggling to survive  financially in part because of increased users driven by viral and clickbait-like material like pizzagate.Through hyper-speculative and often misleading information spread by social media users, the pizzagate narrative took shape Media TripwireAs the US media brushed off the perceived content of the Podesta emails mentioned above, a ground swell of speculation, hyperbole and unsubstantiated claims filled the vacuum online, as enthusiasm continued unabated.It s also important to recognize that one of the main propellers of the initial Pizzagate story was a popular disinformation website called Your News Wire, who regularly feed the public with completely fake news stories online which get propagated through social media. This website has successfully managed to fool many online readers because it will regularly mix real news articles in with its many invented stories. A viral fake story like this would have netted  Your News Wire  tens of thousands of dollars in ad click revenue.BuzzFeed reports: On Oct. 30, a white supremacy Twitter account that presents itself as belonging to a Jewish lawyer in New York tweeted that the NYPD was looking into evidence that emails from Anthony Weiner s laptop contained evidence of Clinton involvement in an  international child enslavement ring. The next day, Oct. 31, Sean Adl-Tabatabai, who used to work with British conspiracy theorist David Icke, took note of the message board post and the tweet. He wrote a post for his site, YourNewsWire.com. His story took another step by claiming an  FBI insider  had confirmed the claims. Where did this this new FBI source come from? Adl-Tabatabai cited a thread on a 4chan message board from back in July. That thread started when an anonymous user invited questions after describing themself as  a person with intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case.  (Adl-Tabatabai did not respond to questions sent to him by BuzzFeed News.) By this point, the story became a viral ball of fire, and there was no stopping it.You have to wonder if the spirit cooking/pizzagate emails, might have been used as a tripwire by the establishment to initiate increased internet censorship, a story that has gathered a big boost from highly speculative ideas pasted together by various social media personalities on YouTube and then codified by large popular  alt-media  outlets like Infowars.com here and here, who levied unconfirmed allegations at Comet Ping Pong restaurant and other private businesses in an affluent area of Washington DC.Few conspiracies in recent years have generated as much public outrage, scrutiny and intense speculation. However, we should question the timing of this conspiracy as it relates to the cyber censorship on the table following the  fake news  crisis.The BBC stated the following after a Podesta email thread leaked in November, mentioned the Alefantis connection: In early November, as Wikileaks steadily released piles of emails from Clinton s campaign chairman John Podesta, one contact caught the attention of prankster sites and people on the paranoid fringes.James Alefantis is the owner of Comet Ping Pong, a pizza restaurant in Washington. He s also a big Democratic Party supporter and raised money for both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. He was once in a relationship with David Brock, an influential liberal operative.Alefantis   who s never met Clinton   appeared in the Podesta emails in connection with the fundraisers. Other claims attached to the pizzagate theory included a link to a tweet from the deceased investigative reporter, Andrew Breitbart. The pizzagate theory seemed to gather steam from this screenshot of an alleged Breitbart tweet below   but is there more to the story?Upon reviewing the origins of the Breitbart tweet now intertwined with the pizzagate theory, there appears to be some contention about what Breitbart might have been referencing. Here s the political blog Hot Air on the matter: It s a classic Andrew Tweet. His abbreviations, his invention of words ( cover-upperer ) tells me that this was probably Andrew s work. I never really knew him to allow anyone to Tweet on his behalf but I suppose it s possible at some point he did so without my knowledge. So, for our discussion let s stipulate that it was Andrew who sent this out. What is he talking about? Anyone who knew Andrew well and worked closely in his sphere and knew what he would talk and Tweet about with regard to  underage sex slave(s)  and John Podesta, knows exactly what he is referring to: ACORN If you don t remember James O Keefe, Hanna Giles and the ACORN story that broke on Andrew s Big Government website in 2009, here s a quick description via Wikipedia, which has a lot of bogus takes on the story, but this brief description is correct: In July and August 2009, Giles and O Keefe visited ACORN offices in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Brooklyn, San Bernardino, San Diego, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Miami. Giles dressed as a prostitute, while O Keefe wore white khakis with a blue dress shirt and/or tie and claimed to be her boyfriend. Giles and O Keefe recorded the encounters using hidden cameras and pretended to be seeking advice on how to run an illegal business that included the use of underage girls in the sex trade. The article goes on to state that the ACORN saga, which had been instrumental in Breitbart s rise in media, had been in some aspect involved an underage abuse story due to the undercover work of James O keefe and Hannah Giles.  STRANGE DAYS    Comet Ping Pong resides in a quiet affluent DC neighborhood. (Image Source: chicago sun-times)The Comet Ping Pong GunmanIn early December, 28 year-old actor Edgar Maddison Welch was arrested by authorities after reportedly discharging a rifle inside Alefantis s Comet Ping Pong restaurant. Welch had been apparently  self-investigating  Comet Ping Pong, the pizzeria at the epicenter of a shocking conspiracy asserting that the establishment is somehow allegedly involved in an expansive child trafficking abuse ring.Welch s background may have raised a few eyebrows of those who have chronicled the profiles of various gunman in recent years (such as his acting/film production past documented on IMDB), he was also recently involved in a major traffic accident in October, badly injuring a young teenager, potentially impacting his state of mind, as well as being exposed in a potential criminal case.While 21WIRE has outlined the possibility of informants being used in shooting events in the past   usually those individuals have had a lengthy criminal past with multiple links to government, military and sometimes the entertainment industry   Welch doesn t entirely fit this typical mold of a convict turned informant or agent provocateur.Perhaps there s another answer The online site Heavy.com released the following information regarding Welch s father and his work preventing child abductions: Harry Welch Jr. is a former police officer, firearms instructor and expert witness on firearms, according to his IMDB profile. He also writes that his family has hosted foster children and has worked to prevent child abuse.He was,  elected President of the North Carolina Crime Stoppers Association (two terms). Served as Executive Director for Protect-A-Child, a national, non-profit organization to prevent abuse and abduction of children. Appointed by Governor Jim Martin to the Governor s Commission on Child Victimization. Was Welch under psychological duress following his recent car accident, feeding into other aspects of his life, such as his father s work to prevent child abuse, then motivated into action by an online conspiracy?Although it s difficult to accurately gauge Welch s true motivation, some YouTube personalities absolutely contend that his involvement was scripted    to smear the a new burgeoning  pizzagate research community  online. Additionally, some researchers cite Welch s relief visit to Haiti in 2010, as absolute  proof of a hoax  because alleged Clinton Foundation ties to human trafficking in Haiti   claims that have to this date, have yet to be completely proven.This part of the pizzagate conspiracy gained steam when Monica Petersen, an activist for sex-worker rights, who over the summer was working for  Claude d Estree, the executive director of the Human Trafficking Center at the University of Denver,  apparently died of a suicide in mid November while in Haiti. However, at the time the circumstances of her death were not entirely clear, which led to intense speculation not grounded in fact. If there was evidence of foul play, certainly this could be investigated as part of a possible cover-up, especially during such a hotly contested US election involving the Clintons   but until that issue is resolved, any talk of  proof  of a wider conspiracy is still just that, talk.The Petersen tragedy was then grafted onto the pizzagate story The Washington Post reported the following, according to executive director d Estree:  Petersen had gone to Haiti a number of times, but she was not there to research human trafficking and was not investigating the Clinton Foundation. He said she had been a  brilliant  research fellow, working the past two years to produce a still unpublished article that critiqued a controversial book on the business of sex trafficking by Siddharth Kara. Unfortunately, Petersen s story got packaged with allegations of a Clinton trafficking conspiracy that was then interwoven within the pizzagate theory and on the same day Welch walked into Comet Ping Pong, the widely-known site Infowars.com  posted a YouTube video titled  Haiti PIZZAGATE: Death of Child Trafficking Investigator,  without actually confirming the full details surrounding Petersen s death. Everpedia, one of the first websites to explain the details of spirit cooking, appeared to also fan the flames of an alleged conspiracy surrounding Petersen s death.An ABC News release below disclosed the full details regarding Welch s apparent criminal activity at Comet Ping Pong: At around 3 p.m., he arrived at the restaurant, where witnesses say they saw Welch holding an assault rifle across his chest, according to the complaint. As he moved toward the back of the restaurant, employees and customers fled the building.As everyone was fleeing, Welch encountered an employee returning from the back freezer, according to court documents. The employee said Welch pointed the AR-15 rifle in his direction, the documents state, but Welch denied raising the firearm at the employee.After the customers and employees left the restaurant, police created a perimeter around it, and at about 3:24 p.m. Welch exited the building with his hands in the air, complying with officers. The story continued, with the following description: At one point he said he encountered a locked door and attempted to open it with a butter knife, the complaint says. When that didn t work, he fired shots at the lock with his AR-15, documents say. Here s a screen shot of Welch s incident report MSM Fake News Witch-HuntFor the mainstream media, pizzagate was the gift that just kept on giving.Following Welch s encounter inside Comet Ping Pong, the conspiracy known as  pizzagate  has fallen into the manipulative hands of the corporate mainstream media, now castigating  speculative alternative media outlets,  which in-turn gave legs to the already convoluted  fake news witch-hunt being waged by mainstream media   specifically aimed at independent outlets and blogs that regularly produce insightful critical analysis.Additionally, since the spirit cooking and pizzagate theories were merging, there has been no solid evidence linking the restaurant to anything criminal, yet the theories continue to persist online, implicating private citizens in what is at this point a  victimless  crime. This has made alternative media an easy target for mainstream media and politicians calling for more  control  over social media content to help stop waht mainstream pundits were now describing as pizzagate s own campaign online abuse and  internet bullying  against Comet Ping Pong s owner and staff.From a legal stand point, the pizzagate conspiracy could also potentially lead to a court case against the root cause of certain defamatory allegations and apparent death threats   as Alefantis and other shop owners are private citizens and not public figures. This is something to consider when presenting any possible theory directly implicating an individual in a major felony. Unless there exists a real forensic smoking gun, or a whistleblower willing to come forward then there is no  case    only speculation which could be construed as libel and defamation without any supporting evidence.While the internet has zeroed-in on pizzeria-based conspiracies over the past two months, it s important to remember that Washington has had a long dark history linked to illicit prostitution and sex trafficking   including at least two such expansive cases that reached all the way to the White House   DISGRACED    Former US Congressman Barney Frank. Frank did not seek re-lection in 2012 after he was found to have engineered a $12 million TARP bailout for OneUnited Bank. (Image Source: businessinsider.com)Washington s Silence: Congressman Frank s  Call Boys In 2011, Democratic Congressman Barney Frank, decided not to seek re-election. While much of the mainstream media waxed poetic about his 30-year career, there was virtually no mention of his involvement in one of the most notable DC scandals over the past three decades.In 1989, it was discovered that Frank s then boyfriend Stephen Gobie (who the US representative once solicited for an $80 dollar sexual encounter) had been running a prostitution ring out of Congressman Frank s Capitol Hill apartment   according to Gobie, Barney Frank was fully aware of the operation.Here s a passage from a Business Insider article from 2011 that describes one of DC s darkest scandals that is barely mentioned by media outlets to this day: Reuters didn t mention it. The New York Times didn t bring it up. The Guardian didn t note it either. The Washington Post got to it in the 17th paragraph.In 1989 it was discovered that Barney Frank s boyfriend, Stephen Gobie, whom Frank had once hired as a male prostitute, was running a male-brothel out of the Congressman s home. Frank claimed he did not know about the prostitution ring in his home, but he did use the power of his office to  fix  33 tickets for Gobie. And he knowingly wrote a misleading letter to Gobie s probation officer in Virginia. Frank received a  reprimand  for fixing the tickets. Gobie maintained that Frank knew about the prostitution ring operation in his home. Even writers who were absolutely untroubled by the openly homosexual lawmaker in 1989 thought that Frank should have resigned. Or they at least acknowledged that there was an abuse of his office. Additionally, the Washington Post reported that Gobie  maintained a relationship with Gabriel A. Massaro, the principal of Chevy Chase Elementary School, and used an office at the school in late 1987 to make telephone calls and have one client meet a prostitute. While Massaro was placed on administrative leave, the conspiracy deepened as the Washington Post followed up the breaking story providing the following details: With Congress in recess, it s too soon to tell if the Massachusetts Democrat will weather his admission that he paid Gobie for sex, hired him as a personal aide and wrote letters on congressional stationary to the convicted felon s probation officer. Shockingly, the scandal continued to persist as the investigation led to other political inquiries. Frank s scandal appeared to overlap and dovetail with another disturbing ring that reached all the way to the White House during the Reagan-Bush era.The Franklin Cover-upThe Barney Frank scandal indeed followed another appalling and chilling scandal dubbed the  Franklin Cover-up.  The shocking case involving Omaha, Nebraska s Franklin Credit Union employee named Lawrence King, who looted his employer to the tune of $38 million dollars. Here s a Washington Post article from 1990 on the matter: Lawrence E. King Jr., everyone now agrees, had a remarkable knack for stretching a dollar. On a salary of $16,200 a year, the credit union manager drove a $70,000 white Mercedes   and still could afford to spend $10,000 a month on limousines. His credit card charges topped $1 million, he owned a four-story house on 26 acres overlooking the Missouri River, and his floral bill alone came to $146,000 during a fragrant, 13-month period in 1987-88. While King s embezzlement was troublesome, it paled into comparison to a wider charge of trafficking and abuse levied at the credit union manager. The Post continued, outlining the awful truth about the abuse tied to King, in a group called the Franklin Five: In June 1988, a social worker at a mental hospital in Omaha reported allegations of possible child abuse to the Nebraska Foster Care Review Board, an agency that monitors the placement of several thousand children in the state.The board subsequently asked Omaha police and the state attorney general to investigate possible  child exploitation,  a  child prostitution ring  and  inappropriate activities by Larry King. More evidence in the same report revealed the following: 21 hours of videotaped testimony from three new witnesses, all in their early twenties, who said that, as minors, they had been victims of physical and sexual abuse. The book entitled The Franklin Cover-up, by former Nebraska state Senator and lawyer, John De Camp, chronicled a case that implicated politicians, judges, those in the military, police, as well as members of the intelligence community in the subsequent abduction of numerous children over the course of many years.Lawrence King was eventually convicted on charges of theft from the Franklin Credit Union and ordered to pay damages to Paul Bonacci for the apparent abuse he suffered during his abduction. Bonacci later told investigators he had participated in the abduction of Johnny Gosch, but according to (Polk County Attorney John Sarcone ) The Des Moines Resgister,  Bonacci has said he took part in Johnny Gosch s abduction, but Sarcone said investigators concluded any involvement by Bonacci was not credible. Here s a short summary of the disturbing case below: On February 5, 1999, in U.S. District Court in Lincoln, Nebraska, an extraordinary hearing occurred in Paul A. Bonacci v. Lawrence E. King, a civil action in which the plaintiff charged that he had been ritualistically abused by the defendant, as part of a nationwide pedophile ring linked to powerful political figures in Washington and to elements of the U.S. military and intelligence establishment. Three weeks later, on February 27, Judge Warren K. Urbom ordered King, who is currently in Federal prison, to pay $1 million in damages to Bonacci, in what Bonacci s attorney John DeCamp said was a clear signal that  the evidence presented was credible. The Frank and Franklin conspiracies outlined above sent shock waves through the establishment in Washington, and while it is possible we are seeing another trafficking cover-up happening again today, one should consider that thus far, there have been no victims found to have been abused regarding Comet Ping Pong or any other business wrapped up within the online pizzagate theory.A Franklin Cover-up documentary called  Conspiracy of Silence  was made and allegedly pulled from circulation following the fallout from a case that also implicated the Catholic founded non-profit orphanage, Boys Town.In a related scandal exposed in 2002, The Boston Globe s Spotlight Team  first revealed that the leader of the Catholic Church in Boston, Cardinal Bernard Law, allowed one of his priests to continue working even though Law knew that Fr. John Geoghan had spent his career sexually assaulting children. The story became so huge, that it led to more than 250 priests being publicly named in abuse allegations, covering some 100 cities in the US and another 100 globally. In 2015, Hollywood released the film Spotlight, which chronicled the tales of abuse.Similarly in the UK, over the past few years, an investigation into the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal  was compounded by BBC s own cover-up of the serious claims. The Savile scandal and cover-up featured many whistleblowers and victims coming forward, and also showed a high degree of cover-up at the police department level as well.While observing the connective aspects of various scandals, DC s political scene has also revealed some telling business and establishment links which raise even more interesting questions   MEDIA MACHINE    Democratic political operative David Brock. (Image Source: twitter)There are some interesting aspects of pizzagate which have been almost untouched by internet sleuths.Below we ll take a look at George Soros-funded Media Matters and its director David Brock and examine his past connections and tangential links to both Barney Frank and James Alefantis Media Matters  & Political PlotsIn 1997, political operative David Brock was once a right-wing media hit-man so to speak, writing conservative op-ed s taking on college campus  marxists  and was an investigative reporter for the weekly news magazine Insight on the News (published by The Washington Times). Some time later, Brock became a Democratic political operative and Soros righthand man at Media Matters.Some reports also claim that Brock (seen on the left with Barney Frank) joined on with Sidney Blumenthal and the Clintons simply over money   but others suggest a different tale   one that took place during the course of Brock completing a somewhat strange book entitled  The Seduction of Hillary Clinton,  which deflected controversies aimed at the Clintons and took a softball approach to Hillary s political evolution.Over the years, many critics have questioned Brock s hidden Washington past and his unlikely political evolution Blackmail? Brock, Grey & AlefantisIn 2012, FOX NEWS revealed the following, as Media Matters chief David Brock paid a former domestic partner $850,000 after being threatened with damaging information involving the organization s donors and the IRS   a deal that Brock later characterized as a blackmail payment, according to legal documents obtained by FoxNews.com. Brock s bitter separation from William Grey led to accusations of blackmail and harassment: In an acrimonious lawsuit settled at the end of last year, Brock accused William Grey of making repeated threats to expose him to the  scorn or ridicule of his employees, donors and the press in demanding money and property.  Brock claimed in legal papers that he sold a Rehoboth Beach, Del., home he once shared with Grey in order to meet Grey s demands, which he called  blackmail  in the lawsuit. Brock s legal trouble with Grey appeared to be the result of a severed relationship after 10 years, with Brock ending the relationship, he began dating Washington, D.C., restaurant impresario James Alefantis,  according to reports.Considering how Brock and Grey s end played out according to court records revealed by the media, one might consider that this latest DC drama unfolding in the form of pizzagate, could also be the result of bad-jacketing (as suggested by the blog auticulture) after a bitter love triangle involving the trio   in the lead up to one of the most contentious US presidential elections in history.According to Ward Churchill s,  Agents of Repression: The FBI s Secret Wars Against the Black Panther Party and the American Indian Movement: Snitch-jacketing or bad-jacketing refers to the practice creating suspicion   through the spread of rumors, manufacture of evidence etc Bad-jacketing had been a technique employed by the FBI under their program COINTELPRO.Domestically in America, the FBI created the counter-intelligence program known as COINTELPRO, to influence, disrupt and coerce political factions from the inside out, infiltrating countless political groups and movements. According to reports these included the following,  The Black Panther Party, The Communist Party of America, the Ku Klux Klan, the Socialist Workers Party, the New Left, the Students for a Democratic Society, the American Indian Movement, the Chicano Movement, the Puerto Rican Liberation Movement, Communist groups, anti-war organizations, Hollywood stars sympathetic to these groups, and civil rights leaders. Between 1956 and 1971 the FBI s controversial program influenced and radicalized hundreds of left-wing and right-wing groups to control and neutralize political dissidents across America. No part of politics was immune to COINTELPRO.Is it possible that a DC love triangle that once involved Brock, Grey & Alefantis, led to a PR-driven form (as a part of Brock s Correct the Record or something else) of bad-jacketing which then cascaded through the Democratic Party elite, ultimately taking its triangle shape   through the use of pizzagate and others? MEDIA CONTROL    (Photo illustration redesigned by 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)Censorship & the  Fake News  Witch-HuntIn early November, just prior to the US presidential election, CNN published an article stating the following: A recent BuzzFeed study of  hyperpartisan Facebook pages  found that these pages  are consistently feeding their millions of followers false or misleading information. Three weeks later in a republished article written by Robert Parry from Consortium News, it was disclosed that major media companies had been heavily involved in pushing the fake news meme, citing many election-based posts made online as the culprit: In its lead editorial on Sunday, The New York Times decried what it deemed  The Digital Virus Called Fake News  and called for Internet censorship to counter this alleged problem, taking particular aim at Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for letting  liars and con artists hijack his platform. Below is a passage from a recent report filed at 21WIRE discussing the fake news witch-hunt, which has now led to new calls for internet censorship: Over the past month, The Washington Post published an irresponsible propaganda piece that blamed the 2016 US election results on  fake news  dispensed via sophisticated Russian propaganda. These accusations of course were completely unfounded, deliberately feeding into a paranoid trial by media format that is no doubt echoed by US government sock puppet accounts that act as a digital firing squad by redirecting public perception.While the US mainstream media contends that  fake news  somehow altered the 2016 presidential election cycle, it s important to remember that the US government has some pedigree here, having been behind the creation of bogus social media accounts and personalities for years now.Back in 2011, The UK s Guardian reported that the US government via CENTCOM, was looking to gain a foothold over information shared on the internet through fake online personal accounts: The discovery that the US military is developing false online personalities   known to users of social media as  sock puppets    could also encourage other governments, private companies and non-government organisations to do the same.The Centcom contract stipulates that each fake online persona must have a convincing background, history and supporting details, and that up to 50 US-based controllers should be able to operate false identities from their workstations  without fear of being discovered by sophisticated adversaries . This is just one example. Who really knows how widespread this practice is.You can expect a litany of allegations to continue from the mainstream, along with their faux war on fake news sites which has been used deliberately to discredit and frame genuine investigative analysis in alternative media, its intended target. Western media s anti-Russian hyperbole has morphed and broadened somewhat, thanks to Facebook, Google and Twitter and the alphabet establishment news agencies, Washington has a new go-to scapegoat joining the tired old Russian  hack  meme   independent media. SEE ALSO: Washington Post Sloppy  Journalism  Blames Russia for  Fake News  Crisis and Trump s Win, While Pushing Neo-McCarthyismIt appears as though there has been a coordinated effort to combine the latest run of conspiracies in America, whether it s the fake news meme, the  Russian election-hack  meme or pizzagate    they all seem to be have been used to undermine key aspects of internet freedom.Below is an interview with James Alefantis featured on Megyn Kelly s Kelly File discussing the highly speculative pizzagate theory. During Kelly s interview, the focus centered around unsubstantiated claims levied at the business owner and his place of business Here s a very detailed analysis provided by researcher David Icke discussing the multi-layered theories wrapped up in the pizzagate conspiracy and its relation to censorship and so-called  fake news In ConclusionThe overtly conspiracy-tinged pizzagate theory, emerged like a hydra out of sub-Reddit and 4chan threads and Twitter posts, while catapulting only the most sensational aspects into the mainstream matrix. The story conjures many Hollywood and government tales of cover-up, murder, abuse and deception throughout history.The perceived presence of a politically charged Satanic sex-cult intertwined within a paedophilic abuse ring, seemed to have only enhanced the narrative for many internet-sleuths, who in some cases, held steadfast to a biased guilt-by-association meme   even in the absence of any known victims, and without any forensic evidence or any eye-witness testimony of a crime.This is not to suggest that VIP child sex rings and ritual abuse cases do not exist in America. One such murder spree, known as the  Son of Sam  case, was reopened in part due to evidence of Satanic cult activity and multiple offenders. Although the findings were suspended, the case was never officially closed.While people should certainly have the ability to express their opinion about pizzagate without shame or ridicule, using biased, misleading or fraudulent information (in some cases dispensing defamatory or threatening remarks) in a rapid-fire echo chamber, could ultimately undermine any legitimate investigation if there truly was a crime committed here, or elsewhere. If that is the ultimate legacy of pizzagate, then it is a devastating self-inflicted wound for the alternative media.While it s true that sites like Reddit and Twitter could cite the 1996 Communications Decency Act, as a protection for hosting defamatory information posts by users, there could be real consequences for those deliberately posting defamatory content with no real evidence to substantiate such allegations.Another risk with a whirlwind like this, is that it would be very easy for an agent provocateur to post a slick YouTube video or craft an article   with the intention of whipping-up a storm that could be used to damage independent media as a whole. It s very possible that this has already happened at some point over the life of the internet, and it s certain that the powers that be will use this tactic again in the future.Above all however, it s important to separate the fallout from the pizzagate story and other fake news allegations, as those in mainstream media such as The New York Times, The Washington Post and the self-anointed  fact checker Snopes.com, seem to have propped up this pizzeria conspiracy as a battle cry to introduce the idea of new internet censorship protocols.It s anybody s guess what will be the final outcome of the #Pizzagate phenomenon, but for the moment, it seems to have collapsed under the weight of its own mountain of digital ash. Maybe that was the idea. READ MORE MSM LIES AT: 21st Century Wire MSM FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE NOW & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"December 28, 2016"
23087,2017 NDAA: Obama Signs “Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act”,"21st Century Wire says In typical NDAA signing fashion, Obama signed the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) quietly and with little fan fare as Americans are distracted by the mholiday festivities. What dirty tricks can we expect to see in the 2017 NDAA? Coming from the policy makers that struck down the Smith Mundt Act and legalized indefinite detention of Americans in past iterations, we re sure it can t be benign this year. The Hypocrisy of legalizing propaganda (overturning the Smith Mundt Act) then creating an act to counter propaganda: What are we to make of this new  Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act  included in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act? The politicians and the mainstream media outlets have shown their cards yet again with a massive contradiction in policy. In one iteration of the NDAA policy makers overturn Smith Mundt thereby legalizing state sponsored propaganda to be used on the citizens of the United States and in the latest iteration we see the NDAA include an act to counter disinformation and propaganda. We can easily make the connection that in the wake of the  Fake News  hash tag war that has been unleashed upon independent media, with FaceBook partnering with government sponsored  Fact Checking  sites and algorithms being put in place to remove so-called  Fake News  from social media feeds, that this latest addition to the NDAA does not bode well for independent media and has massive potential to be abused for political purposes.  Tyler Durden Zero HedgeLate on Friday, with the US population embracing the upcoming holidays and oblivious of most news emerging from the administration, Obama quietly signed into law the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which authorizes $611 billion for the military in 2017.In a statement, Obama said that:Today, I have signed into law S. 2943, the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.  This Act authorizes fiscal year 2017 appropriations principally for the Department of Defense and for Department of Energy national security programs, provides vital benefits for military personnel and their families, and includes authorities to facilitate ongoing operations around the globe. It continues many critical authorizations necessary to ensure that we are able to sustain our momentum in countering the threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and to reassure our European allies, as well as many new authorizations that, among other things, provide the Departments of Defense and Energy more flexibility in countering cyber-attacks and our adversaries  use of unmanned aerial vehicles. Much of the balance of Obama s statement blamed the GOP for Guantanamo s continued operation and warned that  unless the Congress changes course, it will be judged harshly by history,  Obama said. Obama also said Congress failed to use the bill to reduce wasteful overhead (like perhaps massive F-35 cost overruns?) or modernize military health care, which he said would exacerbate budget pressures facing the military in the years ahead.But while the passage of the NDAA   and the funding of the US military   was hardly a surprise, the biggest news is what was buried deep inside the provisions of the Defense Authortization Act.Recall that as we reported in early June,  a bill to implement the U.S.  very own de facto Ministry of Truth had been quietly introduced in Congress. As with any legislation attempting to dodge the public spotlight the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act of 2016 marks a further curtailment of press freedom and another avenue to stultify avenues of accurate information. Introduced by Congressmen Adam Kinzinger and Ted Lieu, H.R. 5181 seeks a  whole-government approach without the bureaucratic restrictions  to counter  foreign disinformation and manipulation,  which they believe threaten the world s  security and stability. Also called the Countering Information Warfare Act of 2016 (S. 2692), when introduced in March by Sen. Rob Portman, the legislation represents a dramatic return to Cold War-era government propaganda battles.  These countries spend vast sums of money on advanced broadcast and digital media capabilities, targeted campaigns, funding of foreign political movements, and other efforts to influence key audiences and populations,  Portman explained, adding that while the U.S. spends a relatively small amount on its Voice of America, the Kremlin provides enormous funding for its news organization, RT. Surprisingly,  Portman continued,  there is currently no single U.S. governmental agency or department charged with the national level development, integration and synchronization of whole-of-government strategies to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation. Long before the  fake news  meme became a daily topic of extensive conversation on such discredited mainstream portals as CNN and WaPo, H.R. 5181 would task the Secretary of State with coordinating the Secretary of Defense, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Broadcasting Board of Governors to  establish a Center for Information Analysis and Response,  which will pinpoint sources of disinformation, analyze data, and   in true dystopic manner    develop and disseminate   fact-based narratives  to counter effrontery propaganda.In short, long before  fake news  became a major media topic, the US government was already planning its legally-backed crackdown on anything it would eventually label  fake news. * * *Fast forward to December 8, when the  Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act  passed in the Senate, quietly inserted inside the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Conference Report.And now, following Friday s Obama signing of the NDAA on Friday evening, the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act is now law.* * *Here is the full statement issued by the generously funded Senator Rob Portman (R- Ohio) on the singing into law of a bill that further chips away at press liberties in the US, and which sets the stage for future which hunts and website shutdowns, purely as a result of an accusation that any one media outlet or site is considered as a source of  disinformation and propaganda  and is shut down by the government.President Signs Portman-Murphy Counter-Propaganda Bill into LawPortman-Murphy Bill Promotes Coordinated Strategy to Defend America, Allies Against Propaganda and Disinformation from Russia, China & OthersU.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Chris Murphy (D-CT) today announced that their Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act   legislation designed to help American allies counter foreign government propaganda from Russia, China, and other nations   has been signed into law as part of the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Conference Report. The bipartisan bill, which was introduced by Senators Portman and Murphy in March, will improve the ability of the United States to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation from our enemies by establishing an interagency center housed at the State Department to coordinate and synchronize counter-propaganda efforts throughout the U.S. government. To support these efforts, the bill also creates a grant program for NGOs, think tanks, civil society and other experts outside government who are engaged in counter-propaganda related work. This will better leverage existing expertise and empower our allies overseas to defend themselves from foreign manipulation. It will also help foster a free and vibrant press and civil society overseas, which is critical to ensuring our allies have access to truthful information and inoculating people against foreign propaganda campaigns. Our enemies are using foreign propaganda and disinformation against us and our allies, and so far the U.S. government has been asleep at the wheel,  Portman said.  But today, the United States has taken a critical step towards confronting the extensive, and destabilizing, foreign propaganda and disinformation operations being waged against us by our enemies overseas. With this bill now law, we are finally signaling that enough is enough; the United States will no longer sit on the sidelines. We are going to confront this threat head-on. I am confident that, with the help of this bipartisan bill, the disinformation and propaganda used against us, our allies, and our interests will fail. The use of propaganda to undermine democracy has hit a new low. But now we are finally in a position to confront this threat head on and get out the truth. By building up independent, objective journalism in places like eastern Europe, we can start to fight back by exposing these fake narratives and empowering local communities to protect themselves,  said Murphy.  I m proud that our bill was signed into law, and I look forward to working with Senator Portman to make sure these tools and new resources are effectively used to get out the truth. NOTE: The bipartisan Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act is organized around two main priorities to help achieve the goal of combatting the constantly evolving threat of foreign disinformation from our enemies Continue this report at Zero HedgeREAD MORE MSM LIES AT: 21st Century Wire MSM Watch Files",Middle-east,"December 25, 2016"
23088,Obama Signs Star Wars II Defense Bill: Hypocrisy of Blaming Trump for “Arms Race”,"21st Century Wire says While politicians and news media alike are accusing Trump of pushing an  arms race  in his December 22nd Tweet about strengthening America s nuclear capability, the Obama administration made a landmark change to the policies governing space based weapons under the guise of missile defense. Why is the mainstream media silent on what Obama just did? Not only does this potentially damage relationships with other military powers such as Russia and China but is being called a massive waste of money. Leading defence scientists said the idea that a space-based system could provide security against nuclear attack is a fantasy   Tyler Durden Zero HedgeAs politicians and mainstream media blast Trump s apparently incendiary tweet regarding nuclear arms, none other than President Obama just signed legislation that, by striking a single word from longstanding US nuclear defence policy, could heighten tensions with Russia and China and launch the country on an expensive effort to build space-based defense systems.Oh the irony  Following Trump s tweet The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016The mainstream media has lambasted the president-elect for  endangering the world  and  starting another nuclear arms race.  However, that same mainstream media appears mute in their response to what President Obama just did The National Defence Authorisation Act, a year-end policy bill encompassing virtually every aspect of the US military, contained two provisions with potentially momentous consequences. As AP reports,One struck the word  limited  from language describing the mission of the country s homeland missile defence system. The system is said to be designed to thwart a small-scale attack by a non-superpower such as North Korea or Iran.A related provision calls for the Pentagon to start  research, development, test and evaluation  of space-based systems for missile defence.Together, the provisions signal that the US will seek to use advanced technology to defeat both small-scale and large-scale nuclear attacks.That could unsettle the decades-old balance of power among the major nuclear states.Huge bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress approved the policy changes over the past month, with virtually no public debate.Although the White House had earlier criticised the changes, it stopped short of threatening a veto. On Friday, Obama signed the legislation.Leading defence scientists said the idea that a space-based system could provide security against nuclear attack is a fantasy It defies the laws of physics and is not based on science of any kind,  said L. David Montague, a retired president of missile systems for Lockheed and co-chair of a National Academy of Sciences panel that studied missile defence technologies at the request of Congress. Even if we darken the sky with hundreds or thousands of satellites and interceptors, there s no way to ensure against a dedicated attack,  Montague said in an interview.  So it s an opportunity to waste a prodigious amount of money. He called the provisions passed by Congress  insanity, pure and simple. Republican Congressman Trent Franks, who introduced and shepherded the policy changes in the House, said he drew inspiration from former president Ronald Reagan s Strategic Defence Initiative of the 1980s, which was intended to use lasers and other space-based weaponry to render nuclear weapons  impotent and obsolete.  Known as  Star Wars , the initiative cost taxpayers US$30 billion, but no system was ever deployed.Philip E. Coyle III, a former assistant secretary of defence who headed the Pentagon office responsible for testing and evaluating weapon systems, described the idea of a space-based nuclear shield as  a sham . To do this would cost just gazillions and gazillions,  Coyle said.  The technology isn t at hand   nor is the money. It s unfortunate from my point of view that the Congress doesn t see that. He added:  Both Russia and China will use it as an excuse to do something that they want to do.

23093,SUNDAY SCREENING: ‘A Noble Lie’ (2011),"21st Century Wire says Our weekly documentary film curated by our editorial team at 21WIRE The 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was an event that shook the United States domestic scene. Up to that date, it was the largest act of  domestic terrorism  in America, killing some 168 people including nineteen children. However, many have questioned the government s official account of events. A Noble Lie re-investigates the bombing and re-examines the event s alleged perpetrators, as well as other unlikely role player on the periphery. What this film reveals may shock many viewers who thought they knew what happened that day, exposing information never before examined or brought to the attention of the American public.

23094,FLASHBACK: ‘The Syrian War: What You’re Not Being Told’ (About Chemical Weapons),"21st Century Wire says Back in August 2013, United Nations investigators led by Carla Del Ponte found evidence that alleged chemical weapons attacks by the Syrian military were actually staged by US, Saudi and Qatari-backed jihadist  rebels.  By definition, this was a false flag attack. Regardless of the facts, western media and political leaders still decided to blame Damascus for the incident. The object of this game was simple: to engineer a virtual  violation  of Obama s famous Red Line, providing the legal pretext, however spurious, for the use of Western military force against the nation state of Syria   under the guise of the great 21st century western military intervention tactic known as the  Responsibility to Protect  (R2P). This video was uploaded by Storm Clouds Gathering on Sept 3, 2013, and it demonstrated how when the entire mainstream media is going one way   pushing a fraudulent event for the purposes of generating a new war   alternative media outlets were reporting the truth. History is on the side of alternative media, not for the likes of CNN, ABC, NBC, BBC and Al Jazeera. That was the week when everyone in the west thought that the US-led military action against Syria was a fait accompli. Thanks to a brief wave of sanity which swept through the British Parliament, the US could not proceed forward without appearing  Hilteresque themselves. Despite all the hype and all the mainstream media fake news, Washington and London s official conspiracy theory was that Assad crossed a red line by using sarin gas against his own people.

23095,Hannity Interview with Julian Assange: Wikileaks Source is NOT The Russian Government,"21st Century Wire says Fox News  Sean Hannity has broken away from the majority of Western news reporters and has gone to Wikileaks  Julian Assange to ask him directly,  Was your source for the DNC leaks of Russian origin? Watch the interview below: How refreshing to see a mainstream media commentator actually look into the unfounded claims of Russian hacker involvement in the DNC leaks and the US Presidential election.   Alex Christoforou The DuranHannity interviews Julian Assange, who once again confirms that Russia had no role to play in the Wikileaks email leak.Fox News  Sean Hannity is perhaps the first main stream media commentator who has gone deeper on the Russian election hacker  fake news  story than other MSM journalist.Hannity interviewed Julian Assange, who once again confirmed that Russia and  no state actor  was the source of the Wikileaks Podesta emails or DNC leaks.Hannity is also the only MSM show to explore the Craig Murray report, that chronicles the genesis of the leaks stating that the former Ambassador had met with the source of the email leaks confirming and corroborating Assange s factual claim that no state actor, including Russia, was involved in any kind of  hack  or leak.Continue this article at The DuranREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"December 17, 2016"
23096,Putin Tells Obama and Western Media: “Either stop talking about it or finally show some kind of proof”,"21st Century Wire says It appears that Putin has had enough with being accused of tampering with the US election process this year. The Russian President s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, pointed out that it was  indecent  of the US to accuse Russia of tampering with its election.   Remember: On Thursday evening CNN reported that Barack Obama vowed to retaliate against Russia for the  hack  that has not been verified by any independent sources nor has it provided a shred of evidence to support the claim   Tyler Durden Zero HedgePutin has had enough of the relentless barrage of US accusations that he, personally,  hacked the US presidential election. The Russian president s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that the US must either stop accusing Russia of meddling in its elections or prove it. Peskov said it was  indecent  of the United States to  groundlessly  accuse Russia of intervention in its elections. You need to either stop talking about it, or finally show some kind of proof. Otherwise it just looks very indecent , Peskov told Reporters in Tokyo where Putin is meeting with Japan PM Abe, responding to the latest accusations that Russia was responsible for hacker attacks.Peskov also warned that Obama s threat to  retaliate  to the alleged Russian hack is  against both American and international law , hinting at open-ended escalation should Obama take the podium today at 2:15pm to officially launch cyberwar against Russia.Previously, on Thursday, Peskov told the AP the report was  laughable nonsense , while Russian foreign ministry spox Maria Zakharova accused  Western media  of being a  shill  and a  mouthpiece of various power groups , and added that  it s not the general public who s being manipulated,  Zakharova said.  the general public nowadays can distinguish the truth. It s the mass media that is manipulating themselves. Meanwhile, on Friday Sergei Lavrov, Russia s foreign minister told state television network, Russia 24, he was  dumbstruck  by the NBC report which alleges that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved in an election hack.The report cited U.S. intelligence officials that now believe with a  high level of confidence  that Putin became personally involved in a secret campaign to influence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.  I think this is just silly, and the futility of the attempt to convince somebody of this is absolutely obvious,  Lavrov added, according to the news outlet.As a reminder, last night Obama vowed retaliatory action against Russia for its meddling in the US presidential election last month.   I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections that we need to take action and we will at a time and place of our own choosing,  Obama told National Public Radio.US intelligence agencies in October pinned blame on Russia for election-related hacking. At the time, the White House vowed a  proportional response  to the cyberactivity, though declined to preview what that response might entail. Meanwhile, both President-elect Donald Trump, the FBI,and the ODNI have dismissed the CIA s intelligence community s assessment, for the the same reason Putin finally lashed out at Obama: there is no proof.That, however, has never stopped the US from escalating a geopolitical conflict to the point of war, or beyond, so pay close attention to what Obama says this afternoon.According to an NBC report, a team of analysts at Eurasia Group said in a note on Friday that they believe the outgoing administration is likely to take action which could result in a significant barrier for Trump s team once he takes office in January. It is unlikely that U.S. intelligence reports will change Trump s intention to initiate a rapprochement with Moscow, but the congressional response following its own investigations could obstruct the new administration s effort,  Eurasia Group analysts added.Continue the story at Zero HedgeREAD MORE MSM LIES AT: 21st Century Wire MSM Watch Files",Middle-east,"December 17, 2016"
23097,BREAKING: At Least 14 US Coalition Military Officers Captured by Syrian Special Forces in East Aleppo Bunker," Syrian Army soldier holds up Al Nusra Front (al Qaeda in Syria) flag in the Umayyed Mosque, Old City, after government troops liberated terrorist-occupied East Aleppo this week (Image: Vanessa Beeley for 21st Century Wire)  21st Century Wire SPECIAL REPORTDAMASCUS   According to two reports coming out of Aleppo today, at least 14 US Coalition military officers were captured this morning in an East Aleppo bunker by Syrian Special Forces.This story was quietly leaked by Voltaire.net, who announced,  The Security Council is sitting in private on Friday, December 16, 2016, at 17:00 GMT, while NATO officers were arrested this morning by the Syrian Special Forces in a bunker in East Aleppo. Fares Shehabi MP, a prominent Syrian Parliamentarian and head of Aleppo s Chamber of Commerce published the names of the Coalition officers on his Facebook page on the 15th December (emphasis added):Mutaz Kano lu   Turkey David Scott Winer   USA David Shlomo Aram   Israel Muhamad Tamimi   Qatar Muhamad Ahmad Assabian   Saudi Abd-el-Menham Fahd al Harij   Saudi Islam Salam Ezzahran Al Hajlan   Saudi Ahmed Ben Naoufel Al Darij   Saudi Muhamad Hassan Al Sabihi   Saudi Hamad Fahad Al Dousri   Saudi Amjad Qassem Al Tiraoui   Jordan Qassem Saad Al Shamry   Saudi Ayman Qassem Al Thahalbi   Saudi Mohamed Ech-Chafihi El Idrissi   MoroccanListen to Fares Shehabi s interview on the Sunday Wire radio show: Liberation Aleppo In addition to Voltaire.net, the other original report was provided by Damascus-based Syrian journalist Said Hilal Alcharifi. According to Alcharifi, captured  NATO  officers were from a number of member states including the US, France, Germany and Turkey, as well as Israel. Here is his statement (translated from French):   Thanks to information received, Syrian authorities discovered the headquarters of high ranking western/NATO officers in the basement of an area in East Aleppo and have captured them alive. Some names have already been given to Syrian journalists, myself included. The nationalities are US, French, British, German, Israeli, Turkish, Saudi, Moroccan, Qatari etc. In light of their nationalities and their rank, I assure you that the Syrian government have a very important catch, which should enable them to direct negotiations with the countries that have tried to destroy them. Although these initial reports describe the individuals in question as  NATO  officers, it s unlikely they would have been carrying NATO colors on a covert operation   and might be more accurately labeled as US Coalition officers. Note that early reports suggest that these are not standard  street rebel  or jihadi terrorists but actual Coalition military personnel and field commanders.SEE ALSO: The REAL Syria Civil Defence Exposes Fake  White Helmets  as Terrorist-Linked Imposters21WIRE also received unconfirmed reports yesterday that militants had fired a missile into the  Ramousa area and then tried, unsuccessfully, to get cars out of East Aleppo. It s possible this incident could be related to today reports of captured western operatives.This report from the Syrian Arab News Agency (emphasis added): The agreement on evacuating militants and weapons from the eastern neighborhoods of Aleppo city has been suspended after terrorist groups breached it, special sources told SANA correspondent in Aleppo.The sources said that the suspension of the agreement will remain in place until obtaining guarantees that oblige the terrorist groups to abide by all the agreement s provisions, stressing on the Syrian side s full adherence to the agreement and its keenness to end the bloodshed and restore security and stability to the entire city of Aleppo. Earlier, SANA reporter said that the terrorist groups have breached the agreement as they smuggled heavy weapons, including TOW missiles, heavy machineguns and kidnapped people via the buses and cars transporting terrorists and their families towards the southwestern countryside of Aleppo city.The reporter added that the terrorist groups fired shells and sniper bullets on the buses and ambulances at al-Ramousseh crossing, noting that the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) which are supervising the evacuation process had to withdraw all buses and cars from the crossing.Over the past 24 hours, some 8079 terrorists and members of their families were evacuated via busses and ambulances from the neighborhoods of Salah-Eddin, al-Ansari, al-Mashhad and al-Zibdiyeh to the southwest countryside of Aleppo city If true, this latest news would also mean that both the Syrian and Russian governments would have additional leverage going forward in any bilateral negotiations with the US-led Coalition.If, however, this story is kept under wraps by NATO member governments and is summarily blacked out by the US and European media outlets, then it might indicate that a deal has been struck, albeit behind the scenes, for the return of captured NATO operatives in exchange for other concessions.If today s report from East Aleppo is accurate, this might also help explain the hysterical behavior by the US State Department and western UN officials who have been demanding  an immediate ceasefire    despite the fact that 99% of East Aleppo has already been liberated by Syrian government forces.The western establishment hysterical reactions to Al Nusra s defeat in Aleppo have included wild claims that the Syrian Army had  unleashed death squads,  on its own residents in East Aleppo and were openly  executing women and children in the street,  and  burning children in the street,  as well what appear to be more fictional reports circulated in US media mainly by Michael Weiss of The Daily Beast via CNN, claiming that Syrian Army was committing  mass rape  against residents of East Aleppo. His article entitled,  Women in Aleppo Choose Suicide Over Rape, Rebels Report,  made a number of outlandish claims including: Activists and rebels in the besieged city say mass executions have begun and children are burned alive as Assad s Iranian- and Russian-backed forces move in. Not surprisingly, aside from unnamed  UN sources , Weiss claims to have received his information from none other than the discredited US and UK-financed pseudo NGO  known as the White Helmets.SEE ALSO: Tulsi Gabbard Introduces Bill to Stop US Government Funding and Arming Jihadist Terrorists in SyriaBack in September, numerous reports suggested that a western command center located behind terrorist-held lines had been targeted and destroyed by a Russian missile strike. Prof Michel Chossudovsky wrote: The US and its allies had  established a Field Operations Room in the Aleppo region integrated by intelligence personnel. Until it was targeted by a Russian missile attack on September 20,  this  semi-secret  facility was operated by US, British, Israeli, Turkish, Saudi and Qatari intelligence personnel.   This report was neither admitted, nor was it denied by US Coalition sources at the time. However, one mainstream Israeli source, The Times of Israel, did report the incident.For anyone who has been paying close attention to the Syrian Conflict, seeing NATO special forces or  contractors  working with  rebel  or terrorist fighters inside of Syria is nothing unusual. Numerous reports have been filed of British soldiers assigned to fighting groups to help with training, strategy and logistics. In June 2016, The Telegraph admitted that British special forces were helping one rebel group,   with logistics, like building defences to make the bunkers safe, said one  rebel  fighter. Other reports, including the LA Times which detailed CIA operations used to arm militants, including Al Nusra Front (al Qaeda in Syria) who were the terrorist force in charge in East Aleppo. Other revelations of US covert involvement include The New York Times, and also information on US (NATO by another name only) covert operations provided to the Wall Street Journal.South Front also notes: Earlier in December, SF already noted that the US despearate attempts to push a  diplomatic solution  in Aleppo could indicate that the Obama administration stalling for time to extricate US mercenaries and special service members from the Aleppo pocket: Considering that US-led coalition military advisers have been widely operating across Syria, training and assisting to the so-called  moderate opposition  openly linked with al-Qaeda, the recently appeared reports are likely true.For instance, British military advisers have officially arrived to Syria to restore combat capability of the  moderate  opposition, retreated from Aleppo 21WIRE can also point out that throughout fighting in the Donbass in eastern Ukraine, during the period of May 2014 to the present, numerous incidents have been reported where NATO military soldiers and operatives have been both spotted, and captured by rebel forces, and in most cases these reports have been muted, more than likely because of  horse trading  taking place as an extension of wider diplomacy.Contributors to this report were Patrick Henningsen and Vanessa Beeley.STAY TUNED FOR MORE  UPDATES .

23099,Facebook Partners With Snopes & Other So-Called ‘Fact Checking’ Sites to Burry ‘Fake News’,"21st Century Wire says Facebook is partnering with Snopes.com and other sites which have apparently been unofficially deemed the new ministries of truth to decide what is and what is not  Fake News.  Do we trust these agencies more than we trust the intelligence of 21WIRE Facebook followers to discern, on their own, what is  Fake News  and what is credible  Absolutely not.You decide: Is Facebook really cracking down on fake news or is it making it easier for the establishment to burry stories from one of the most widely used sources of news link sharing on the internet? Alex Heath Business InsiderFacebook is going to start fact checking, labeling, and burying fake news and hoaxes in the News Feed, the company announced on Thursday.The decision comes after Facebook received heated criticism for its role in spreading a deluge of political misinformation during the U.S. presidential election, like one story that falsely said the Pope had endorsed Donald Trump.To combat fake news, Facebook has partnered with a shortlist of media organizations, including Snopes and ABC News, that are part of an international fact-checking network led by Poynter, a nonprofit school for journalism located in St. Petersburg, Florida.Starting as a test with a small percentage of its users in the United States, Facebook will make it easier to report news stories that are fake or misleading. Once third-party fact checkers have confirmed that the story is fake, it will be labeled as such and demoted in the News Feed.A company spokesperson told Business Insider that the social network will also use other signals, like algorithms that detect whether a story that appears fake is going viral, to determine if it should label the story as fake and bury it in peoples  feeds. We ve focused our efforts on the worst of the worst, on the clear hoaxes spread by spammers for their own gain, and on engaging both our community and third party organizations,  Facebook News Feed chief Adam Mosseri said in a company blog post on Thursday.A team of Facebook researchers will also review website domains and send sites that appear to be fake or spoofed (like  washingtonpost.co ) to third-party fact checkers, a Facebook spokesperson said. Of the 42 news organizations that have committed to Poynter s fact-checking code of ethics, Facebook is starting out with the following four Snopes, Factcheck.org, ABC News, and PolitiFact. We are only involved to the extent that Facebook relies on the list of signatories to our code of principles as a starting point for the organizations it chooses to verify,  a Poynter spokesperson told Business Insider.  Facebook is the only organization certifying third party fact-checkers on its platform. Facebook has given its four initial fact-checking partners access to a tool that will let them label stories in the News Feed as fake, a Facebook spokesperson said.

23101,Obama Joins Comedy Central Host to Push ‘Laughable’ Establishment Conspiracy Theory on DNC Leaks,"21st Century Wire says President Obama is once again appearing on  info-tainment  programming on Comedy Central but his appearance is clearly not to entertain or inform the viewer. In the final days of the President s time in office he is going on comedy shows to push the  Russian hack  effect on the U.S. Presidential election outcome. He does so without a shred of evidence nor a mention of the Podesta emails, the collusion of the media with the Clinton campaign or the questionable practices of the Clinton Foundation.The Duran asks some good questions and provides further analysis  Alex Christoforou The DuranObama has gone all in to blame Russia for Hillary Clinton s loss and the DNC hack that exposed Hillary Clinton for the corrupt cheat that we all knew, deep down inside, she truly was.Notice how Obama talks only about the DNC hack and not the Wikileaks Podesta email leak. Also notice how Obama tries to justify his conveniently timed call for an investigation, by throwing it back onto Donald Trump.Obama never states that he has irrefutable evidence that Russia hacked the DNC emails, and never even mentions once the Podesta emails We determined and announced in October that it was the consensus of all the Intelligence agencies in law enforcement that organizations affiliated with Russian intelligence were responsible for the hacking of the DNC materials that were being leaked. FYI China, Israel, Germany, etc  also hack US institutions. US intelligence agencies hack governments all over the world.Obama s above assertions are based on James Clapper s statement that The Duran reported on in October consider the statement US intelligence published last week on the subject of alleged Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and of other US agencies involved in the election. It reads as follows: The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there.We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities. (bold italics added)The statement is an implicit admission that US intelligence has no evidence to back its allegations of Russian hacking.It is merely  confident    not  sure    that it is the Russians who are behind the hacking, and it is clear from the statement that it arrived at this conclusion purely through inference: because the hacks supposedly were  consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts .US intelligence assumes the Russians were behind the hack not because it knows this to be so but in part because of what it believes Russian motives to be.The statement backs its claim with a textual trick.  It says  the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia .  It then immediately follows these words with the words  for example .These lead to the expectation that an actual example of such Russian  tactics and techniques  is about to follow. Instead what is provided are the fact free words  to influence public opinion there .The words  for example  lend nothing to the meaning of the statement, which would be exactly the same without them.  These two words as used in the statement are actually meaningless.   That is a sure sign that their presence in the statement is intended to confuse the casual reader, and that this is true of the statement as a whole.The words are designed to create a subliminal impression to a casual reader that the Russians have been caught doing this sort of thing before, without however providing a single actual example when this was the case.Demonstrating how thin the case of Russian government actually is, the statement then goes on to say: Some states have also recently seen scanning and probing of their election-related systems, which in most cases originated from servers operated by a Russian company. However, we are not now in a position to attribute this activity to the Russian Government. (bold italics added)In other words US intelligence admits the mere fact servers operated by a Russian company may have been used for  scanning and probing    and presumably also for hacking   is not in itself proof of the involvement of the Russian government.The Daily Show s Trevor Noah, who is not a journalist, and not even American, is the perfect useful idiot to conduct this interview and help spread Obama s political spin.No tough question, no follow up questions just giggly gushing glances of admiration and awe from Noah.Remember when Obama told Trump to  stop whining  about a rigged election and focus on  getting votes. This was when Obama, and the entire Hillary liberal elite establishment, were certain that Trump had no chance to win the US Presidency.How things change, and how Obama is now changing his tune doing everything in his power to undermine Trump and undermine US Democracy, while risking escalating, already high tensions with Russia.Continue reading this story at The DuranREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"December 15, 2016"

23103,Is Democratic Party Attempting a ‘Soft Coup’? Efforts Underway to Hijack Electoral College Vote…," 21st Century Wire says This latest episode of the Democratic Party s epic meltdown is perhaps the most embarrassing of them all. The ghosts of Hillary s defeat continue to haunt the halls of Washington and media headlines, as party operatives and their media surrogates conjure up old plots, as well as new and innovative ways to change the election results.Since Hillary Clinton s devastating defeat at the hands of underdog Republican nominee, and now President-Elect, Donald Trump, both the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party leadership have been desperately trying to claw-back the election result, or at least damage and delegitimize the incoming Trump Administration. After blaming FBI Director James Comey for Clinton s loss, party operatives, in conjunction with George Soros-backed MoveOn.org, then went on to organize street protests which turned into riots, before backing Green Party leader Jill Stein in her frantic attempt to stage a voter recount in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania   all designed to somehow reverse, or discredit Trump s historic presidential win.The only problem with this leg of the Establishment s subscribed conspiracy theory   is that it is based on a lie. Media hype aside   there is no actual evidence, beyond speculation that Russia hacked US Elections, or even hacked Clinton chief of staff John Podesta s emails posted on Wikileaks. That lie is evident right there plain sight, as Democratic Party leaders falsely state that the CIA has concluded the  Russians  hacked or interfered in the US Presidential election. The CIA never concluded anything, they simply said  the Russians probably did it.  Regardless, here s what Democrats are putting out as their lead talking point: We now know that the CIA has determined Russia s interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump. This should distress every American.  (see full letter below).Despite the lack of any actual proof, the same Clinton media operatives that skewed campaign coverage, polling in their candidate s favor, and who also fabricated Trump scandals throughout the election   are now running a hysterical PR campaign  are pushing the Russian hacking conspiracy theory  with absolutely no proof to substantiate their incredible claims.Desperate to rescue his collapsed reputation, John Podesta, along with Democrat minority leader Nancy Pelosi (image, left) are now lobbying the CIA to release  evidence  it doesn t actually have   and give it to state delegate voters in the US Electoral College before they cast their official Presidential votes on December 19th.It seems as if disgraced party operative Podesta might just be digging a deeper hole for himself and his party The HillMore Democratic electors are joining the call for an intelligence briefing on Russian interference in the presidential election before they cast their votes for president on Monday.Twenty-nine electors now are pressuring Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to disclose more information about the CIA s conclusion that Russian interference helped sway the election in President-elect Donald Trump s favor.On Monday, 10 electors   spearheaded by Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.)   wrote an open letter to Clapper, demanding more information ahead of next week s vote. The Electors require to know from the intelligence community whether there are ongoing investigations into ties between Donald Trump, his campaign or associates, and Russian government interference in the election, the scope of those investigations, how far those investigations may have reached, and who was involved in those investigations,  the letter reads.  We further require a briefing on all investigative findings, as these matters directly impact the core factors in our deliberations of whether Mr. Trump is fit to serve as President of the United States. Twenty-eight Democrats and one Republican have now signed the letter.On Monday, the Clinton campaign voiced support for the effort. Each day that month, our campaign decried the interference of Russia in our campaign and its evident goal of hurting our campaign to aid Donald Trump,  said John Podesta, Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman, in a statement.  Despite our protestations, this matter did not receive the attention it deserved by the media in the campaign. We now know that the CIA has determined Russia s interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump. This should distress every American.

23104,CIA Claims of Russian Intervention in US Election Fall Flat,"21st Century Wire says How seriously can we take a  secret CIA assessment  that Russian intervention in the U.S. Presidential election played a role in the victory of President Elect Donald J. Trump when it comes from an organization that has intervened extensively in so many countries  sovereign governments?The Anti-Media The Daily SheepleAccording to a  secret CIA assessment,  Russia intervened in the U.S. election to undermine confidence in the electoral system and boost support for Donald Trump.The president-elect has already rejected this notion, though the implications of claims regarding Russian involvement are still unclear.Once again, this kind of pro-Clinton/anti-Russian-based narrative has already been completely debunked. For example, in his recent article,  Anonymous Leaks to the WashPost About the CIA s Russia Beliefs Are No Substitute for Evidence,  Glenn Greenwald brilliantly explains why this story does not merit our attention. He astutely notes: There is still no such evidence for any of these claims. What we have instead are assertions, disseminated by anonymous people, completely unaccompanied by any evidence, let alone proof. As a result, none of the purported evidence   still   can be publicly seen, reviewed, or discussed. Anonymous claims leaked to newspapers about what the CIA believes do not constitute proof, and certainly do not constitute reliable evidence that substitutes for actual evidence that can be reviewed.

23105,"CNN’s Hostile Treatment of Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard after revealing US are arming, funding Terrorists in Syria","21st Century Wire says Recently, Democrat Hawaii Congresswoman, Tulsi Gabbard, went on CNN s  The Lead  hosted by Jake Tapper, to talk about Donald Trump s foreign policy, and more importantly, to discuss the disturbing reality of US taxpayer support for armed militants and terrorists in places like Syria. Instead of adulation for doing the honorable thing, she received a hostile reaction from one of CNN s many highly paid onscreen propagandists. When asked by CNN s Jake Tapper (photo, right) about US Representative Tulsi Gabbard s recent visit to Trump Tower, she replied,  My goal in going there, in receiving the invitation to speak to President-elect Trump was to speak specifically about the situation in Syria, the dangerous consequences of escalating the regime change war that the United States is fuelling there along with countries like Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, and Turkey are escalating that through a so-called no-fly zone or safe zone. And urging him to end our regime change war there to stop funding both directly and indirectly groups that are working with Al Qaeda and ISIS. And to stop funneling those dollars and weapons and other assistance through these others countries like Saudi Arabia who are directly supporting these terrorist groups who are supposed to be our enemy, who we re supposed to be fighting to defeat. Visibly agitated by her answer, Tapper then asks Gabbard, herself an Iraq War veteran and a current member of the Hawaii National Guard, about her recent Bill introduced on the House floor last week entitled, the  Stop Arming Terrorists Act,  which proposes severe legal repercussions to any US officials or persons involved in the arming or funding, either directly or possibly indirectly, of terrorists overseas   including the US-backed  rebel  terrorists currently operating in Syria. What s key is that Gabbard points out that this activity is funded by the US taxpayer. Not surprisingly, CNN has never before reported this side of the clandestine issue before. Here s how their fascinating conversation transpired:TAPPER: And tell me about legislation. You have a bill that you introduced today that would address loopholes.GABBARD: Yes.TAPPER: You say have allowed American taxpayer dollars to fund terror groups such as Al Qaeda and ISIS in Syria. Are you   are you suggesting that the U.S. government is funding these terrorist groups?GABBARD: I m not only suggesting it. This is   this is the reality that we re living in.TAPPER: Not directly, though.GABBARD: Most Americans   you know, if you were   I were to go and provide money, weapons, or support or whatever to a group like Al Qaeda or ISIS, you would immediately be thrown in Jail. However, the U.S. government has been providing money, weapons, intel assistance and other types of support through the CIA, directly to these groups that are working with and are affiliated with Al Qaeda and ISIS.TAPPER: So, you re saying the CIA is giving money to groups in Syria, and those groups are working with Al-Nusra and ISIS.GABBARD: There are   there have been numerous reports from The New York Times to the Wall Street Journal and other news outlets who have declared that these rebel groups have formed these battlefield alliances with Al Qaeda, that essentially is Al Qaeda groups are in charge of every single rebel group on the ground fighting in Syria to overthrow the Syrian government.Tapper goes on to act stunned and befuddled, insinuating that Gabbard is  wrong    as if Gabbard were somehow making up her accusations, as he becomes somewhat confused trying to manage CNN s complicated contrived narrative. Tapper then insists that  Obviously, they (US-funded  rebel  terrorists) are all fighting Assad.  Gabbard quickly calls out Tapper s clear attempt at US State Dept propaganda talking points management Here s the latter exchange:TAPPER: And the U.S. government says they vet the groups that they give money to very, very closely. And that you re wrong, there are not alliances between groups at the American taxpayers fund and these other groups. Obviously, they all are fighting Assad.GABBARD: I beg to differ. Evidence has shown time and time again that that is not the case, that we are both directly and indirectly supporting these groups who are allied with or partnered with Al Qaeda and ISIS, in working to over throw the Syrian government of Assad. And we ve also been providing that support through countries like Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar to do that. Gabbard s brave new legislation might be the most important and explosive development regarding Syrian Foreign Policy in Washington, but instead of pursuing this discussion, CNN s Tapper predictably tried to change the subject to Michael Flynn instead.Watch this incredible exchange here: 21WIRE has reported previously on the possibility that CNN is serving as a media adjunct to either the State Department, the Pentagon, NSA or the CIA (or a combination of the four). Judging by Jake Tapper s dismissive reaction to the facts on the ground, and his attempt to discredit Gabbard live on air, only strengthens the case that CNN is peddling an agenda for those US departments and agencies.21WIRE also reported previously how CNN has clearly chosen to only air coverage favorable to what the network has claimed to be  rebels  in Syria, when in reality   these were mostly terrorist fighting groups. CNN s star reporter  Clarissa Ward even went so far as to characterize terrorist suicide bombers in a sympathetic manner in her reports   clearly designed to give positive PR to terrorists groups like Al Nusra Front who have been occupying East Aleppo since 2012. Other actors in the field seemingly employed by CNN who are operating in clear support of terrorists in East Aleppo include one Bilal Abdul Karim an apparent US asset promoting jihadist extremism, together with Ward, producing what are clearly staged reports, alongside CNN s endless airing of unvetted, staged White Helmets imagery, passing it off to the viewing public as authentic video and photos supplied by nameless  Syria activists .  21WIRE has recently revealed additional terrorist-links with the White Helmets, who are a US State Dept, British Foreign Office and EU-funded pseudo NGO.Throughout the west s proxy war against Syria, CNN has only reported the rebel/terrorist perspective, shamelessly portraying militant terrorists as  moderate rebels  and freedom fighters, while systematically demonizing any Syrian or Russian who is defending the nation-state of Syria. This might explain Tapper s near contempt for Gabbard s accurate statements regarding US arming and funding of known terrorist groups in Syria.2016 was the year that CNN was exposed as perhaps the most corrupt mainstream media outlet in the United States. A number of other leaked emails revealed an unprecedented level of media corruption and systematic partisan collusion between operatives at CNN and the Hillary Clinton Campaign   a naked violation of every fundamental principle of nonobjective press practices. In the leaked email exchanges, one could see gleeful Clinton campaign officials boasting about getting favorable news coverage from compliant mainstream media  journalists    with CNN being perhaps the worst offender. Clinton staffers even went so far as to circulate names of journalists who were deemed  friendly  to their candidate.Among the notorious Wikileaks email dump was a CNN request to DNC staffers asking for questions to ask during a Wolf Blitzer interview with then GOP candidate Donald Trump.In another email on April 28, CNN operative Jason Seher, a writer for Jake Tapper s show  The Lead  on CNN, emailed DNC media coordinator Pablo Manriquez thanking him for working behind the scenes with CNN.In a separate conversation CNN s Seher, then thanked DNC insider Martinez for  facilitating Luis coming on today, and bearing with us through a meelee of GOP nonsense and cancellations and all that. Any particular points he ll want to make? We re gonna stay Dem focused Perhaps the worst CNN violation of press independence was when the network s supposed  chief political analyst , Gloria Borger, tried to get an interview with Clinton chief of staff John Podesta by assuring him of essentially softball questions. I know John will have an exalted place in the campaign, and would love to chat with him about HRC, in a general way, not in a gotcha way re HRC,  said Borger.  It would be about 10 mins, very general, about her as a person and a candidate. What is most amazing about all of this, is that CNN executives refused to consider firing any of their personalities who have been implicated in open collusion with the Democratic party during one of the most crucial political contests in US history.In another leak provided to The Intercept by the source known as Gucifer 2.0, other CNN reporters discovered on the DNC s  VIP List  of media operatives counted on by the Clinton campaign included Kate Bouldan, Brianna Kielar, Jeff Zeleny, Sam Feist, David Chalian, John Berman, and Mark Preston.The only person who lost their paid position with CNN was the now disgraced political operative, Donna Brazile, currently still holding onto her gifted position as interim Chairwoman of the DNC   who was also moonlighting for extra cash as  contributor  for CNN. Brazile was also a Super Delegate for Hillary Clinton. Podesta Email dumps exposed the fact that Brazile, a CNN contributor was caught giving Hillary s campaign debate questions in advance of CNN s Town Hall debate event.As a result, CNN s reputation as a trustworthy media outlets has been held in question by most of the public.When it comes to coverage of both the 2016 Election and the Syrian War, CNN has been on the wrong side of history   and should not be trusted to give accurate and fair reporting regarding serious and important issues.

23106,Top US Spy Agency Refuses to Endorse CIA’s ‘Russian Hacking’ Assessment Due to “Lack Of Evidence”,"21st Century Wire says If anyone still thinks this whole  Russian hacking  plot is not motivated by internal US politics   think again Tyler Durden Zero HedgeWhen the WaPo posted last Friday s story about a  secret  CIA assessment that Russian cyber attacks were aimed at helping Republican President-elect Donald Trump win the 2016 election, the readers of the Bezos-owned publication took it as gospel, despite, as we promptly noted, there being no evidence provided by the CIA, and as we learned today, the FBI openly resisting the CIA s assessment. It now appears that once again the WaPo may have been engaging in  partial fake news , as it did with its Nov. 24 story about  Russian propaganda fake media. According to Reuters, the so-called overseers of the U.S. intelligence community as it supervises the 17 agency-strong U.S. intelligence community, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), while not disputing the CIA s analysis of Russian hacking operations   something which would be unprecedented for the US spy industry and would telegraph just how partisan and broken the country s intelligence apparatus has become   has refused to endorse the CIA s assessment  because of a lack of conclusive evidence  that Moscow intended to boost Trump over Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.As Reuters conveniently notes, the ODNI position could give Trump fresh ammunition to dispute the CIA assessment, which he rejected as  ridiculous  in weekend remarks, and press his assertion that no evidence implicates Russia in the cyber attacks. The ODNI s position confirms that Trump was once again, you guessed it, right. ODNI is not arguing that the agency (CIA) is wrong, only that they can t prove intent,  said one of the three U.S. officials Continue this story at Zero HedgeREAD MORE RUSSIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Russia Files",Middle-east,"December 13, 2016"
23107,‘Common Cause’? Barbra Streisand lobbying Obama to bypass US Senate and appoint Supreme Court Justice unilaterally,"21st Century Wire says Three weeks ago, while the wounds were still fresh following Hillary Clinton s epic electoral collapse, a number of frustrated Hollywood celebrities floated various reactionary and often flippant ideas. As liberal elites and their student acolytes accused President-Elect Donald J. Trump of being a  fascist , Hollywood elites were themselves pushing actual fascist directives, the worst of which had to be singer Barbra Streisand s insistence that lame duck president Barack Obama bypass the US Senate and appoint a liberal Supreme Court Justice unilaterally. If this episode demonstrates anything, it shows how Hollywood s liberal celebrity elites would govern if, god forbid, they were ever in power.Streisand has been pushing via her Facebook page a White House petition entitled We the People calling for Obama to appoint Merrick Garland by executive action   and without any Senate confirmation or due process. Obama had previously nominated Garland, a chief justice of the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, to fill the seat of Justice Antonin Scalia, who died suddenly last winter. Underlining the current partisan feud during this election year, Senate Republicans refused to hold hearings or vote on his nomination.It appears that Streisand is working in coordination with a radical left-wing George Soros-funded  change agent  NGO called Common Cause, whose board member Gregory L. Diskant had initially worked with the Washington Post to launch their the campaign in the national media.Here s what the ever controversial pundit, the Doctor of Common Sense  E.T. Williams had this to say about Hollywood s attempted hostile takeover of the US Supreme Court, and celebrities who had threatened to leave the US if Trump won the election  ",Middle-east,"December 12, 2016"

23109,SUNDAY SCREENING: 24 Hours After Hiroshima (2010),"21st Century Wire says This week s documentary film curated by our editorial team at 21WIRE. By August 1945, the Allied Manhattan Project had successfully detonated an atomic device in the New Mexico desert and subsequently produced atomic weapons based on two alternate designs. The 509th Composite Group of the U.S. Army Air Forces was equipped with a Silverplate Boeing B-29 Superfortress that could deliver them from Tinian in the Mariana Islands. In August 1945, during the final stage of the Second World War, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAsnaEM_Q8U .

23110,Tucker Carlson slams Vox.com over ‘Fake News’,"21st Century Wire says The mainstream media continues to deflect from its own collapse in credibility in the wake of Hillary Clinton s epic electoral meltdown by inventing a synthetic  fake news  crisis and scapegoating Clinton s loss on bloggers and cheap eastern European hoax websites. In addition to mainstream media constantly pushing out actual fake news, corporate media giants have also created their own fake  alternative media  as well. Here are a number of media operatives appearing on TV pretending to be  alternative media  but in reality are really funded by the major broadcast media empires. One of these is a political news website called Vox.com. It s designed to look like an edgy  alternative  news source, but in reality, Vox is just another establishment consensus reality-building tool. Silicon Valley investors have pumped tens of millions of dollars into this media outlet, with the lead investor being none other than NBC Universal   who are one of the biggest peddlers of actual fake news globally (just ask their phony news anchor Brian Williams). Watch as FOX host Tucker Carlson takes apart hypocritical Vox staffer Timothy Lee over the issue of  fake news  circulating on the internet, revealing how Vox is also a producer of  fake news  too. As Carlson rightly points out   this issue really boils down to freedom of speech.Caveat: Certainly, FOX News is not immune to pushing their own brand of fake news, especially when it comes to promoting US wars overseas, but it does have a number of capable pundits who have exposed a number of key revelations during the course of  this historic 2016 Election.

23111,"CNN Fake News vs Real News: First Images of Abandoned Terrorist Facilities in East Aleppo, Not From CNN"," This week, the momentum in Syria shifted dramatically as the Syrian Army liberated the Old City in eastern Aleppo, so far retaking 80% of  rebel -held areas in the city. As a result, operatives in Washington and their allies are now taking desperate measures in order to try and preserve the viability of remaining terrorist forces on the ground   in the hopes of extending Syria s five year bloody conflict and overthrowing the legal government in Damascus. 21WIRE will post more ALEPPO UPDATES as new information comes in The Western mainstream media continue to give a twisted picture of reality in Aleppo.During CNN s coverage of newly liberated areas of East Aleppo on Wednesday afternoon, CNN anchor Kate Bolduan (who cried profusely over staged  Dusty Boy  Omran image) spoke to her correspondent Fred Pleitgen by telephone (offering no real images, so it s impossible to verify if Pleitgen was actually in East Aleppo as CNN claimed, more than likely he was not), and Bolduan refers to Pleitgen as  the first western journalist inside East Aleppo,  which is in itself a lie, as RT s Lizzie Phelan (who is British and therefore western) was already reporting from the East-West green line in Aleppo since late Monday.CNN was characterizing the liberation of East Aleppo as a  humanitarian disaster  as theatrical Bolduan then gushes at the end of the segment to Pleitgen, another polemic along the lines of,  Thank you Fred, it s so great we have brave journalists like you to show the world what s really going on  All that after CNN has, for the last 4 years straight, been spinning and completely misrepresenting events on the ground, and presenting reports by Clarissa Ward which appear to glorify terroist suicide bombers and various  rebel  terrorists (Al Nusra, Arar al-Sham, Nour al-din al-Zenki et all) occupying east Aleppo, effectively giving additional PR support to al Nusra-led efforts. Ward is flanked by another US asset promoting jihadist extremism, Bilal Abdul Karim, together producing what are clearly staged reports, alongside CNN s endless airing of unvetted, staged White Helmets imagery   and passing it off to the viewing public as authentic video and photos supplied by nameless Syrian activists . Throughout the west s proxy war against Syria, CNN has only reported the rebel/terrorist perspective, shamelessly portraying militant terrorists as  moderate rebels  and freedom fighters, while systematically demonizing any Syrian or Russian who is defending the nation state of Syria.  Unlike CNN s intentionally skewed US State Dept-slanted propaganda (eg. fake news), the following reports by RT s Phelan, and R&U Vids, is real. The following footage is stunning, and very revealing . Battles continue between pro-government forces and rebels in Aleppo s Old City, with Damascus slowly winning back territory. RT s Lizzie Phelan and her crew were the first journalists to visit the neighborhoods just captured by the government.  Watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKmVqKVIB4M . The following is more footage of the Syrian Army advancing through the streets of East Aleppo. You can see multiple flags and insignias of listed terrorist fighting groups, once more proving that extremist terrorists forces   not  moderate rebels , had full operational control over East Aleppo.

23112,LAME DUCK: New Obama Executive Action Opens Door to Unlimited Arms for Salafist Terrorists in Syria,"Patrick Henningsen 21st Century Wire As 21WIRE reported earlier this week, in a historic turning point in a five-year bloody conflict, the Syrian Arab Army liberated the Old City of Aleppo from the hands of occupying terrorists and armed militants. This joint victory by Syria and Russia has caused a panic in Washington, however, as well as in London, Paris, Saudi Arabia and Qatar   all of whom hoped they would eventually destroy the entire city of Aleppo, and win their proxy war in the process. Prior to this week, the US-led  Coalition  still believed that they could somehow force a Syria-Russia military pause, and UN-enforced No Fly Zone or  Safe Zone    by continuing to back a militant opposition that has been occupying East Aleppo since 2012. Their epic failure has prompted yet another highly dangerous and desperate move by a lame duck US President   signing a new order which could deliver unlimited arms and support to  moderate terrorists in Syria. On Tuesday, President Barack Obama issued a White House memorandum (see full text below) to both the US State and Defense departments which waives any arms export control restrictions on providing  military assistance  to any and all  foreign forces  in Syria, according to a White House press release issued today. Presumably, this includes not only guns and ammunition, but also lethal TOW Missiles and RPGs (and anti-aircraft units?) for tens of thousands of extremist foreign fighters and Salafi terrorists currently operating inside Syria, as well as thousands of  US-trained and equipped fighters waiting in camp in both Turkey and Jordan.Not coincidentally, this comes on the same day the US Senate passed a defense bill by a majority vote of 92-7, which authorizes $611 billion in military spending through 2017.Although in 2016 the US allocated some $500 million in US taxpayer funds in order to  train and equip (arm) the so-called moderate rebels  in Syria via the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), it s still difficult to determine what is the total cost to date of Washington s support, both overt and covert, for rebel factions in Syria.This seemingly desperate move by Obama can only mean two things. Firstly, it demonstrates that the US and its allies are doggedly determined to prolong one of the bloodiest and dirtiest wars in recent history. Secondly, it signals a last-ditch act of desperation on the part of a President who will be viewed as a perennial loser in a failed proxy war that lasted over 5 years, costing tens of billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of lives.The executive action also gives additional weight to this week s statement by US State Dept spokesperson Elizabeth Trudeau who stated: Even if Aleppo falls, certainly the war is not over. But our position has not changed on that. Is the outgoing White House trying to plunge the next Administration into a deeper commitment to an unwinnable proxy war in the Middle East?As far as diplomacy is concerned, the agenda couldn t be clearer. This is an all-too-familiar pattern that we ve become used to throughout Washington s endless Syria debacle. While Kerry pretends to negotiate a diplomatic ceasefire or  peace deal  over the table somewhere in Europe, operatives in Washington execute some irrational moves under the table specifically designed to sabotage any real bilateral agreement. Whether it s an US air strike against Syrian Army, a fabricated chemical weapons claim against the Syrian armed forces, or a false flag attack on a UN Aid Convoy the US seems to always pull a trick card when the promise of an agreement is near.According to RT reports from today s OECD talks in Hamburg, Germany, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov (image, right) hit back at a recent allegation made by US State Department spokesman Mark Toner who had accused Russia of not actually fighting Jabhat al-Nusra (Al Nusra) terrorists in Syria, but rather that Russia was instead attacking the US-backed  moderate opposition.  Lavrov replied simply by stating, As for Jabhat al-Nusra, the US is not only not touching it, but also tried to negotiate our agreements in a way which let al-Nusra remain unpunished.  He then explained that this group is listed by the UN as a designated terrorist organization, adding that, surely, we cannot accept it. Washington s  name game  of refusing to call a terrorist a terrorist should be old hat by now. Back in September, Lavrov had managed to get US Secretary of State John Kerry to agree to target leading terrorist opposition force Al Nusra Front (al Qaeda in Syria, supported covertly by both the Saudi Arabia and the US/CIA), but this and other provisional ceasefire arrangements quickly collapsed after the US targeted and killed at least 70 Syrian Army soldiers   a brutal operation which allowed ISIS forces to advance towards the key city of Deir el-Zour. This prompted a rather embarrassing public tantrum by Washington s UN Ambassador Samantha Power.Meanwhile, there was a near complete media blackout and no real national discussion over the Stop Arming Terrorists Act introduced by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), which would prohibit the U.S. government from using American taxpayer dollars to provide funding, weapons, training, and intelligence support to groups like Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, al Nusra, al-Qaeda and ISIS, or to countries who are providing direct or indirect support to those same groups, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and also Israel (see Israeli support for al Qaeda). Not surprisingly, most US Congressmen and Senators oppose such a move   which speaks volumes as to the level of corruption present in Washington today.Once again, Washington drives another impossible wedge into delicate diplomatic negotiations Obama s latest decree stipulates that new arms shipments and military provisions will fall under the banner of  fighting terrorism,  (see the official document below) when in reality, the stated US intention and policies regarding supplying weapons to  moderate opposition Syria who have never actually fought ISIS. Instead, weapons are transferred to armed opposition paramilitaries (including listed Terrorist groups like Al Nusra Front and its numerous affiliates, and even into the hands of ISIS themselves). In reality, these US Coalition-supplied militants are really fighting against the Syrian Army   and not ISIS, and they do so with the expressed intention of overthrowing the Syrian Government led by President Bashar al-Assad. This same regime change is also the stated policy of the US and its allies, and yet Washington is still carrying on with its political charade regardless.Here is the Presidential Memorandum posted on the White House website this afternoon:Presidential Determination and Waiver   Pursuant to Section 2249a of Title 10, United States Code, and Sections 40 and 40A of the Arms Export Control Act to Support U.S. Special Operations to Combat Terrorism in SyriaDecember 8, 2016Presidential Determination No. 2017-05MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSESUBJECT: Presidential Determination and Waiver Pursuant to Section 2249a of Title 10, United States Code, and Sections 40 and 40A of the Arms Export Control Act to Support U.S. Special Operations to Combat Terrorism in SyriaBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 2249a of title 10, United States Code, sections 40 and 40A of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) (22 U.S.C. 2780 and 2781), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby:The Secretary of Defense is authorized and directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.BARACK OBAMA [signed]***During recent peace negotiations in Rome and Hamburg, Sergey Lavrov made it clear that past Washington attempts to deliberately obfuscate and confuse the issue would not work this time   which has no doubt infuriated Washington who has always reserved the right to pull a bait-and-switch, or simply lie its way through negotiations   either to buy time for terrorist ground forces, or simply to railroad any actual agreement before the signing stage. This was certainly the case over the weekend in Rome when, according to RT, Lavrov emphasised that, John Kerry passed on to us proposals from Washington that are in line with the suggestions [on Syria] from Russia s experts.   Then, like clockwork, Washington withdrew the proposal two days later.Accustomed to US double-dealing over Syria, Lavrov seemed to take it stride, saying on Tuesday, They have withdrawn their document and have a new one. Our initial impression is that this new document backtracks, and is an attempt to buy time for the militants, allow them to catch their breath and resupply. Lavrov also chided the UN special envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, to stop sabotaging the Geneva Syria peace talks.Meanwhile, terrorist-occupied East Aleppo was liberated by Government forces. That was Washington s last card in Aleppo, and now it s gone. WESTERN DOUBLESPEAK:  Moderate Rebels  in Syria. Despite now Washington s farcical legal evasion claiming how it is shipping arms into Syria in order to help the long-defunct, albeit aspirational construct, the  Free Syrian Army,  in the supposed  fight against ISIS,  bureaucrats can no longer hide their true intentions. It should also be noted that by arming internationally recognized terrorists fighters   Washington and any other allies involved in these illicit operations   are in direct violation of United States Anti-Terrorism laws, as well as similar European and international laws. However, because this has been a bipartisan effort from the beginning, co-steered by key Republicans including John McCain, Ed Royce, and Mike Rogers   no such indictments may ever be brought against Washington s criminal weapons traffickers. If such a case were ever prosecuted, then every US politician involved in this operation, both Democrat and Republican as well as agency officials, could, in theory, be charged with providing material support and lethal aid to known terrorist entities. Perhaps for this reason, the US and its allies have avoided specifically naming Al Nusra Front and its terror affiliates in most of the language in their official pronouncements of  rebel  support.RT dispatches added the following statement on Wednesday from retired US Army Colonel Larry Wilkerson, who is urging Washington DC to end the spilling of blood in Syria, citing that all western attempts to oust Assad have failed: There is an old theory in international relations that some wars have to be won. Well, this is one that has been won and it has been won by Assad and his allies,  Wilkerson said. The official elaborated that the West should  recognize that to stop the killing, to stop the slaughter, to stop the bloodshed. Stability in this case is better than what we have right now. It would be the same in Libya. We opened Pandora s box in Libya too and look what we have now. Since attempts to drive out the legitimate Syrian President have failed, the international community needs to  make accommodation with him [Assad] We need to bring some stability back to Syria,  Wilkerson concluded.Only two days ago, on the anniversary of Pearl Harbor, President Obama could be seen grandstanding, and boasting about all of his supposed  security  achievements at a speech he gave at CENTCOM HQ at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida. On January 20th, I will become the first president of the United States to serve two full terms during a time of war.  he said.What Obama seems to forget is that all of his wars were done in absence of any real Article One Section 8 declaration of war by US Congress, only a vague  Authorization of Force rubber-stamp was applied. This is nothing more than an expedient lawyer s end-run around the US Constitution. From Iraq, to Afghanistan, to Libya, to Syria, and Yemen (not to mention covert actions in the Ukraine)   all of these are undeclared wars of aggression, for which Germany was also implicated over its actions from 1939, which was also the basis for the draft text in the Nuremberg Principles.The NYT adds:  He [Obama] defended an approach to fighting wars that did not bankrupt the Treasury or cause thousands of deaths. He noted, for instance, that he has spent $10 billion over the last two years fighting the Islamic State   the same amount of money President George W. Bush spent in just one month fighting the Iraq War. So right after he brags to a crowd of hapless US servicemen about how he defeated ISIS on the cheap, Obama signs a blank check to arm legions of murdering terrorists already running amok in Syria.Is this the final act of a President who fears that his all-important legacy is slipping away in the waning weeks of his own eight year regime?Obama s legacy is written already, however.

23114,Strange: Trump ‘Internet Takeover’ Fear Story Calls For Canada to Manage Net Archive,"21st Century Wire says A red flag went up when we saw this story. We ll let you decide what you think this is Brewster Kahle (photo, left), co-founder of Archive.org, one of the internet s permanent default archive sources, said last week,  On 9 November in America, we woke up to a new administration promising radical change,  and went on to sound the alarm for Americans to create a  safe back-up  of the Archive  in neighboring Canada (see IBT story below).In actuality, there has been no policy talk of a  internet crackdown  by the incoming Trump Administration, so where is this talking point coming from, and what does this really mean?Looking past the obvious partisan rhetoric, is this a signal by the Establishment that Canada (British Commonwealth) might be taking over the management of the internet s archive? Another step towards globalization?Aside from the fact that Kahle is opportunistically using an off-handed campaign comment by Trump to drive his latest fundraising appeal, his comments are ill-informed and misleading for other reasons. Granted, Donald Trump made a number of wild and incendiary statements on the campaign trail, and certainly we have seen many people in politics and media taking each of those comments literally, and even inflating them for their own political ends. However, the facts show that internet freedom and state authoritarian policies are not issues limited to any one political figure, or party. State control and attacks on the internet have steadily increased over the last 16 years by both the Bush AND Obama Administrations   as members of BOTH parties try to push through new corporate control measures like SOPA, PIPA, ACTA and CISPA, but also across the board efforts to increase warrantless wire-tapping and data collection of all America citizens, as well a foreign ones too.So why single out Trump as the rally cry to move operations north to Canada?The culture in Canadian politics is very much towards globalist power arrangements. Canada is a major backer of TPP and TTIP. We ve already seen Establishment moves to move a number of key internet functions offshore and into transnational corporate hands, specifically with the International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN. Here we see a crucial internet function being pushed into the realm of impersonal TPP and TTIP transnational corporate regimes. Make no mistake, the TPP agenda and the ICANN debate are absolutely linked.Consider this. As of October 3, 2016, ICANN seems to have left US public hands, into a transnational collective: At midnight Saturday the United States ceded control of the Internet s address system when the management contract between the Department of Commerce and the non-profit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)  expired. Since 1998  ICANN has run the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) function that approves domain names such as .com, .ca, .gov and others. Is state, or corporate control of internet and free speech rights any better in Canada, or in its British Commonwealth overlord the UK? This is where it gets worrying. The Verge reports,  The UK is about to become one of the world s foremost surveillance states, allowing its police and intelligence agencies to spy on its own people to a degree that is unprecedented for a democracy. The UN s privacy chief has called the situation  worse than scary.  Edward Snowden says it s simply  the most extreme surveillance in the history of western democracy. The legislation in question is called the Investigatory Powers Bill. It s been cleared by politicians and granted royal assent on November 29th   officially becoming law. The bill will legalize the UK s global surveillance program, which scoops up communications data from around the world, but it will also introduce new domestic powers, including a government database that stores the web history of every citizen in the country. UK spies will be empowered to hack individuals, internet infrastructure, and even whole towns   if the government deems it necessary. Presumably, and like everything in its Mother Kingdom, Canadian political elites are completely on board with all of that. Moreover, Canada s own bourgeoning police state is very real indeed.Americans should be extra skeptical of any talk of Canada as some uptopian cyber-safehaven. Perhaps it s a better idea that Americans get engaged with these important issues at home, and stand and fight for freedom inside the USA   and not capitulate by fleeing to Canada   which in the case of the internet, will only play into the hands of the globalists  Agamoni Ghosh International Business TimesThe Internet Archive, a US-based nonprofit digital library that preserves billions of webpages for historical record, is preparing to build a backup archive in Canada over fears of intrusion US President-elect Donald Trump. On 9 November in America, we woke up to a new administration promising radical change,  writes founder Brewster Kahle in a blog post.  It was a firm reminder that institutions like ours, built for the long-term, need to design for change. For us, it means keeping our cultural materials safe, private and perpetually accessible. It means preparing for a web that may face greater restrictions. It means serving patrons in a world in which government surveillance is not going away. The organisation, which relies heavily on grants and donations, is now asking for help from its loyal donors and others who would like to see the Internet Archive last forever without any censorship. This project will cost millions. So this is the one time of the year I will ask you: please make a tax-deductible donation to help make sure the Internet Archive lasts forever, writes Kahle.The organisation, which as of May 2014 had 15 petabytes (1000 terabytes) of data storage, provides free public access to collections of digitised materials. The archive stores web sites, software applications and games, music, movies, moving images and nearly three million public-domain books. Kahle says moving this humongous archive would protect it from efforts to take down specific content. The replica archive will also make it harder to request data on user activity by authorities.During his campaign, Trump had taken a rigid stance on internet censorship and even mentioned that the tech industry needs to  close that internet up  to stop the spread of extremism. Somebody will say,  Oh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech. These are foolish people,   he said earlier...Continue this story at IBTREAD MORE NET NEUTRALITY NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Net Files",Middle-east,"December 8, 2016"

23116,Fake ‘US embassy’ Bust in Ghana Exposes Danger of EU Schengen Deal with Turkey,"21st Century Wire says Here is a perfect example of a story where the mainstream media will treat the surface narrative   without identifying the real underlying scoop The Reuters report below reveals how a recent police raid of a phony back alley  US Embassy  in the African capital city of Accra, Ghana, netted seizures of a number of illicit travel documents, including authentic European Union Schengen Zone travel visas. It turns out that this organized crime operation was being run by a Turkish crime syndicate This is distrurbing when considered in conjunction with recent demands by Turkey and its President Tayip Erdo an, to be given Schengen Zone free travel throughout the EU for all Turkish citizens  (Image Source: California Courier)Last year, Turkey was effectively using the Syrian refugee crisis to blackmail the EU into paying Ankara 3 Billion Euros in cash as well as Schengen free movement for Turks in and out of the EU. 21WIRE raised the alarm over one year ago   that if Turkey was given a green light by bureaucrats in Brussels for EU travel, then this would potentially enable thousands of ISIS, Al Nusra Front and other salafi terrorists who ve been allowed to roam freely since 2011 into Turkey (with the blessing of the Turkish government) over the Syrian border. Terrorism and organized crime go hand in hand. Can the Turkish government, who is already implicated in aiding and abetting terrorist fighters along its  Jihadi Highway,  really guarantee that there will not be mass document fraud   including Turkish passports for various terrorists moving freely throughout its country?The Ghana syndicate shows just how deeply entrenched Turkish organized crime is in the business of forging visa travel documents. Another reason to be worried about opening up Europe to Turkey . Reuters  Authorities in Ghana have busted a fake US embassy in the capital Accra run by a criminal network that for a decade issued illegally obtained authentic visas, the US State Department has said.Until it was shut down, the sham embassy was housed in a rundown, pink two-storey building with a corrugated iron roof and flew an American flag outside. Inside hung a portrait of the US president, Barack Obama. It was not operated by the United States government, but by figures from both Ghanaian and Turkish organised crime rings and a Ghanaian attorney practising immigration and criminal law,  the State Department said in a statement.Turkish citizens who spoke English and Dutch posed as consular officers and staffed the operation. Investigations also uncovered a fake Dutch embassy, the State Department said.Officials in the Netherlands were not immediately reachable for comment on Sunday.The crime ring issued fraudulently obtained but legitimate US visas and false identification documents, including birth certificates at a cost of $6,000 ( 4,700) each, the statement said.During raids that led to a number of arrests, authorities also seized authentic and counterfeit Indian, South African and Schengen zone visas and 150 passports from 10 different countries along with a laptop and smartphones Continue this article at The GuardianREAD MORE TURKEY NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Turkey Files",Middle-east,"December 6, 2016"

23118,Globalization’s Inside Man: The Problem with David Petraeus in Trump’s Cabinet,"21st Century Wire says If you re going to  drain the swamp  then the last thing you want to do is set a 500 lb crocodile loose into the marshes. Throughout his campaign, President-Elect Donald J. Trump was adamant about getting rid of the redundant North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). So why then is he courting globalist acolyte David Petraeus?Back in 2014, The New American reported: Former general and CIA chief David Petraeus (shown), a key figure in the globalist Council on Foreign Relations and the shadowy Bilderberg network, boasted at a recent conference that the United States of America is set to be merged into the continental regime being erected under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Speaking at the Margaret Thatcher Conference on Liberty last week in London, the ex-commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Iraq essentially celebrated the end of U.S. independence   and by extension, the demise of the Constitution.   After America comes North America,  Petraeus said confidently in answering the question about what comes after the United States, the theme of the panel discussion.  Are we on the threshold of the North American decade, question mark? I threw that away   threw away the question mark   and boldly proclaimed the coming North American decade, says the title now.  He also boasted about how the three economies have been put  together  over the last 20 years as part of the  implementation  of the North American Free Trade Act Undoubtedly, Petraeus is not only a devotee of NAFTA (and the TPP and TTIP), but he is a career committed globalist.What s worse however, is that after his disgraceful exit from Washington, David Petraeus has become a regular attendee at the transatlantic elite globalist confab known as the Bilderberg Meeting   a meeting where North American and European corporate elites, billionaires and corrupted politicians meet in secret behind closed-door to decide the coming year s political and economic  agenda    completely outside of any democratic accountability.So from a globalization perspective, Petraeus has already sold US national sovereignty down the river, and into the swamp. In terms of anything Trump was campaigning on, Petraeus would be globalist embed in his cabinet.From a military perspective, when you throw away the hype, you might find that David Petraeus is one of the most over-rated figures in US military history. After the unmitigated disaster that was Iraq War, Petraeus was awarded the lofty title of ,  The Architect of The Surge,  referring to the 2007 troop surge in Iraq, which itself was a complete media creation after-the-fact, designed to rehabilitate President Bush s abject failure, but also to re-inflate Petraeus s public image in the wake of his own mishandling of classified intelligence into the hands of Deep State operative Paula Broadwell   the woman he was having an extramarital affair with. Petraeus was not only incompetent as a military man (see article below), he had passed state secrets to his mistress while he was head of the CIA before resigning in 2012.Normally, a disastrous record such as this would disqualify any person from ever serving in public office again   but Petraeus is special   he s one of the globalists  most trusted inside men. That s why his path is constantly being paved ahead of him.Many Trump voters rejected Hillary Clinton for her own horrendous private email server debacle   so why would they accept a highly compromised (and convicted) man in Petraeus. If Trump is considering Petraeus for any role in his government   this would be the absolute height of hypocrisy, and should be called out as such.Everyone should read the article below written by veteran CIA Analyst Ray McGovern. Listen to McGovern s recent interview on Patrick Henningsen LIVE last week on Independent Talk 1100 KFNX Consortium News Exclusive: President-elect Trump s promise to  drain the swamp  of Washington seems forgotten   like so many political promises   as he meets with swamp creatures, such as disgraced Gen. David Petraeus, says ex-CIA analyst Ray McGovern .By Ray McGovern  The news that President-elect Donald Trump called in disgraced retired Gen. David Petraeus for a job interview as possible Secretary of State tests whether Trump s experience in hosting  The Celebrity Apprentice  honed his skills for spotting an incompetent phony or not.Does Trump need more data than the continuing bedlam in Iraq and Afghanistan to understand that one can earn a Princeton PhD by writing erudite-sounding drivel about  counterinsurgency  and still flunk war? Granted, the shambles in which Petraeus left Iraq and Afghanistan were probably more a result of his overweening careerism and political ambition than his misapplication of military strategy. But does that make it any more excusable?In 2007, Adm. William Fallon, commander of CENTCOM with four decades of active-duty experience behind him, quickly took the measure of Petraeus, who was one of his subordinates while implementing a  surge  of over 30,000 U.S. troops into Iraq.Several sources reported that Fallon was sickened by Petraeus s unctuous pandering to ingratiate himself. Fallon is said to have been so turned off by all the accolades in the flowery introduction given him by Petraeus that he called him to his face  an ass-kissing little chickenshit,  adding,  I hate people like that. Sadly, Petraeus s sycophancy is not uncommon among general officers. Uncommon was Fallon s outspoken candor.The past decade has shown that obsequiousness to those above him and callousness toward others are two of Petraeus s most notable character traits. They go along with his lack of military acumen and his dishonesty as revealed in his lying to the FBI about handing over top-secret notebooks to his biographer/lover, an  indiscretion  that would have landed a less well-connected person in jail but instead got him only a mild slap on the wrist (via a misdemeanor guilty plea).Indeed, Petraeus, the epitome of a  political general,  represents some of the slimiest depths of the Washington  swamp  that President-elect Trump has vowed to drain. Petraeus cares desperately about the feelings of his fellow elites but shows shocking disdain for the suffering of other human beings who are not so important.In early 2011 in Afghanistan, Petraeus shocked aides to then-President Hamid Karzai after many children were burned to death in a  coalition  attack in northeastern Afghanistan by suggesting that Afghan parents may have burned their own children to exaggerate their claims of civilian casualties and discredit the U.S., reported The Washington Post, citing two participants at the meeting. Killing 60 people, and then blaming the killing on those same people, rather than apologizing for any deaths? This is inhuman,  one Afghan official said.  This is a really terrible situation. Yet, on other occasions, the politically savvy Petraeus can be a paragon of sensitivity   like when he is in danger of getting crosswise with the Israel Lobby.Never did Petraeus s fawning shine through with more brilliance, than when an (unintentionally disclosed) email exchange showed him groveling before arch-neocon Max Boot, beseeching Boot s help in fending off charges that Petraeus was  anti-Israel  because his prepared testimony to a congressional committee included the no-brainer observations that Israeli-Palestinian hostility presents  distinct challenges to our ability to advance our interests  and that  this conflict foments anti-American sentiment, due to a perception of U.S. favoritism for Israel.   Meanwhile, al-Qaeda and other militant groups exploit that anger to mobilize support. So, telling the truth (perhaps accidentally in prepared testimony) made Petraeus squirm with fear about offending the powerful Israel Lobby, but he apparently didn t hesitate to lie to FBI agents when he was caught in a tight spot for sharing highly sensitive intelligence with Paula Broadwell, his mistress/biographer. But, again, Petraeus realized that it helps to have influential friends. A court gave him a slap on the wrist with a sentence of two years probation and a fine of $100,000   which is less than he usually makes for a single speaking engagement Continue this article at Consortium NewsREAD MORE BILDERBERG NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Bilderberg Files",Middle-east,"December 5, 2016"
23119,"WAR ON WORDS: Facebook Censorship Widens, Website to Curate ‘Favored’ News","21st Century Wire says The US media s neoMcCarthy-like witch hunt continues as social media giant Facebook creates a newly designed feature that allows the website to curate  favored news  in its News Feed section.A new feature called  Collections  created by Facebook appears to be yet another exercise in formalizing group think  specifically designed to highlight  approved  mainstream  news , while serving to push down or quell any political piece or issue which falls outside prescribed mainstream Western media talking points. The feature is called Collections and functions similarly to Snapchat s Discover section, which showcases news stories, listicles, videos, and other content submitted by handpicked media partners.  (see report below)It s unclear just how far Facebook is prepared to go in filtering user content, but it appears that the social media platform is introducing a brand new level of algorithmic automated censorship that could potentially create a virtual  blacklist  of online media websites and articles   something which could have a lasting impact on freedom of the press and free speech well into the future.In essence, Facebook s new restrictions smack of Orwellian thought control  Over the past month, The Washington Post published an irresponsible propaganda piece that blamed the 2016 US election results on  fake news  dispensed via sophisticated Russian propaganda. These accusations of course were completely unfounded, deliberately feeding into a paranoid trial by media format that is no doubt echoed by US government sock puppet accounts that act as a digital firing squad by redirecting public perception.SEE ALSO: Washington Post Sloppy  Journalism  Blames Russia for  Fake News  Crisis and Trump s Win, While Pushing Neo-McCarthyismWhile the US mainstream media contends that  fake news  somehow altered the 2016 presidential election cycle, it s important to remember that the US government has some pedigree here, having been behind the creation of bogus social media accounts and personalities for years now.Back in 2011, The UK s Guardian reported that the US government via CENTCOM, was looking to gain a foothold over information shared on the internet through fake online personal accounts: The discovery that the US military is developing false online personalities   known to users of social media as  sock puppets    could also encourage other governments, private companies and non-government organisations to do the same.The Centcom contract stipulates that each fake online persona must have a convincing background, history and supporting details, and that up to 50 US-based controllers should be able to operate false identities from their workstations  without fear of being discovered by sophisticated adversaries . This is just one example. Who really knows how widespread this practice is.You can expect a litany of allegations to continue from the mainstream, along with their faux war on fake news sites which has been used deliberately to discredit and frame genuine investigative analysis in alternative media, its intended target. Western media s anti-Russian hyperbole has morphed and broadened somewhat, thanks to Facebook, Google and Twitter and the alphabet establishment news agencies, Washington has a new go-to scapegoat joining the tired old Russian  hack  meme   independent media.Facebook s new tool to restrict certain posts has already created a backlash as several employees have recently quit the social media site Business Insider reports: Facebook has created a censorship tool to automatically suppress certain posts in specific geographic areas   and several employees who worked on the project quit in dismay, reports the New York Times.This software would give third parties, like internet service providers, the ability to monitor Facebook for popular stories, and suppress them at will. Additional censorship will be administered via a web browser plug-in called the  BS Detector  promoted on the Google Chrome App Store   which labels web articles along political lines.As readers can see, 21st Century Wire is at the top of the list of websites that will be defamed and censored here:https://github.com/selfagency/bs-detector/blob/master/chrome/data/data.json With the blessing of Washington, social engineers in the Silicon Valley will now begin parsing internet content into categories like  Conspiracy Theory  (anything which challenges any official version of events),  Biased  (alternative media opinion critical of the Establishment or government),  Hate  (any article which violates politically correct language), State Run  (targeting Russia s RT and Iran s Press TV, but not the BBC, NPR, Voice of America, or Pentagon & CIA-affiliated CNN), and  Junk Science  (any content which challenges the UN party line on  climate change . This level of social control is almost exactly a depicted in Huxley s dystopian classic, Brave New World.More from Business Insider below .

23121,ON THE INSIDE: Ex-Goldman Sachs Partner Tapped for US Treasury – Joined by Rothschild Linked Commerce Secretary Pick,"Shawn Helton 21st Century WirePresident-elect Donald Trump continues to fill key positions in the White House and in the process, there have already been some controversial cabinet selections. This week the Trump transition team named former Goldman Sachs partner and ex-Soros Fund Management employee (turned Hollywood financier), Steve Mnuchin, as the US Treasury Secretary.The Mnuchin pick, arrives simultaneously as long time billionaire pal of Trump, Wilbur Ross, former head of  Rothschild Inc s bankruptcy advisory business,  becomes Commerce Secretary.While Trump s cabinet nominees for the White House have not yet been set in stone, the two selections mentioned above represent the type of financial syndicate we ve seen in the Washington swamp for many years.  TOO BIG TO FAIL    (Photo Illustration Shawn Helton of 21WIRE)The Financial Crisis & Goldman Sachs In April of 2016, Mnuchin was tasked with being the finance chairman of Trump s 2016 presidential campaign, paving the way for another Wall Street insider to head to the White House.In early November, sources close to CNBC floated the idea that formerly scandal plagued JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, was also up for consideration for US Treasury Secretary before Mnuchin, a long time acquaintance of Trump was officially named.The Mnuchin selection appears at odds with Trump s anti-Wall Street campaign rhetoric, as well as his  drain the swamp  mantra echoed towards the tail end of his presidential run.In fact, the optics of Mnuchin s appointment, seems to strike at the heart of the sub-prime mortgage-backed security lending which led to the 2007-2008 banking crisis.During the economic crash, extremely high risk subprime mortgage-backed securities were crafted from bundled loans. A large amount of these types of mortgages were adjustable rate mortgages, where interests rates would be fixed for a certain number of years, eventually sky rocketing to astronomical increases, subsequently putting the burrower under water as the banks continued to sell these loans to investors. This was a critical aspect that led directly to the foreclosure crisis that swept across the nation in the aftermath of 2008.According to an article featured in the money section of the website of How Stuff Works, we are reminded of the devastating effects of the 2007-2008 crash: In just the month of August 2008, one out of every 416 households in the United States had a new foreclosure filed against it [source: RealtyTrac]. When borrowers stopped making payments on their mortgages, MBSs [mortgage-backed security] began to perform poorly. The average collateralized debt obligation (CDO) lost about half of its value between 2006 and 2008 [source: This American Life]. And since the riskiest (and highest returning) CDOs were comprised of subprime mortgages, they became worthless after the nationwide increase in loan defaults began. Continuing, the article outlines how the hedge-fund Wall Street casino made a fortune by packaging mortgages into bonds to sell to investors: After MBSs hit the financial markets, they were reshaped into a wide variety of financial instruments with different amounts of risk. Interest-only derivatives divided the interest payments made on a mortgage among investors. If interest rates rise, the return is good. If rates fall and homeowners refinance, then the security loses value. In a bold and controversial move, the president-elect s administration by way of Mnuchin, is looking to derail the Dodd-Frank Act, which was put in place in 2010 as a moderate buffer (if at all?) to restrict the type of bank lending that led to the most recent financial crash in 2008. However, naysayers of the  protective act  say it s much to soft on Wall Street, which is in need of tougher restrictions, as any new deregulation could be seen as an attempt to increase the coffers of larger investment banks.In the passage below, The New American expands on this idea through revelations released by the NY Times: According to the text of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the law is supposed  to promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end  too big to fail,  [and] to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts. However, as is usually the case with federal laws, Dodd-Frank does precisely the opposite.  In fact,  reports the New York Times  Gretchen Morgenson:Dodd-Frank actually widened the federal safety net for big institutions. Under that law, eight more giants were granted the right to tap the Federal Reserve for funding when the next crisis hits. At the same time, those eight may avoid Dodd-Frank measures that govern how we re supposed to wind down institutions that get into trouble.   MONEY MAN    Ex-partner of Goldman Sachs Steve Mnuchin nominated to head the US Treasury. (Image Source: mgtvwten.files.wordpress.com)Although Mnuchin has cited that there s a need to restructure the Dodd-Frank Act because it would bring economic growth to regional banks and potentially open lending up to smaller businesses   there is still a fear that this may be a revolving door for the central banks to profit from as well.Zerohedge provides additional background details regarding Munchin s career in banking: Some more on Mnuchin s background: starting his career in the early 1980s as a trainee at Salomon Brothers before moving to Goldman Sachs in 1985, Mnuchin was front and center for the advent of instruments like collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps. He has called securitization  an extremely positive development in terms of being able to finance different parts of the economy and different businesses efficiently.  The pitfalls of the financing method came later, he s said.Mnuchin s father, Robert Mnuchin, was a partner at Goldman Sachs in the 1960s. The second-youngest of five siblings, Steven attended the prestigious Riverdale Country School and then Yale University, where his roommate was Edward Lampert, who would go on to become a hedge-fund manager and owner of Sears. In addition to Goldman, Mnuchin also worked at Soros Fund Management, whose founder, George Soros, has funded many left-leaning causes. Where it gets even more bizarre is that Mnuchin has donated frequently to Democrats, including to Clinton and Barack Obama. As a hedge fund manager, Mnuchin is part of a group of business people Trump has excoriated. In August, Trump said hedge fund managers were  getting away with murder  as he touted his proposal to end the so-called carried interest loophole, which gives private equity and hedge fund managers preferential tax treatment. The hedge fund guys didn t build this country,  Trump said at the time on CBS  Face the Nation.  These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky,  he said.  They are energetic. They are very smart. But a lot of them they are paper-pushers. They make a fortune. They pay no tax. It s ridiculous. Trump s disdain for Wall Street during his campaign run won t soon be forgotten by his supporters as the president-elect s antithetical banking rhetoric will only be magnified by bringing Mnuchin (along with his banking and hedge fund past) into the fold.Mnuchin s confirmation could be a contentious affair (if only for show) due to money made after his purchase of California s IndyMac following the financial crisis. Bloomberg recently stated the following concerning Mnuchin s role in the aftermath of the banking and housing meltdown: In 2009, during the depths of the financial crisis, Mnuchin joined with a group of former Goldman Sachs colleagues and billionaires to buy the remnants of IndyMac, which had collapsed after bingeing on reckless home loans during the frenzy of California s subprime-mortgage boom. They changed the name to OneWest, turned it around and sold the bank for a big gain last year. Continuing, Bloomberg outlines how Mnuchin may have seized on a financial opportunity but stops short of condemning the US Treasury nominee: It s unclear whether OneWest s practices were worse than those of other banks during the financial crisis or how much blame Mnuchin deserves for problems at a financial institution that was troubled before he bought it.Mnuchin declined to comment through a spokesman. But former OneWest Vice Chairman David Fawer said in a statement that the bank inherited loans from IndyMac with  extraordinarily high delinquency rates  and  worked tirelessly to modify thousands of loans to help homeowners through the financial crisis.  The bank has pointed to positive reviews of its foreclosure and loan-modification practices by the Obama Treasury Department, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Interestingly, The Nation reported that Mnuchin purchased the failing IndyMac with an agreement to be  reimbursed  for costs associated to foreclosures that were financed by the company: The Mnuchin group paid FDIC $1.5 billion for the bank, far less than the value of IndyMac s assets. The FDIC was so desperate to unload IndyMac that Mnuchin and his colleagues were able to obtain, as part of the purchase deal, a so-called  shared loss  agreement from the FDIC which reimbursed these billionaires for much of their costs for foreclosing on people unlucky enough to have mortgages from IndyMac.Within a year, the group that the Los Angeles Times called a  billionaires  club of private financiers  had paid themselves dividends of $1.57 billion. In other words, the FDIC took much of the risk by subsidizing the bank s troubled assets, while Mnuchin and his colleagues pocketed the profits. Prior to considering Mnuchin, Trump was said to have considered former CEO of BB&T John Allison, an apparently harsh critic of the Federal Reserve banking system. The following was reported by Business Insider on November 28th: Trump will meet with John Allison, the former CEO of the bank BB&T and of the libertarian think tank the Cato Institute. There have been reports that Allison is being considered for Treasury secretary. Trump s has on the campaign trail questioned the future of the Federal Reserve s political independence, but Allison takes that rhetoric a step further. While running the the Cato Institute, Allison wrote a paper in support of abolishing the Fed.   CABINET PICK    President-elect Donald Trump with fellow billionaire investor Wilbur Ross and vice-president-elect Mike Pence. (Image Source: (mediad.publicbroadcasting) Insiders  & The White HouseJust as Mnuchin s financial behaviour will be under watch, the same will hold true for the newly tapped Commerce Secretary position to be filled by billionaire investor Wilbur Ross.A brief rundown of some of the more controversial aspects of Ross s past were recently published at Forbes: After an getting an MBA from Harvard, he spent two decades heading Rothschild Inc s bankruptcy advisory business, where he represented investors in Trump s failing Taj Mahal casino in the early 1990s. Ross and Carl Icahn convinced bondholders to strike a deal with Trump, who some investors wanted to push out, which allowed Trump to retain control of the property. Continuing, the article described how Ross invested in distressed coal companies in addition to banking opportunities: During the recession Ross targeted another struggling industry: banking. He invested in troubled banks in England, Greece and Cyprus. He was also part of a group of investors that acquired a 35% stake in the Bank of Ireland during the height of Europe s 2011 debt crisis. He sold the last of his stake in 2014, nearly tripling his initial investment. Ross has also reportedly bet hundreds of millions of dollars on downtrodden oil and gas firms since the price of oil began to slide more than two years ago. Incidentally, Ross has maintained a tough public position on so-called free trade deals like NAFTA and the soon-to-be defunct Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) but real questions still remain about his financial acquisitions during distressed times   is he a risk taking business visionary or a financial vulture?Ross has denied being a business liquidator for profit and states that he has worked to rebuild failing businesses.Whatever the case may be, Mnuchin and Ross have touted big corporate tax relief and large tax cuts to the middle class in the US. However, the public should be wary of their dealings with those on Wall Street and any new reform legislation aimed at deregulation.Banking deregulation and reform directed by Wall Street or one of their ilk, should be treated with great suspicion if history is any lesson Below is another look at a passage from a report I complied prior to the election entitled  PARTNERS IN CRIME: Goldman Sachs, The Clintons & Wall Street : In one of the most significant financial rulings in the modern era, the Clinton presidency gave big banks like Goldman Sachs the skeleton key to the kingdom by deregulating the investment banking system almost entirely.The Clinton/Goldman Sachs/Wall Street partnership was fully forged after the removal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which banking luminaries cynically named the  Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999  officially titled the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.  The original Glass-Steagall was a depression-age four-part provision under the Bank Act of 1933 that strictly prohibited securities activities that could be harmful to investors   the same sort of rogue speculating and paper fiat fraud which triggered the Great Depression (1929-1941). In fact, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which repealed Glass-Steagall, opened the door for the  shadow banking  realm outside of regulatory oversight which led to a much higher trading risk, as banks became more interlinked.Simply put: Clinton s repeal of Glass-Steagell removed the firewall between speculative investment banking and regular high street retail and consumer banking   which exposed everyone to toxic, subprime ponzi schemes and fake paper products being pushed around the globe by the banking elite   which ultimately caused the global economy to crash in 2008. All that can be laid at the feet of one William Jefferson Clinton. And Hillary still claims that,  My husband did so well with the economy.  Really?In a cross-posted article featured at Huffington Post, Nomi Prins underscored the complicit nature of Wall Street and Washington after the removal of tighter bank regulations under the Clinton administration during the 1990 s: To grasp the dangers that the Big Six banks (JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley) presently pose to the financial stability of our nation and the world, you need to understand their history in Washington, starting with the Clinton years of the 1990s. Alliances established then (not exclusively with Democrats, since bankers are bipartisan by nature) enabled these firms to become as politically powerful as they are today and to exert that power over an unprecedented amount of capital. Rest assured of one thing: their past and present CEOs will prove as critical in backing a Hillary Clinton presidency as they were in enabling her husband s years in office. Prins herself was a former managing director at Goldman Sachs, senior managing director at Bear Stearns, as well as having worked as a senior strategist at the now defunct investment banking firm Lehman Brothers. Following the financial crash in 2007-2008, Prins blew the whistle on the banking world in a book entitled  It Takes a Pillage: Behind the Bonuses, Bailouts, and Backroom Deals from Washington to Wall Street. Prins has become an advocate for the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall Act since departing from the investment banking world.The media outlet Common Dreams described the merger between Citicorp and Travelers Group (becoming Citigroup), which was dubbed the  Citi-Travelers Act  on Capitol Hill. It was a conglomeration that went hand in hand with the Clinton administration s influence on banking deregulation marked by the repeal of Glass-Steagall: Then, in 1998, in an act of corporate civil disobedience, Citicorp and Travelers Group announced they were merging. Such a combination of banking and insurance companies was illegal under the Bank Holding Company Act, but was excused due to a loophole that provided a two-year review period of proposed mergers. The merger was premised on the expectation that Glass-Steagall would be repealed. Citigroup s co-chairs Sandy Weill and John Reed led a swarm of industry executives and lobbyists who trammeled the halls of Congress to make sure a deal was cut. At the time, it was the largest financial merger even though it was technically illegal, as stated by the former Bankers of America CEO Kenneth Guenther. In 1999, after 12 attempts in 25 years,  Congress passed the Financial Services Modernization Act, which led to the repeal of Glass-Steagall. Both of Trump s finance picks arrive with the all to familiar baggage witnessed within the beltway swamp   and if Mnuchin s and Ross s questionable pasts are to be accepted wholesale, it s difficult to imagine insiders of their pedigree turning over a new leaf for the  everyday man. The following is a screen shot of a statement released by former Goldman CEO and former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson regarding the Mnuchin pick. As a reminder, Paulson presided over the financial crisis and was US Treasury Secretary from 2006-2009. In 2008, amid a flurry of backlash, he authorized a $700 million dollar Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) banking bailout, masking the derivatives scam pulled by Wall Street s top brass:In 2010, CBS News cataloged the long relationship of Goldman Sachs and government,  revealing at least four dozen former employees, lobbyists or advisers at the highest reaches of power both in Washington and around the world. It s also worth noting that White House adviser Steve Bannon and adviser Anthony Scaramucci have also worked for banking behemoth Goldman Sachs.Will Washington see more Wall Street friendly policies under Trump?

23124,"Washington Post attempts to smear Ron Paul Institute and others, as ‘Tools for Russian Propaganda’","21st Century Wire says As 21WIRE reported on Saturday, The Washington Post, once regard s as  America s paper of record,  appears to have gone off the edge of the mainstream media propaganda ridge last week, when it attempt to smear some 200 independent website, labelling these as accomplices in a grand Russian conspiracy to subvert Democracy in the United States. Among the websites placed on the new McCarthyist  Black List  being promoted by The Washington Post, is the Ron Paul Institute of Peace and Prosperity, a libertarian and liberty-based organization. Just as Hillary Clinton is not accepting the result of the Nov 8th election, RPI is not taking The Post s defamation sitting down Timberg s article can be seen as yet another big media attempt to shift the blame for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton s loss of the presidential election away from Clinton, her campaign, and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) that undermined Sen Bernie Sanders  (I-VT) challenge to Clinton in the Democratic primary.  Washington Post billionaire owner and Hillary Clinton supporter Jeff Bezos (above) appears to be waging an anti-Russian crusade, attacking and defaming hundreds independent blogs in the US (Image Source: Now the End Begins)Adam Dick Ron Paul InstituteThe Washington Post has a history of misrepresenting Ron Paul s views. Last year the supposed newspaper of record ran a feature article by David A. Fahrenthold in which Fahrenthold grossly mischaracterized Paul as an advocate for calamity, oppression, and poverty   the opposite of the goals Paul routinely expresses and, indeed, expressed clearly in a speech at the event upon which Fahrenthold s article purported to report. Such fraudulent attacks on the prominent advocate for liberty and a noninterventionist foreign policy fall in line with the newspaper s agenda. As Future of Freedom Foundation President Jacob G. Hornberger put it in a February editorial, the Post s agenda is guided by  the interventionist mindset that undergirds the mainstream media. WaPo publishes article that says @RonPaulInstitut (and others) are ""sophisticated Russian propaganda"" https://t.co/r8QPFEH92X pic.twitter.com/E7wVbKY0vW  Ron Paul (@RonPaul) November 26, 2016On Thursday, the Post published a new article by Craig Timberg complaining of a  flood  of so-called fake news supported by  a sophisticated Russian propaganda campaign that created and spread misleading articles online with the goal of punishing Democrat Hillary Clinton, helping Republican Donald Trump and undermining faith in American democracy,  To advance this conclusion, Timberg points to PropOrNot, an organization of anonymous individuals formed this year, as having identified  more than 200 websites as routine peddlers of Russian propaganda during the election season.  Look on the PropOrNot list. There is the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity s (RPI) website RonPaulInstitute.org listed among websites termed  Russian propaganda outlets. What you will not find on the PropOrNot website is any particularized analysis of why the RPI website, or any website for that matter, is included on the list. Instead, you will see only sweeping generalizations from an anonymous organization. The very popular website drudgereport.com even makes the list. While listed websites span the gamut of political ideas, they tend to share in common an independence from the mainstream media.Ron Paul: Washington Post has a history of misrepresenting the former Congressman s views.. Timberg s article can be seen as yet another big media attempt to shift the blame for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton s loss of the presidential election away from Clinton, her campaign, and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) that undermined Sen Bernie Sanders  (I-VT) challenge to Clinton in the Democratic primary.The article may also be seen as another step in the effort to deter people from looking to alternative sources of information by labeling those information sources as traitorous or near-traitorous.At the same time, the article may be seen as playing a role in the ongoing push to increase tensions between the United States and Russia   a result that benefits people, including those involved in the military-industrial complex, who profit from the growth of US  national security  activity in America and overseas.This is not the first time Ron Paul and his institute has been attacked for sounding pro-Russian or anti-American. Such attacks have been advanced even by self-proclaimed libertarians.Expect that such attacks will continue. They are an effort to tar Paul and his institute so people will close themselves off from information Paul and RPI provide each day in furtherance of the institute s mission to continue and expand Paul s  lifetime of public advocacy for a peaceful foreign policy and the protection of civil liberties at home.  While peace and liberty will benefit most people, powerful interests seek to prevent the realization of these objectives. Indeed, expect attacks against RPI to escalate as the institute continues to reach growing numbers of people with its educational effort.READ MORE MSM LIES AT: 21st Century Wire MSM Files",Middle-east,"November 28, 2016"

23127,REVEALED: How US Government-Media Complex Are The Masters of ‘Fake News’," Washingtons BlogEveryone s talking about  fake news   Google Trends shows that starting in late October   that phrase absolutely exploded in terms of internet searches:In the last month, Obama, Merkel, CNN, the New York Times, Washington Post and many other mainstream media have warned about the dangers of fake news.There certainly is a lot of fake news.  And some of it is by anti-establishment types trying to discredit American institutions with false reports.But as we document below   the government and mainstream media are by far the biggest purveyors of fake news.The Government s Been Deploying Propaganda On U.S. Soil for Many YearsThe United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities found in 1975 that the CIA submitted stories to the American press: After 1953, the network was overseen by Allen W. Dulles, director of the CIA. By this time, Operation Mockingbird had a major influence over 25 newspapers and wire agencies. The usual methodology was placing reports developed from intelligence provided by the CIA to witting or unwitting reporters. Those reports would then be repeated or cited by the preceding reporters which in turn would then be cited throughout the media wire services.The Office of Policy Coordination (OPC) was funded by siphoning off funds intended for the Marshall Plan [i.e. the rebuilding of Europe by the U.S. after WWII]. Some of this money was used to bribe journalists and publishers.In 2008, the New York Times wrote:During the early years of the cold war, [prominent writers and artists, from Arthur Schlesinger Jr. to Jackson Pollock] were supported, sometimes lavishly, always secretly, by the C.I.A. as part of its propaganda war against the Soviet Union. It was perhaps the most successful use of  soft power  in American history.A CIA operative told Washington Post owner Philip Graham  in a conversation about the willingness of journalists to peddle CIA propaganda and cover stories: You could get a journalist cheaper than a good call girl, for a couple hundred dollars a month. Famed Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein wrote in 1977: More than 400 American journalists  in the past twenty five years have secretly carried out assignments for the Central Intelligence Agency, according to documents on file at CIA headquarters. ***In many instances, CIA documents show, journalists were engaged to perform tasks for the CIA with the consent of the managements of America s leading news organizations.***Among the executives who lent their cooperation to the Agency were [the heads of CBS, Time, the New York Times, the Louisville Courier Journal, and Copley News Service. Other organizations which cooperated with the CIA include [ABC, NBC, AP, UPI, Reuters], Hearst Newspapers, Scripps Howard, Newsweek magazine, the Mutual Broadcasting System, the Miami Herald and the old Saturday Evening Post and New York Herald Tribune.***There is ample evidence that America s leading publishers and news executives allowed themselves and their organizations to become handmaidens to the intelligence services.  Let s not pick on some poor reporters, for God s sake,  William Colby exclaimed at one point to the Church committee s investigators.  Let s go to the managements.***The CIA even ran a formal training program in the 1950s to teach its agents to be journalists. Intelligence officers were  taught to make noises like reporters,  explained a high CIA official, and were then placed in major news organizations with help from management.***Once a year during the 1950s and early 1960s, CBS correspondents joined the CIA hierarchy for private dinners and briefings.***Allen Dulles often interceded with his good friend, the late Henry Luce, founder of Timeand Life magazines, who readily allowed certain members of his staff to work for the Agency and agreed to provide jobs and credentials for other CIA operatives who lacked journalistic experience.***In the 1950s and early 1960s, Time magazine s foreign correspondents attended CIA  briefing  dinners similar to those the CIA held for CBS.***When Newsweek was purchased by the Washington Post Company, publisher Philip L. Graham was informed by Agency officials that the CIA occasionally used the magazine for cover purposes, according to CIA sources.  It was widely known that Phil Graham was somebody you could get help from,  said a former deputy director of the Agency.  Frank Wisner dealt with him.  Wisner, deputy director of the CIA from 1950 until shortly before his suicide in 1965, was the Agency s premier orchestrator of  black  operations, including many in which journalists were involved. Wisner liked to boast of his  mighty Wurlitzer,  a wondrous propaganda instrument he built, and played, with help from the press.)***In November 1973, after [the CIA claimed to have ended the program], Colby told reporters and editors from the New York Times and the Washington Star that the Agency had  some three dozen  American newsmen  on the CIA payroll,  including five who worked for  general circulation news organizations.  Yet even while the Senate Intelligence Committee was holding its hearings in 1976, according to high level CIA sources, the CIA continued to maintain ties with seventy five to ninety journalists of every description executives, reporters, stringers, photographers, columnists, bureau clerks and members of broadcast technical crews. More than half of these had been moved off CIA contracts and payrolls but they were still bound by other secret agreements with the Agency. According to an unpublished report by the House Select Committee on Intelligence, chaired by Representative Otis Pike, at least fifteen news organizations were still providing cover for CIA operatives as of 1976.***Those officials most knowledgeable about the subject say that a figure of 400 American journalists is on the low side  . There were a lot of representations that if this stuff got out some of the biggest names in journalism would get smeared   .An expert on propaganda testified under oath during trial that the CIA now employs THOUSANDS of reporters and OWNS its own media organizations. Whether or not his estimate is accurate, it is clear that many prominent reporters still report to the CIA.A 4-part BBC documentary called the  Century of the Self  shows that an American   Freud s nephew, Edward Bernays   created the modern field of manipulation of public perceptions, and the U.S. government has extensively used his techniques.John Pilger is a highly-regarded journalist (the BBC s world affairs editor John Simpson remarked,  A country that does not have a John Pilger in its journalism is a very feeble place indeed ). Pilger said in 2007:We now know that the BBC and other British media were used by the British secret intelligence service MI-6. In what they called Operation Mass Appeal, MI-6 agents planted stories about Saddam s weapons of mass destruction, such as weapons hidden in his palaces and in secret underground bunkers. All of these stories were fake.***One of my favorite stories about the Cold War concerns a group of Russian journalists who were touring the United States. On the final day of their visit, they were asked by the host for their impressions.  I have to tell you,  said the spokesman,  that we were astonished to find after reading all the newspapers and watching TV day after day that all the opinions on all the vital issues are the same. To get that result in our country we send journalists to the gulag. We even tear out their fingernails. Here you don t have to do any of that. What is the secret? Nick Davies wrote in the Independent in 2008: For the first time in human history, there is a concerted strategy to manipulate global perception. And the mass media are operating as its compliant assistants, failing both to resist it and to expose it.The sheer ease with which this machinery has been able to do its work reflects a creeping structural weakness which now afflicts the production of our news. I ve spent the last two years researching a book about falsehood, distortion and propaganda in the global media.The  Zarqawi letter  which made it on to the front page of The New York Times in February 2004 was one of a sequence of highly suspect documents which were said to have been written either by or to Zarqawi and which were fed into news media.This material is being generated, in part, by intelligence agencies who continue to work without effective oversight; and also by a new and essentially benign structure of  strategic communications  which was originally designed by doves in the Pentagon and Nato who wanted to use subtle and non-violent tactics to deal with Islamist terrorism but whose efforts are poorly regulated and badly supervised with the result that some of its practitioners are breaking loose and engaging in the black arts of propaganda. ***The Pentagon has now designated  information operations  as its fifth  core competency  alongside land, sea, air and special forces. Since October 2006, every brigade, division and corps in the US military has had its own  psyop  element producing output for local media. This military activity is linked to the State Department s campaign of  public diplomacy  which includes funding radio stations and news websites. In Britain, the Directorate of Targeting and Information Operations in the Ministry of Defence works with specialists from 15 UK psyops, based at the Defence Intelligence and Security School at Chicksands in Bedfordshire.In the case of British intelligence, you can see this combination of reckless propaganda and failure of oversight at work in the case of Operation Mass Appeal. This was exposed by the former UN arms inspector Scott Ritter, who describes in his book, Iraq Confidential, how, in London in June 1998, he was introduced to two  black propaganda specialists  from MI6 who wanted him to give them material which they could spread through  editors and writers who work with us from time to time .The government is still paying off reporters to spread disinformation. And the corporate media are acting like virtual  escort services for the moneyed elites, selling access   for a price   to powerful government officials, instead of actually investigating and reporting on what those officials are doing.One of the ways that the U.S. government spreads propaganda is by making sure that it gets its version out first. For example, the head of the U.S. Information Agency s television and film division   Alvin A. Snyder  wrote in his book, Warriors of Disinformation: How Lies, Videotape, and the USIA Won the Cold War: All governments, including our own, lie when it suits their purposes. The key is to lie first. ***Another casualty, always war s first, was the truth. The story of [the accidental Russian shoot-down of a Korean airliner] will be remembered pretty much the way we told it in 1983, not the way it really happened.In 2013, the American Congress repealed the formal ban against the deployment of propaganda against U.S. citizens living on American soil. So there s even less to constrain propaganda than before.One of the most common uses of propaganda is to sell unnecessary and counter-productive wars. Given that the American media is always pro-war, mainstream publishers, producers, editors, and reporters are willing participants.It s not just lying about Saddam s non-existent weapons of mass destruction   the corporate media is still selling lies to promote war. While the older generation that pioneered these domestic propaganda techniques has passed from the scene, many of their prot g s are still around along with some of the same organizations. The National Endowment for Democracy, which was formed in 1983 at the urging of CIA Director Casey and under the supervision of Walter Raymond s NSC operation, is still run by the same neocon, Carl Gershman, and has an even bigger budget, now exceeding $100 million a year.Gershman and his NED played important behind-the-scenes roles in instigating the Ukraine crisis by financing activists, journalists and other operatives who supported the coup against elected President Yanukovych. The NED-backed Freedom House also beat the propaganda drums. [See Consortiumnews.com s  A Shadow Foreign Policy. ]Two other Reagan-era veterans, Elliott Abrams and Robert Kagan, have both provided important intellectual support for continuing U.S. interventionism around the world. Earlier this year, Kagan s article for The New Republic, entitled  Superpowers Don t Get to Retire,  touched such a raw nerve with President Obama that he hosted Kagan at a White House lunch and crafted the presidential commencement speech at West Point to deflect some of Kagan s criticism of Obama s hesitancy to use military force.***Rupert Murdoch s media empire is bigger than ever  .Another key to American propaganda is the constant repetition of propaganda. As Business Insider reported in 2013:Lt. Col. Daniel Davis, a highly-respected officer who released a critical report regarding the distortion of truth by senior military officials in Iraq and Afghanistan  .From Lt. Col. Davis:In context, Colonel Leap is implying we ought to change the law to enable Public Affairs officers to influence American public opinion when they deem it necessary to  protect a key friendly center of gravity, to wit US national will. The Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 appears to serve this purpose by allowing for the American public to be a target audience of U.S. government-funded information campaigns.Davis also quotes Brigadier General Ralph O. Baker   the Pentagon officer responsible for the Department of Defense s Joint Force Development   who defines Information Operations (IO) as activities undertaken to  shape the essential narrative of a conflict or situation and thus affect the attitudes and behaviors of the targeted audience. Brig. Gen. Baker goes on to equate descriptions of combat operations with the standard marketing strategy of repeating something until it is accepted:For years, commercial advertisers have based their advertisement strategies on the premise that there is a positive correlation between the number of times a consumer is exposed to product advertisement and that consumer s inclination to sample the new product. The very same principle applies to how we influence our target audiences when we conduct COIN.And those thousands of hours per week of government-funded radio and TV programs  appear to serve Baker s strategy, which states: Repetition is a key tenet of IO execution, and the failure to constantly drive home a consistent message dilutes the impact on the target audiences. Government Massively Manipulates the Web, Social Media and Other Forms of CommunicationOf course, the Web and social media have become a huge media platform, and the Pentagon and other government agencies are massively manipulating both.Documents released by Snowden show that spies manipulate polls, website popularity and pageview counts, censor videos they don t like and amplify messages they do.The CIA and other government agencies also put enormous energy into pushing propaganda throughmovies, television and video games.Cross-Border PropagandaPropaganda isn t limited to our own borders  Sometimes, the government plants disinformation in American media in order to mislead foreigners. For example, an official government summary of America s overthrow of the democratically-elected president of Iran in the 1950 s states,  In cooperation with the Department of State, CIA had several articles planted in major American newspapers and magazines which, when reproduced in Iran, had the desired psychological effect in Iran and contributed to the war of nerves against Mossadeq  (page x).The CIA has also bribed leading foreign journalists.And CNN accepted money from the brutal Bahrani dictatorship to run pro-monarchy propaganda.Everyone Who Challenges the Status Quo Is Labeled As a Purveyor of  Fake News  Or WorseThe First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the freedom of the press from censorship by government.Indeed, the entire reason that it s unlawful for the government to stop stories from being printed is because that would punish those who criticize those in power.Why? Because the Founding Father knew that governments (like the British monarchy) will always crack down on those who point out that the emperor has no clothes.But the freedom of the press is under massive attack in America today  For example, the powers-that-be argue that only highly-paid corporate media shills who will act as stenographers for the fatcats should have the constitutional protections guaranteeing freedom of the press.A Harvard law school professor argues that the First Amendment is outdated and should be abandoned.When financially-savvy bloggers challenged the Federal Reserve s policy, a Fed official called all bloggers stupid and unqualified to comment.And the government is treating the real investigative reporters like criminals   or even terrorists:READ MORE MSM LIES AT: 21st Century Wire MSM Files",Middle-east,"November 27, 2016"
23128,Myriad of ways the CIA tried (and failed) to assassinate Fidel Castro,"RTThe father of the Cuban Revolution remains unbeaten by his foes even in death. We look over the most dramatic assassination plots on El Comandante   from character-assassinations by way of LSD, to Italian mobsters, tuberculosis wetsuit, and exploding cigar. If surviving assassination attempts were an Olympic event, I would win the gold medal,  Castro is famously quoted as saying. Cuba s ex-intelligence chief Fabian Escalante   the person tasked with guarding Fidel s life   puts the number of attempts at 638. The man also claimed to Reuters in a 2010 interview that the John F. Kennedy assassination could well have been an attempt to expedite the process of removing Castro from power: the American president, some said, was not doing enough. Of course, by the time of Kennedy s 1963 shooting death in Dallas, Texas, there had already been numerous attempts on Castro s life   intended to bolster Kennedy s own reputation back home as a strong president, with his administration exerting great pressure on the CIA to take care of it. It is fitting then to start at the beginning.When a sizable cache of classified CIA documents, amicably called  Family Jewels,  was finally released in 2007, Cuban communists felt a sense of vindication, finally gaining the ability to publicly accuse the United States government of what they claimed was already common knowledge.In the summer of 1960, the CIA recruited former FBI agent Robert Maheu. He became the go-between from the agency to two prominent Italian gangsters on the FBI s Ten Most Wanted List   Santo Trafficante of the Miami Syndicate, and Salvatore Giancana   Al Capone s successor in Chicago. They were gotten hold of by way of Las Vegas mobster Johnny Roselli. A payment of $150,000 was on the table. According to the declassified documents, Giancana suggested using poisoned pills   six of them. But despite gaining access to officials inside the Cuban government, the plan had been unsuccessful, and was later scrapped in the run-up to the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. It is said the agency was able to retrieve all the poison pills.The closest the Americans got to killing Castro was with a poisoned chocolate milkshake, Escalante claimed to Reuters. According to the 2007 documents, another batch of poison was delivered through the Mafia in 1963 in a bottle of Bayer aspirin pills. An opposition group, it was believed, had a good chance. But the plot failed when a disguised waiter did not manage to lace Castro s milkshake in the cafeteria of the then-Hilton Hotel (now Havana Libre), as the pill got stuck in the freezer   where it was hidden   and broke apart when the assassin attempted to dislodge it from the wall.This was not just about spiking drinks or cigars. The CIA went all-out. After a failed attempt to embarrass El Comandante by having his beard fall out due to boots spiked with chemicals, the agency had opted for a box of cigars spiked with LSD. The plan was to have Castro burst into laughter during a televised interview, thus subjecting him to ridicule in the public eye. But it was not just cigars. The CIA planned to lace the entire studio. This plot was not implemented, but was high in the running for ways to spark a national uprising against Castro.The CIA had back-paddled on another of its ingenious plans to kill Castro, leading to the poisoned scuba gear idea. The agency knew the revolutionary was an avid diver. The plan had been to attract El Comandante with a sea shell practically impossible to miss, having been painted in colors bright enough to attract him. Castro would swim closer to inspect it, whereupon a lethal amount of explosives would detonate. But the idea was aborted due to impracticality, the declassified documents claimed. So the spies went the more practical way: lacing Castro s scuba gear with tuberculosis to trigger a deadly skin disease. The man who was supposed to give Castro the suit had opted to give him an ordinary one, it turned out.According to a Saturday Evening Post report on November 4, 1967, a CIA agent had approached a New York cop with the idea of handing Castro an exploding cigar during a UN meeting. That was reportedly after the plan to poison the cigar had been abandoned. This was despite the poison having already been injected into the cigar, with the CIA dismissing the person tasked with carrying the plan out in the final stages.However, the exploding-cigar plan also failed due to the double agent changing his mind at the last instant.ne of Castro s many lovers   CIA informant Marita Lorenz, was also tasked with poisoning Castro in a daring operation involving a secret unit tasked with the assassination   Operation 40. According to the FBI, Lorenz had become a  contract agent  for the CIA, and willingly accepted the task of assassinating him following a miscarriage or an abortion   a story she told in 1959. Castro s reaction to her not having the child had reportedly enraged her so much, she had eagerly taken up the task. And so she met with CIA double agent Frank Sturgis in 1960, who had handed her a bottle of poison pills.Lorenz was to drop one into her lover s drink, containing enough poison to kill him within 30 seconds. But as with the countless other attempts, it did not succeed because Lorenz herself could not go through with it. The mission was wrought with pitfalls. According to Ann Louise Bardoch s  Cuba Confidential: Love and Vengeance in Miami and Havana,  Lorenz recalled that  They said,  we want you to take him out.  But,  I knew the minute I saw the outline of Havana I couldn t do it. Even then, she had made the mistake of stashing the pills in her pot of cold cream, in fear of being discovered by customs. The substance had stuck to the pills, and Lorenz couldn t unmix the two. As she attempted to flush the pills down the toilet, Castro  who had got wind of the plot   walked in with a cigar. He removed his handgun from the holster, and handed it to Lorenz with the words:  Did you come to kill me?  According to Lorenz, he handed her the gun and puffed on his cigar with his eyes closed. He made himself vulnerable because he knew I couldn t do it. He still loved me and I still loved him. She feared the CIA would kill her for being with Castro after the foiled assassination attempt. Upon her return to Miami, Lorenz never again met with Castro. Later, however, she had a daughter with another Latin American military leader, Venezuela s Marcos Perez Jimenez.According to Escalante, it was the Cuban revolutionary s vigilance and the efforts of his security apparatus that kept him alive all those years. Numerous books have been written on the matter.READ MORE CUBA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Cuba Files",Middle-east,"November 27, 2016"

23130,"Washington Post Sloppy ‘Journalism’ Blames Russia for “Fake News” Crisis and Trump’s Win, While Pushing Neo-McCarthyism","Patrick Henningsen 21st Century Wire The mainstream media s post-election hysteria has taken on new level of crazy. It seems that The Washington Post has gone off the deep end this week, claiming that Russia is behind the  fake news  crisis which they claim helped propel an insurgent Donald Trump to victory on Nov 8th, and they are still standing by the official conspiracy theory that Russia has somehow hacked into the US elections. Everything that s wrong with the establishment media is contained within this incredible story The hacking claim is nothing new  backed by the White House and trumpeted by Hillary Clinton, the US mainstream media has claimed that Russia has been hacking and manipulating our US elections. The only problem is it never happened. What s more disturbing though, is the complete collapse in journalistic standards at what used to be considered  America s paper of record. It seems the The Post is playing a key role in waging a new McCarthy-style witch hunt targeting any independent websites which dare to challenge the prevailing anti-Russian party line currently dominating the mainstream political and media establishment   evident beyond any doubt after reading this latest feature in The Washington Post written by Craig Timberg entitled,  Russian propaganda effort helped spread  fake news  during election, Experts say. Experts say ? Make no mistake, this was a true-to-form propaganda piece by the Washington Post, and in itself could be classed as actual  fake news. Not surprisingly, it wasn t difficult to debunk this article. I take no pleasure in saying this, as The Post was once a newspaper I admired growing up, however, what s going on right now with America s mainstream media is nothing short of tragic. More than anything, the 2016 Election showed the world how biased, corrupt and broken America s papers of record have become. Instead of emulating Woodward and Bernstein, it seems most of  the  journalists  are channeling Stephen Glass instead. For those who don t know already, Glass was one of Washington s fake news pioneers of note, writing for the leftwing magazine, New Republic. Glass routinely madeup news stories which his journalism school-trained editors weren t smart enough to pick up on.It s clear that the same partisan Clinton and Democratic Party supporters embedded in the media who were pushing anti-Russian talking points throughout the election cycle   are not giving up. As I pointed out in my pre-election piece entitled,  Hillary s  Russian Hack  Hoax: The Biggest Lie of this Election Season,  what was previously a stance reserved for right-wing neoconservative hawks and Cold War hold-outs has become the new standard for the establishment wing of the Democratic Party   which is the universal demonization of Russia, and the hitlerization of its current president, Vladimir Putin.The mainstream media continues to lower the bar on what it claims is  journalism .  Just when you thought you ve seen the worst, unsourced, completely contrived  investigation,  the Washington Post, which used to be regarded as the paragon of American journalism, has produced a rant of an article that is written as if it were a student submission: The flood of  fake news  this election season got support from a sophisticated Russian propaganda campaign that created and spread misleading articles online with the goal of punishing Democrat Hillary Clinton, helping Republican Donald Trump and undermining faith in American democracy, say independent researchers who tracked the operation. You have to feel bad for The Post s Craig Timberg (photo, left) who seems to have drawn the short straw this week in the anti-Russia propaganda pool at the Post.  According to his biography at the John S. Knight Journalism Fellowship at Stanford, Timberg s primary mission is,  studying potential revenue sources and business opportunities related to foreign news coverage, which he fears is under particular threat from digital disruption of the news industry.  The perfect man for the job.His Thanksgiving Day expos  posits a unified theory of a Trump-Putin axis of evil   an all of the above, buckshot blog post pushed out by the Washington Post (amazing) where Timberg claims The Russians are not only behind the US establishment s latest  fake news  hysteria, but also hacking  both DNC and the US elections, and carrying Donald Trump into the White House.To support his case, Timberg claims that: Two teams of independent researchers found that the Russians exploited American-made technology platforms to attack U.S. democracy at a particularly vulnerable moment, as an insurgent candidate harnessed a wide range of grievances to claim the White House. So The Post claims that the Russians hacked the DNC and US elections systems, engineered Facebook s  fake news  crisis,  which helped get Trump elected. In order to weave all three of these things together, Timberg had to rely on the mainstream media s propaganda weapon of choice: anonymous sources. After that, it was just a case of plugging-in and hyperlinking to previous Washington Post headlines made to look as if these events actually happened, when no evidence exists to date that they ever did:This story was used to great effect by Hillary Clinton herself on national TV during the Presidential debates. The headline is written to give the false impression there was actual proof to back up such profound accusations, but when you actually read the article, there is nothing. It seems that in today s Washington Post, what passes for evidence can be as little as the President accusing Russia of being involved. The statement from the vaunted  intelligence community  is about as vague as it gets, stating, The U.S. Intelligence Community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations,  said a joint statement from the two agencies.  . . . These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.  No proof, no evidence, but  they are  confident .  This must be the same sort of confidence these same intelligence agencies had when they briefed Colin Powell about Saddam Hussein s mobile anthrax labs, aka The Winnebagos of Death. Sounds crazy, I know, but it was good enough for the mainstream media in 2002-2003, just like  we are confident  is good enough for the Washington Post today.2.  Russian hackers targeted Arizona election system  (By Ellen Nakashima, Washington Post Aug 29, 2016)Despite the misleading headline, the article does not contain any evidence or anything remotely near  proof  by any normal journalistic standards. But this is not normal journalism. After reading past the colorful headline in the Arizona Russian Hack story, it gets really vague, claiming the FBI s theory that  Russia did it  was,  credible  and significant,  an eight on a scale of one to 10.  It s hard not to laugh when reading some of these mainstream stories. It gets better, saying that,  FBI investigators did not specify whether the hackers were criminals or employed by the Russian government. Bureau officials on Monday declined to comment   What else is this but Washington-based, politically motivated propaganda, designed to scapegoat Russia?By definition, Timberg is using actual fake and misleading news articles (produced by his employer the Washington Post) in order to validate his own unified conspiracy theory. It s hard to tell if Timberg himself is even aware of what he s doing. If not, certainly an argument can be made for mainstream  journalists  who are so ensconced in their own corporate bubble that they actually believe their own organization s propaganda.RELATED: Hillary s  Russian Hack  Hoax: The Biggest Lie of This Election SeasonDespite the best efforts of Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party, the White House and mainstream media outlets like CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, the New York Times, The Washington Post, Politico.com and countless other outlets   all of whom either endorsed Hillary Clinton or tailored their news coverage to favor her campaign   with many even colluding directly with the Democratic National Committee (DNC)  to date there is still zero evidence to validate the establishment s official conspiracy theory that Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin master-minded the greatest election heist in modern history. VIRTUAL WITCH HUNT:  PropOrNot.com Deep Throat: The Washington Post s Secret  Source Timberg claims to have a mysterious deep throat  source    apparently these are  researchers  from a group called PropOrNot, a website which just sprung up on October 30, 2016, and who claims to have  proof  that ties together  Fake News /  Pro-Trump  articles online  back to Russia. The only problem is, he can t show us any of their research, nor can he tell us the name of the principal, allegedly because this person fears threats of retribution.  Timberg states,  The way that this propaganda apparatus supported Trump was equivalent to some massive amount of a media buy,  said the executive director of PropOrNot, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being targeted by Russia s legions of skilled hackers. When you hear things like this in the mainstream media, there is a high probability you are reading an actual government-sponsored propaganda piece.More likely, the only fear ProOrNot s authors have is of being held accountable for their own online smear and propaganda campaign.PropOrNot s web domain registration is also hidden behind  Domains By Proxy,  a company in Scottsdale Arizona.Timberg s  source  is a nameless website, with no author names given, with links to Boycott Russia Today,  and yet, PropOrNot claims to be  a nonpartisan collection of researchers with foreign policy, military and technology backgrounds,  and Timberg says they plan to release their findings on Friday showing the startling reach and effectiveness of Russian propaganda campaigns.  (PropOrNot) planned to release its own findings Friday showing the startling reach and effectiveness of Russian propaganda campaigns,  stated Timberg.Timberg s highly anticipated  release  scheduled for today from the anonymous source doesn t seem to have happened though. A visit to PropOrNot s website Friday shows no such report released. When, or if such a report is actually released by the website, it will certainly be interesting to analyze its findings.UPDATE 11/27/16: The much anticipated groundbreaking report finally arrived and can be found online here and in PDF here. On first glance, it s much worse than we thought, but our analysis is still forthcoming.Thus far the only  investigation  PropOrNot has done was an article implicating the financial news site Zero Hedge posted on Oct 31st and can be found here   a unintelligible mix of websites, speculating that they are somehow linked and in league with the Kremlin. It claims its thesis in corroborated by other sites PropOrNot says are  our allies    similar anti-Russia web sources including the EU Disinformation Review (a  campaign  run by the EU s East StratCom Task force), Polygraph Info (run by US gov t-backed Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Voice of America), Fake News Watch (home of an extensive virtual book burning list), Stop Fake (Ukraine based, Pro-Maidan), Russia Lies (run by Julia Davis, a  national security expert  behind the tabloid reports alleging foul play in celebrity Britney Murphy s death), and of course no anti-Russian allied list would be complete without Bellingcat (by now a widely discredited, Atlantic Council/NATO-linked, anti-Russian, anti-Syrian,  open source investigation  website, run by Elliot Higgins).The timing of this anti-Russian campaign is no coincidence either. This week the EU passed a new anti-Russian resolution to  counter act  supposed Russian propaganda:  EU strategic communication to counteract propaganda against it by third parties , with 179 voting against it and 208 abstaining. BEWARE: McCarthyism is still in style in 2016 (Image: @21WIRE)PropOrNot s  Executive Summary  (yes, we re trying not to laugh, too) states: Thus far we at PropOrNot have identified over 200 distinct websites which qualify as Russian propaganda outlets according to our criteria, and target audiences in the United States. We estimate the regular US audiences of these sites to number in the tens of millions. We are gathering data to measure that more precisely, but we are confidant that it includes at least 15 million Americans. The McCarthyite tone of their defamation is breathtaking, as the site claims they can spot Russian agents of influence online and collaborator websites through an endless list of  things to look out for :( ) 9. Refer their audiences to each other, via hyperlinks and other means, at disproportionately high rates;10. Are consistently visited by the same audiences, both directly and via search, demonstrating that those intra-network referrals build  brand loyalty  in their audiences over time;11. Are consistently visited by their audiences after searches for terms which congrue with the Russian propaganda  line , and are unrelated to the purported focus of their branding; ( ) I guess it never occurred to these geniuses that people might be loyal followers of well-established alternative websites like AntiWar.com, Counterpunch, Information Clearing House, OpEd News, Activist Post, Global Research.ca, Oriental Review, Truth-Out, Truth Dig, Zero Hedge, Consortium News (run by award-winning US journalist Robert Parry), Ron Paul Institute (former US Congressman) and Paul Craig Roberts (former Cabinet member under President Reagan), to name only a few off of PropOrNot s massive list of alleged  Russian propaganda collaborators. This is basically an amateur attempt to reverse engineer a virtual conspiracy   spuriously connecting 200 popular alternative websites   with a theoretical Russian plot. It should be a cause for concern that The Washington Post is now promoting a  Blacklist  in the spirit of Joe McCarthy s Red Scare.Michael Krieger, editor of Liberty BlitzKrieg, one the sites on PropOrNot s  List  sums up the fundamental flaw in both Timberg and ProOrNot s insular Washington DC-centric mainstream bubble thinking: What s particularly interesting about this list, isn t the fact that a bunch of anonymous whiners decided to demonize successful critics of insane, inhumane and ethically indefensible U.S. government policy, but rather the fact that the Washington Post decided to craft an entire article around such a laughably ridiculous list. This just further proves a point that is rapidly becoming common knowledge amongst U.S. citizens with more than a couple of brain cells to rub together. The mainstream media is the real fake news. Krieger adds:  Unfortunately, this is apparently all we know so far about this shadowy organization, which is simply hilarious considering the group deems any alternative news source that does not agree with the U.S. government narrative to be either outright Russian propaganda, or  useful idiots. Krieger makes an indisputable point though, and one that s also been made by numerous qualified pundits: by far the most prolific purveyor of real fake news and propaganda, especially over the last 30 years   is undoubtedly the US and UK media, and as we can all see   they haven t slowed down.The issue of confirmation bias in western media is chronic, but it s also institutional problem when you consider that many of these mainstream writers are submerged under their own layer of Western-generated American or British propaganda. As a result, they might be completely oblivious of the fact that John Kerry has been caught lying to the world at the UN about what Russia supposedly did in the Ukraine, Crimea, and Syria, or they might have missed UN Ambassador Samantha Power s shrill antics at the UN   an embarrassment to the US in front of a world audience, or Admiral John Kirby s epic meltdown last week after he couldn t defend his own lies to an RT reporter at the US State Department press briefing. On Syria in particular, US politicians have lied so much and so often, that most serious people around the world do not believe a word that comes out of this Administration s mouth   and American and European bloggers most certainly have a right to point this out   not because it pleases Putin  but because they are disgusted with their own government s poor (and highly illegal) conduct on the world stage, especially at this moment in Syria and Yemen. Evidently, none this factors into the reports by Timberg and PropOrNot. Maybe they didn t get the memo either, about the fact that Assad did not  gas his own people  in East Ghouta in August 2013, or any other time that can be proven by his accusers.Many in the US media are simply living inside of their own self-generated, self-reverential propaganda bubble.SEE ALSO: Mainstream Liars Now Want to be Self-Appointed Monarchs of  Truth Even more incredibly, PropOrNot then implores its visitors to only visit get information from US-gov funded news sources like NPR, state-owned media like the BBC, Murdoch-owned and financed outlets like the Wall Street Journal and VICE News, and corporate establishment media sources: We call on the American public to: Obtain news from actual reporters, who report to an editor and are professionally accountable for mistakes. We suggest NPR, the BBC, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, Buzzfeed, VICE, etc, and especially your local papers and local TV news channels. Support them by subscribing, if you can! It s pretty incredible to see The Washington Post basing a case on an anonymous website   one which is conducting a virtual witch hunt, clearly with malicious intent (to smear some 200 websites), as a primary journalistic source? Incredible.At this point, everyone should question the political motives of Washington Post staff writer Craig Timberg. It s beyond outrageous even by today s decrepid standards.Judging by the looks of it, PropOrNot itself is a pretty good example of pure black propaganda.Who is behind Timberg s  source  PropOrNot? Is it Timberg himself? Is it run by staff at The Washington Post? As it s so secretive, then you can t rule that possibility out.In true NeoMcCarthyite form, PropOrNot has also issued  The List    a guide to alternative media websites which it accuses of  echo Russian propaganda.  As of today, amazingly, 21st Century Wire.com is not included on their virtual book burning list (but its likely to be after they read this article).Strangely, there is no mention at all by Timberg about a report by BuzzFeed News which identified the primary source of the actual  fake news  flooding Facebook   more than 150 pro-Trump websites being run from a single town, by a cohort of savvy teenagers in Veles, Macedonia   which is not Russia. Granted, Buzzfeed and The Guardian are both establishment media that sometimes produce their own propaganda. However, unless Timberg can refute either the Buzzfeed or The Guardian reports on this subject, or somehow tie his suspected battery of  Kremlin controlled hackers to Veles, then this entire unified conspiracy theory in D.O.A.According to these investigations, the Veles crew are not ideologically motivated, but rather, driven by that old classic   money. They are raking it in with standard Google Ad Sense and other online traffic CPM advertising unit revenue, with incomes ranging from $5,000 to as high as $30,000 per month.  They re not doing it for Mother Russia, but rather for Benjamin Franklin.No CredibilityJust when you thought it couldn t get any worse for PropOrNot, on their front page they posted this: UPDATE: We are publishing our Black Friday Report, adding FAQ entries, updating The List, and more! Please see our latest post for more information. Also, for a sense of what certain kinds of Russian trolls look and sound like in real life, check out this Samantha Bee segment, which cleverly interviews Russian social-media and comment-section propagandists: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OauLuWXD_RI  [PropOrNot links to the Samantha Bee Show]Aside from the fact that this secret Washington Post source would rely on the Samantha Bee Show for anything, the geniuses at PropOrNot seem to have missed the fact that the alleged Russian Trolls were acting for money   they convinced Bee they were a  the real deal  when she approached them via Twitter, where the hoaxer and his female associate were paid $10,000 for appearing on Bee s Full Frontal  show.Bee may have just fell short of a Pulitzer for that one. Example of an actual fake news post on a Facebook news group from the website USINFONEWS.com (Nov. 2016)It s certainly possible that the Macedonia s fake news bedroom empire is being managed by someone higher up the food chain than a cadre of eastern European gamers, but based on their ubiquitous references to breaking FOX News events and nuanced political and emotive button pushing from these faux news sites   it s on the whole much more likely that any alleged  Pro-Trump  hidden hand would be more likely directing their talking points from inside of the United States.Timberg s fake story in The Post was then echoed by Daniel Politi at the popular liberal website The Slate, under the heading,  How Russian Propaganda Used Facebook to Spread Fake News During the Election,  in an attempt to give more credence to Timberg s contrived thesis:Politi says,  .. at least some of the false news that spread in the last few months of the campaign appears to have had much more serious geopolitical implications and was spread thanks to  a sophisticated Russian propaganda campaign,  reports the Washington Post, which cites two recent expert reports on the issue. Again,  expert  claims. Just to remind readers, the first expert is an anonymous Russiaphobic website PropOrNot, while the other  expert  writes for an anti-Russian blog and works for a neoconservative think tank (see Neocon below).Less we forget, The Slate invented a fake story that went viral in October, one which was retweeted by Hillary Clinton herself. Apparently, Clinton s campaign staff fed her planted online news story created by another on The Slate s  journalists  named Franklin Foer, complete with the comical clickbait headline,  Was a Trump Server Communicating With Russia?  Here s Hillary Clinton s tweet of The Slate s own  fake news  story:It's time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia. https://t.co/D8oSmyVAR4 pic.twitter.com/07dRyEmPjX  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 31, 2016John Roberts at Forbes explains how The Slate got caught passing off actual  fake news at the height of the election,  The bottom line is that Slate screwed up by publishing this in the first place, and by adding more kooky misinformation to an already addled election season. As for Foer, he says on Twitter a  follow up  piece is in the works. What the difference between The Slate s fake news story and the Macedonian fake Trump stories on Facebook? There is no difference, other than the fact that Hillary Clinton ended up making a fool out of herself by tweeting out  and validating to her millions of followers   a completely make-up, fake news story by The Slate. So Craig Timberg and The Slate are guilty of doing exactly what Timberg and his deep throat  source  PropOrNot are accusing Russia s alleged clandestine Facebook and blogger network of doing   passing around and  echoing fake news. How these  journalists  at The Washington Post and The Slate expect to be taken seriously after this is just beyond the pale.Neocon Think Tanks and other  Experts Craig Timberg s other supporting  evidence  or opinion (it s hard to tell the difference in the Washington Post these days) is being supplied by Clint Watts from the ubiquitously titled, Foreign Policy Research Institute (FPRI), a Cold War era  think tank  (not surprisingly, still stuck in the Cold War), no doubt with links to Washington s intelligence establishment. If that think tank sounds familiar to any neocon fossil hunters, you d know that FPRI is run by none other than John Lehman, one of the original signatories to the neoconservative doctrine of continuous war, Project for a New American Century (PNAC), and a foreign policy advisor to both John McCain and Mitt Romney   two virulent anti-Russian hawks. So it s no surprise then that Timberg is referencing his  expert  Watts, along with co-authors Andrew Weisburd and JM Berger, in an article from the website War On the Rocks, entitled: Trolling For Trump: How Russia is Trying to Destroy Our Democracy.   This is coupled with a related story by Watts and Andrew Weisburd published at the very anti-Russian publication, the Daily Beast, entitled:How Russia Dominates Your Twitter Feed to Promote Lies (And, Trump, Too) Fake news stories from Kremlin propagandists regularly become social media trends. Here s how Moscow does it  and what it means for America s election 2016. Impressive headline, if not a touch Click Bait-y. Once again, the familiar mainstream media pattern of misleading headlines inferring that the article contains actual evidence, and again, the evidence supplied by Watts is that  a lot of people think Russia did it,  claiming that: And the evidence is compelling. A range of activities speaks to a Russian connection: the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign officials, hacks surrounding voter rolls and possibly election machines, Putin s overt praise for Trump, and the curious Kremlin connections of Trump campaign operatives Paul Manafort and Carter Page. Very  compelling ? Essentially, the above are a series of familiar, albeit recycled, talking points that may as well have beamed-in via John Podesta s personal Blackberry. To Clinton supporters, those talking points sounded plausible a month ago, but even staunch Clintonites are fast abandoning the Russian conspiracy theories. For establishment supporters of Hillary Clinton, that translates as case closed. This is a perfect example of a propaganda bubble, or a self-feeding propaganda loop. Many have argued that it was this sort of delusional incestuous closed loop that inadvertently helped to get Donald Trump elected on Nov 8th.Timberg s source at War On the Rocks also claims that Putin has rebooted the old Soviet  Active Measures  information warfare program designed to  Undermine citizen confidence in democratic governance.  Their evidence: a 1992 document from the US Information Agency, of course, not anything from Russia itself. Again, we ll have to accept the word of the  intelligence community,  because they talked about it back in 1992. The rest of the theory is comprised of a fill-in-the-blanks exercise plugging-in a little Alex Jones for good measure, and various other websites   into a highly creative infographic  proving  the Russians are waging an  Active Measures on Steroid  information warfare against the United States.Here s creative infographic from their website designed to stitch together Watts s elaborate conspiracy theory: Watts also claims that anyone in the West who supports Bashar al Assad in Syria is doing so at the behest of this  Russian Active Measures  operation: When experts published content criticizing the Russian-supported Bashar al Assad regime, organized hordes of trolls would appear to attack the authors on Twitter and Facebook. Examining the troll social networks revealed dozens of accounts presenting themselves as attractive young women eager to talk politics with Americans, including some working in the national security sector. These  honeypot  social media accounts were linked to other accounts used by the Syrian Electronic Army hacker operation. All three elements were working together: the trolls to sow doubt, the honeypots to win trust, and the hackers (we believe) to exploit clicks on dubious links sent out by the first two. This is derivative theorizing that would make even Bellingcat wince. The use of the word  troll  as a generalized pejorative label is buttressed by an even more bias notion that no one in the west would ever be against regime change in Syria, unless they were convinced otherwise by attractive Russian online honeypots. This level of  research  is beyond ridiculous, and yet, this is what passes for a  trusted source  at the Washington Post today.Political Bias: An Occupational Hazzard at The Washington PostIn a previous article, it s just a little too obvious that Timberg can t hold back his disappointment in Hillary Clinton s defeat when you read his headline: Could better Internet security have prevented Trump s shocking win? The election of Republican Donald Trump has stunned Silicon Valley, sparking renewed fears about how the federal government s powerful surveillance machinery could undermine personal privacy   especially in the hands of a man with a history of threatening retaliation against those who challenge him,  claims Timberg.The hysterical lamenting quickly turns to fear mongering: In Silicon Valley, many were dazed after Tuesday s election. Some companies let their employees take the day off or wrote all-staff letters reminding their colleagues of their commitment to inclusive workplaces that protect women, immigrants and minorities. Techies, meanwhile, warned one another on Twitter to begin using privacy and encrypted tools. What is the difference between this politicized diatribe and the fake Macedonia posts on Facebook? There is no difference, they are doing the same thing. What is going on at The Washington Post? It looks like the organization abandoned any pretence of objective journalism.Here you have a writer who is on staff at The Washington Post and a fellow at Stanford University s John S. Knight School of Journalism   trying to posit a unified conspiracy theory that Russia steered the outcome of a US Presidential Election.Timberg is just one of many examples of overtly politically bias writers in mainstream publications, specifically employed by The Washington Post, New York Times, ABC, CBS, CNN and others.  Many were caught working in collusion with the Hillary Clinton campaign, like The Post s  star reporter  Juliet Eilperin who was revealed in an email to have offered John Podesta a  heads up  about a story she was about to publish, even going so far as to provide the Clinton campaign CEO with a brief pre-publication synopsis. Here are a few more famous  journalists  and their corrupted publications guilty of colluding with the Clinton Campaign: Not surprisingly, Timberg then goes on to call the news output of RT (Russia Today)  propaganda,  and goes on to base his value judgment on a Rand Corporation report that describes Russian media as a  propaganda efforts a  firehose of falsehood  because of their speed, power and relentlessness    a report which also claims that Russia attacked neighboring Georgia in 2008, a common western meme, when in reality it was US-backed Georgian military forces that attacked South Ossetia   an obvious point which Timberg seems to have overlooked due to his own confirmation bias. Sadly, this is par for the course with most US media pundits, most of whom do not really care what actually happened, only what Washington s party line is on events.His source, War on the Rocks, continues pushing their conspiracy theory, stating,  But most observers are missing the point. Russia is helping Trump s campaign, yes, but it is not doing so solely or even necessarily with the goal of placing him in the oval office. Rather, these efforts seek to produce a divided electorate and a president with no clear mandate to govern. The ultimate objective is to diminish and tarnish American democracy. I think America has managed to do a pretty good job of that by itself.Decline of the US Mainstream MediaThe loss of credibility is the least of The Post s worries though.The reality is that in an effort to recoup dwindling revenues needed to pay for its inflated salaries and non-investigative  investigations, The Washington Post themselves have had to resort to pushing daily some of the most gratuitous  click bait  stories on the web. Here s one of many daily low-brow items, this  Polar Bear Eats Dog  story is from Tuesday Nov 22nd:If you follow the Post s newsfeed, you will see endless articles like the polar bear story, most of which carry a deceptive headline that does not reflect the story in the article. That s real Click Bait, and it s now their bread and butter.In an age of universal corruption in Washington and rampant collusion between political elites and the US corporate media, it s much easier to scapegoat an existential enemy for every systemic and institutional crisis affecting America. Whole industries have been spun out of this old habit: the intelligence industry, the defense industry, and the new  security  industry   collectively well over a trillion-dollar per year financial concern requires a boogyman in order to justify not only its existence, but also its corporate share prices, and financial growth projections. Now there s a real unified conspiracy theory for you! Maybe Craig Timberg should consider looking into that conspiracy, in the tradition of the former versions of Woodward and Bernstein.Author Jay Dyer explained the current corporate media structure in America today in his article entitled,  The Entire Mainstream Warmongering Media is Fake,  explaining,  Given the mainstream media is almost wholly owned by 6 conglomerates, we can begin to see how the coordination and control once considered a  conspiracy theory  is now made evident. 2012 Ownership Chart (Image Source: Jays Analysis)In 1983, there were 50 and now it is roughly six, with NewsCorp owning the largest papers on three continents. That these facts sound like a  conspiracy theory  can only be presumed from a position of ignorance, especially given the full coordination and deception regarding the Trump   Clinton election of 2016, from rigged polls to Wikileaks revelations of 6o plus top media operatives directly promoting Hillary. Dyer adds,  If the Trump phenomena showed anything, it showed the consensus reality the mainstream media attempted to create concerning Hillary s certain victory, as well as the consensus reality erected for decades, is not omnipotent. In short, the entire US corporate media seems to function with a singular hive mind, aggressively promoting one war after the another, and elevating a new geopolitical foe every few years. This can be explained in part by the defense industry s ownership of US mainstream outlets, and the hundreds of millions dollars these Pentagon-linked companies pour into both TV, print and online ads   none of that explains how editors, writers and producers at these outlets can sit there and still claim they are still performing their duty as part of the Fourth Estate.As it stands, mainstream journalism is truly dead in America.On Oct 9, 2016, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said it accurately: We have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive Russophobia that now lies at the heart of U.S. policy towards Russia. It s not just a rhetorical Russophobia, but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security. What Lavrov didn t say is that it has now reached hysterical proportions in US mainstream media circles, where those who call themselves journalists are willing to present virtually anything and call it reporting, even if it s pure hyperbole, so long as it fulfils the anti-Russian narrative.Unfortunately, The Washington Post continues to be a big part of the problem.READ MORE MSM LIES AT: 21st Century Wire MSM FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE NOW & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"November 26, 2016"
23131,Hell Comes to Frogtown: Alt Right and Triumph of Transhumanism,"Deep inside the archetypal psyche of Pepe the Frog Branko Mali  21st Century WireWhile Richard Spencer s half-joke of hailing Donald Trump with Roman salute rose a lot of dust, some remarks in his NPI speech point into rather sinister direction. A posthuman one.  transcript with references and additional a/v material:Undoubtedly, there was a sigh of relief throughout the world when Hillary Clinton lost Presidential elections to Donald Trump. If for nothing else, then for the sake of quiet joy of watching adolescent commissars melt in tears, crying foul over  racism, homophobia, xenophobia  and whateverphobia; it was a joy, and a relief, because it showed monolithic control system of moral nominalism, dubbed  political correctness  to be a paper tiger.However, the party is over and the dialectics are back with the vengeance .As SJWs are, hopefully, moving out from the spotlight of post-historical stage, the new contender asserts his right to fashion the reality of our day and age into his own image.If we are to judge the day by the first gleam of dawn, this image will be just as ugly   and just as unreal   as hermaphrodite ideal of politically correct  shitlib .In the words of more or less universally acclaimed leader of the alternative right, or  Alt Right  movement, Richard Spencer, in the future we are to deal with the leadership of  children of the sun .This is an interesting, and to my mind quite worrisome, statement of intent   a manifestation of will, as Spencer would doubtless rectify me   pointing out in many directions while seemingly focusing on the eternal   and quite unidirectional   circular movement of the pagan deity, revered by all self-respecting  bermenschen   from Nietzsche to postmodern occultists.However, there s a deeper astro-theological metaphor at work here. The  pure eye that can gaze upon overabundance of joy without envy  (Nietzsche) in it s virtual, postmodern, installment is not to be strictly represented by a Swastika   as Spencer apparently assumes, but by other, only seemingly ancient, symbol taken in fact from the world of tabletop and PC gaming and turned into ideological brand by Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin (or his minions): an individual widely promoted by core members of alt right movement.The symbol in question is an eight pointed star signifying the movement, not of sun, but of presumably primordial origin of everything: Chaos.In the lines to follow, we ll provide some preliminary analysis of the emerging situation: the channeling of chaos principle   and adjacent chaos logic   through loosely knit alt right movement, taking as a starting point some statements from Spencer s speech held at NPI Conference in Washington D.C. on November 21st.Triumph of the will, or hipster Babylon working?In introduction to his triumphal encomium to the ideological victory of alt right, embodied in the election of Donald Trump, Spencer makes one interesting remark: But even though we always took Trump seriously, there was still a moment of unreality   or perhaps too painfully intense reality   when the state of Pennsylvania was called for Donald Trump  the moment when we knew Kek had smiled upon us, that meme magic was real. And though these terms are used half-jokingly, they represent something truly important the victory of will. We willed Donald Trump into office, made this dream into reality.  We ll start our explanation with lesser weirdness. Meme  is an expression denoting  inexistent existent , coined apparently by Richard Dawkins to explain how human thoughts fit in his evolutionary theology: memes are thoughts expressed in image and/or phrase which, by circulation in public, acquire the life and subsistence of their own and are able to  infect  the consciousness with their messages, like viruses. A Meme is inexistent because there s no such thing as thoughts having a biologically based self-subsistence and ability to procreate like viruses. Images and/or phrases are not living beings save by bad analogy that omits to tell us on what exactly it is based: what is that one principle making memes and viruses congenial.  Yet they, quite paradoxically, exist because the analogy apparently works. However no one seems to pose the question, why it works.Well, it works because it is magical, in a manner of speaking.Chaos MagickHere we have an example of magical thinking in the postmodern   in fact, post-humanist vein, resting on the assumption that what has not evolved in nature can   and should   be created in analogy to imagined process of evolution. If a artificial construct is in line with a  principle of evolution  it is real or, to be more precise, it is in accordance with imaginary nature of this principle   it is imagined into existence.Therefore  meme magick  works only insofar it relies upon artificial, preferably technological medium for sustenance and on assumption that its recipients identify themselves with their artificial, preferably online identities that can indeed be imbibed with  memes  as they are in themselves artificial and arbitrary constructs.The goal of practitioner of such magic   a far cry from what was traditionally considered to be magic   is to change the world according to his will. This is, more or less, what is known from the Seventies of the last century as chaos magick, a postmodern imitation of  ancient practice of acting in sub-human and sub-natural  domain  of the world, in the past mostly confined to people born with the dubious talent to practice it. The peculiarity of chaos magick is, on the one hand, that it is entirely syncretic, i.e. that it uses everything that its practitioner can imbibe with intended, subjective, meaning, and that it relies on virtual, i.e. artificial world of mass culture, now embodied above all in Internet.The idea behind it all is that nothing is true and everything is possible.There are many interesting implications to this.The first is that everything is interrelated, i.e. that everything is connected with everything else. So any which way you take, you ll get where you want to get if you will it hard enough. The second is that there s no hierarchy of higher and lower   there s only an infinite surface dissolving into ever more complex elements, dissolving in turn into nothingness, if concentrated upon. As there s nothing higher, there s nothing to be revered and everything can   and indeed: should   be an object of ironical laughter. And, most importantly, this is the world of dreams, ruled by what is usually called  dream logic  but in actual fact: chaos logic or un-logic.In this sense, Richard Spencer quite accurately proclaimed Trump s victory an accomplishment of meme   or chaos magick.In theory, Trump is willed into office by Internet memes binding the will of alt right adherents and turning their dream into reality   virtual reality, one may add, yet reality nonetheless. The fact that Trump was elected for a plethora of motives   from the appeal of his politics, to public takedown of Hillary Clinton by Wikileaks   is immaterial, because in the world of chaos every subjective  reality tunnel , or interpretation of the world, is as real as any other.In this sense we can observe the new  God Emperor of USA  as a magical creation of Internet, by the Internet and for the Internet   today still the Internet of interconnected computer nodes, but soon probably the Internet of Things.If one is to push Spencer s remark to it s logical extreme, we can assert that illustrious Donald is the world s first president of posthuman race; an embodiment of a ultra progressive dream invoked to reality by professed ultra anti-progressive group.So that was lesser weirdness. Let us proceed now to high weirdness.Hail Kek!We owe the reader an answer to a question: who the hell is Kek?Well, the reason why Spencer mentions him is again a magickal  half-joke : Kek is interpreted to be an ancient Egyptian deity by a number of Internet observers and identified with alt right memetic avatar   Pepe the Frog. While I habitually suspend judgment on all things Egyptian, because ancient Egyptian culture is a slippery ground even for experts, I consider this interpretation, upon closer inspection, to be quite valid in the virtual light of chaos logic.Namely, Pepe, the cartoon character, conceived in 2005. by cartoonist Matt Furie, emerged as a meme from the depths of Internet forums, more precisely: 4chan sub-forum/pol/, devoted to political discussions with no holds barred, which was, in view of some observers, a breeding ground for many alt right aficionados; a place of absolute freedom, therefore: absolute chaos.The expression  Kek  was also appropriated from the forums and stems from the in-joke among the players of World of Warcraft, replacing the standard Internet abbreviation  LOL  ( laughing out loud ). Someone eventually noticed that Kek is in fact the name of frog-headed Egyptian deity, signifying Chaos and darkness, and Pepe was then rebranded as Kek the deity   an ironic one, no doubt, half joking one, as surprisingly many alt-righters like to put it, but deity nonetheless.It is important to point out that in view of the most  esoteric Kekists , that is: (half grinning) faithful of Kek/Pepe, the association was originally entirely haphazard and accidental, yet it developed into an ever growing system of synchronicities   causally unrelated meaningful relations among events. So it came to pass that Kek sounds very similar to  cuck (originally: cuckservative), a term denoting old fashioned conservative who was still not  red pilled  (another meme taken from pop culture, shared by both alt right and conspiracy theorists) by alt right or, should we assume: Kek himself; furthermore, Hillary Clinton addressed Pepe as nothing less than public enemy, identifying presumably the whole alt right movement with cartoon character. Then it happened that after this act Hillary fainted in front of the cameras, and that was immediately interpreted as an action of Kek. A good run-down of Kek/Pepe/Trump identification.However, it all began with people noticing the numerical synchronicities in the random series of numbers in posts on /pol/ sub-forum: One last thing you need to understand about imageboard culture: dubs.Every post on 4chan and similar venues comes with an 8-digit numerical stamp.  This number represents that post s entry position in the entire posting lineage of the imageboard.With the amount of traffic these sites get, the last couple digits of this number are essentially a random roll.  When a poster gets repeated digits, its called  dubs ,  trips ,  quads , and so on.Since a poster can t know their post number until after they ve submitted the post, its common for people to  bet  the contents of their message on the occurrence of repeating digits ( ) When that endeavor proves a successful, a  GET  has been made and the stroke of luck is celebrated.Out of this practice, a strange phenomenon began to take place on /pol/: discussion threads associated with Trump displayed noticeably frequent GETs.  It wasn t long before all of these seemingly random elements discussed so far became irreparably tied together within imageboard culture: and a god was born.  (source)Synchronicities  related to emergence of Kek the God and his merging with Trump in the bowels of Internet forums early on in the  presidential campaign, are so numerous and, frankly, mind boggling that we cannot list them here, for the sake of brevity. For our purpose it is sufficient to point out that for many alt right aficionados, including core leadership, Kek is the God and Trump is his prophet, all declared with smug grin and ironical stance, yet with all the necessary power of conviction.Namely, chaos magick relies on laughter, or irreverence of its own principles because it is essentially un-principled. Fairly in accordance with its postmodern nature it seeks to deconstruct any kind of order to enable its  practitioner  to impose his own will and change the world   as Spencer would put it: make his dreams a reality.I would go further and add: make all reality a dream; because, chaos magick and alt right are nothing more but novel forms in the development of virtual, i.e. posthuman, world. The idea of adherence and reattachment to tradition that the alt right movement professes is nothing more but simulacrum appealing to people tired of liberal nihilism   in its essence, however, it is a complete opposite: a disintegration of all substantial traditional principles   above all an idea of preexistent hierarchy of Being   into nothingness of primordial Chaos.Posthuman traditionalismI already developed this insight regarding the subversive work of Alexander Dugin, who is probably the most consequent subverter of Tradition with recognizable public persona acting in our age, but now we can see how his affiliates in the USA and Europe are doing the same thing   with less philosophical subtlety, but fueled by much greater raw power. Namely, alt right, if we are to judge by what its leadership advocates, is ideologically nothing more but project of building the simulated tradition   something Richard Spencer likes to call  political theology    founded on New Age filtered Aryan myths, racial interpretation of Nietzsche and generally crossbred with  do your own thing  mentality, all done in the virtual ether of information technology. After all, if we are to agree with Spencer   half jokingly of course   that God Emperor was inaugurated by the act of Kek the God, then the victory of alt right  traditionalists  is in fact the victory of technological magic; the act of pseudo magus waving the same wand Ray Kurzweill and his ilk offer to progressive lunatics.In the end, therefore, we are talking about another victory of posthumanism, branded, spontaneously or otherwise, as  traditionalism.  The obsession of alt right adherents with  identity  in general and  white identity  in particular points to a fact that they are unable to realize the simple truth of Tradition they supposedly defend: they understand identity as something that can be created and not something that must be accepted. Observing the plethora of various, rather eccentric individuals in its vanguard, from macho gay postmodern Spartans to adherents to all kinds of exotic   and to a large extent made up   pagan religions one is at the lack to find a common denominator, save maybe for quite unchallenged neo-Darwinist stance, especially to be found among  game  bloggers as Chateau Heartiste. If someone thinks that he can reattach himself to pre-modern spiritual history of humankind   actually the only one there is   while at the same time musing about  alpha and beta males ,  sexual market ,  signaling and counter-signaling , professing therefore his proud monkey ancestry and reducing human relations to mental GMO of memes, genes and biological analogies   he is doing nothing else than unconsciously subverting the very thing he seemingly defends.The allure of alt right lies in its dialectical opposition to political correctness and rampart destruction of moral substance of the West, induced by process of globalization. Yet this is an eristic or, to use an excellent neologism invented by one correspondent of mine: discordian dialectic; the process of infinite division into ever multiplying opposites founded on the principle of Chaos. It is all done with the crooked half grin, a pinch of salt to every smug remark   with irony of the man who knows he s a liar and a cheat. But smug humor goes just a short way. In the end it morphs into sarcasm and irreverence of what should in fact be revered and subverts the very principles it professes to defend, far more effectively than dead serious PC brigade or techno loonies of posthumanist movement could ever hope for.We ll end with the word of warning to Christian adherents of alt right. The words have a definite meanings and power. There s only one Chaos and there s only one bringer of light from Chaos   as some Kek worshipers already defined the poor Frog s main job. And it s not the One to be defined as  God from God, Light from Light , but  God from Gutter, Light from Darkness . A real Darkness shining in virtual brightness. Hope you guess His name.So, without a pinch of irony, I declare: be careful who your  hail .***Author Branko Mali is a Croatian author and owner of Kali Tribune, with the background in classical philosophy.

23132,The Entire Mainstream Warmongering Media is Fake,"Jay Dyer 21st Century WireIf the Trump phenomena showed anything, it showed the consensus reality the mainstream media attempted to create concerning Hillary s certain victory, as well as the consensus reality erected for decades, is not omnipotent.In fact, the earliest days of mass print media were erected on a famous fraud known as the Great Moon Hoax  of 1835  something researcher Chris Kendall has long called attention to   wherein the  educated,   elite  widely accepted the mainstream publications  claim bat people inhabited the lunar surface.In our day, a similar hoax still reigns, as mainstream media is literally as credible as Weekly World News  Bat Boy story. Orson Wells as Citizen Kane (1941)Anyone who has seen Orson Welles Citizen Kane knows the director became a target of one of the most powerful media moguls of all time   William Randolph Hearst (who bought up all the major papers of his day). Not many years later, Skull and Bonesman  Baal,  aka, Henry Luce of Time Magazine fame and his CIA operative wife Claire Boothe would cooperate in promoting the  anti-establishment  hallucinogenic trend, along with the dozens of academic and government institutions associated with MK ULTRA.What was supposedly anti-establishment was in fact promoted by the mass media for the explicit purposes of cultural revolution and social engineering, as Dave McGowan has detailed in his Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon.The major television news companies, and CBS in particular, have their origins in operatives of the OSS, like William Paley and David Sarnoff, while the same goes for print media, as the CIA s tentacles extended to major publications, including Katherine Graham s Washington Post, the Bushes and the Moonies with the Washington Times, as well as the Mockingbird New York Times. Investigations into the CIA s Operation Mockingbird would reveal extensive media control through some 400 top editors and journalists, and even today known establishment and CIA operatives such as Anderson Cooper (CNN-CBS) and Robert Baer (CNN) regularly  report the facts  to millions of Americans.Journalist Robert Parry notes as a further example the mainstream, establishment press covering up numerous scandals for the Reagan Administration, including Nicaraguan drug trafficking and the infamous Iran-Contra: At least since the 1980s, The New York Times has misreported or glossed over many international issues that put the United States and its allies in a negative light.For instance, the Times not only missed the Nicaraguan Contra cocaine scandal, but actively covered up the Reagan administration s role in the wrongdoing through the 1980s and much of the 1990s.The Times lagged badly, too, on investigating the secret operations that became known as the Iran-Contra Affair. The Times  gullibility in the face of official denials was an obstacle for those of us digging into that constitutional crisis and other abuses by the Reagan administration. [For more on this topic, see Consortiumnews.com s  New York Times: Apologist for Power. ]In that same era, The Washington Post performed no better. Leonard Downie, its executive editor at the time of the Contra-cocaine scandal, has continued to reject the reality of Ronald Reagan s beloved Contras trafficking in cocaine despite the 1998 findings of CIA Inspector General Frederick Hitz that, in fact, many Contras were neck-deep in the cocaine trade and the Reagan administration covered up their criminality for geopolitical reasons. Rumsfeld and Saddam: Old BFFs.This scandal was not limited to the GOP covering its ass, but also the other wing of the decrepit vulture of our two party system when the Clintons were implicated in the CIA s drug importation to Mena, Arkansas, through the journalistic work of Gary Webb. The Telegraph explains: Webb summed up the heart of his Dark Alliance series thus:  It is one of the most bizarre alliances in modern history. The union of a U.S. backed army attempting to overthrow a revolutionary socialist government and the uzi-toting  gangstas  of Compton and South-Central Los Angeles.Perhaps most damningly, Webb wrote that crack was virtually unobtainable in the city s black neighbourhoods before  members of the CIA s army  began supplying it at rock-bottom prices in the Eighties.  For the better part of a decade,  he wrote in the intro to the first piece in the trilogy,  a San Francisco Bay Area drug ring sold tonnes of cocaine to the Crips and Bloods street gangs of Los Angeles, and funnelled millions in drug profits to a Latin American guerrilla army run by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Given the mainstream media is almost wholly owned by 6 conglomerates, we can begin to see how the coordination and control once considered a  conspiracy theory  is now made evident. In 1983, there were 50 and now it is roughly six, with NewsCorp owning the largest papers on three continents. That these facts sound like a  conspiracy theory  can only be presumed from a position of ignorance, especially given the full coordination and deception regarding the Trump   Clinton election of 2016, from rigged polls to Wikileaks revelations of 6o plus top media operatives directly promoting Hillary.When the mainstream media and the lying CIA claimed Saddam had  weapons of mass destruction,  it was promulgating fake news. The false claim subsequently led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis for a ridiculous war that aided U.S. and Israeli foreign policy. While the WMD claim is now known to be untrue, the chemical weapons Saddam previously possessed were admittedly given to him by the CIA. When Saddam gassed Iranians in the conflict that saw U.S. arming of both sides of that war, it was done by a man installed and trained by the CIA (Saddam himself). Foreign Policy explains: According to recently declassified CIA documents and interviews with former intelligence officials like Francona, the U.S. had firm evidence of Iraqi chemical attacks beginning in 1983. At the time, Iran was publicly alleging that illegal chemical attacks were carried out on its forces, and was building a case to present to the United Nations. But it lacked the evidence implicating Iraq, much of which was contained in top secret reports and memoranda sent to the most senior intelligence officials in the U.S. government. The CIA declined to comment for this story.It has been previously reported that the United States provided tactical intelligence to Iraq at the same time that officials suspected Hussein would use chemical weapons. But the CIA documents, which sat almost entirely unnoticed in a trove of declassified material at the National Archives in College Park, Md., combined with exclusive interviews with former intelligence officials, reveal new details about the depth of the United States  knowledge of how and when Iraq employed the deadly agents. They show that senior U.S. officials were being regularly informed about the scale of the nerve gas attacks. They are tantamount to an official American admission of complicity in some of the most gruesome chemical weapons attacks ever launched. And as for Saddam as a tool of the CIA, even the UPI reported, based on Miles Copeland, the following: In the mid-1980s, Miles Copeland, a veteran CIA operative, told UPI the CIA had enjoyed  close ties  with Qasim s ruling Baath Party, just as it had close connections with the intelligence service of Egyptian leader Gamel Abd Nassar. In a recent public statement, Roger Morris, a former National Security Council staffer in the 1970s, confirmed this claim, saying that the CIA had chosen the authoritarian and anti-communist Baath Party  as its instrument. Iraq wasn t the only war-based lie (all wars are a racket, as General Smedley Butler said) of note   the entire tale of 9/11 was never questioned by the mainstream media, but in fact propped by coordinated disinformation. Within minutes, the top media outlets were assuring the public  Osama bin Laden  was the culprit, and what do you know, like Saddam, he happened to be another CIA cut-out asset. Not only was this flimsy official conspiracy theory ludicrous, it was compounded with an equally laughable  raid, capture and execution,  that was not televised, photographed or known, apart from the mainstream media simply claiming it was so. The CIA director even admitted as much, adding the infamous  situation room  photo was staged. . Following 9/11, a paper thin cover for expansion into Afghanistan was proffered upon the American population, when Afghanistan had no connection to 9/11 or Iraq. Incoherent and contradictory accounts of who was the villain, where Osama s cartoonish base was and how this somehow related to Iraq was touted by W, while the media worked fully in tandem with this ridiculous foreign policy. Even more absurd, and confirming the tip of the iceberg Webb had uncovered, U.S. occupation of Afghanistan saw the exponential increase in opium production, with Fox even showing America s finest guarding the opium fields! None of this could have been achieved without a massive coordinating deception campaign by the mainstream media.  The  lies have not been as successful in Syria, but we can expect them to keep the staged nonsense rolling.Jay Dyer is the author of the new book, Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults and Symbols in Film from Trine Day Publishers.

23134,Hillary Clinton Supporters Now Calling for a Recount of Votes in Battleground States," The person who received the most votes free from interference or tampering needs to be in the White House. It may well be Donald J. Trump, but further due diligence is required to ensure that American democracy is not threatened. 21st Century Wire says Although the election was called on Nov 8th, the Democratic Party s ongoing campaign to delegitimize the new incoming President is still ongoing. For those of us with long enough memories, the Democratic Party, their media operatives and the Clinton Campaign were claiming that Trump and the GOP would be engaged in this very same behavior after Hillary Clinton won the Presidency (as expected).Notice how the shoe is now on the other foot.It s interesting reading past stories by  news  sources linked to the Clinton Campaign and John Podesta as Politico has, who ran a feature on Aug 16th entitled,  Why the GOP Will Never Accept President Hillary Clinton  which lays out the case of Hillary s lock on the White House and how the evil Republicans will not accept her eventual election victory. Will Donald Trump respect the peaceful transition of power?  howled CNN s Wolf Blitzer in the run-up to the election. The question now is: will the Democrats respect the result, and simply  Move On,  as they say?Of course, we now know that  journalists  like Wolf at CNN were getting their talking points directly the Clinton Campaign.As it turns out, the only thing illegitimate about the 2016 Election  was the mainstream corporate media. More form the Guardian  John Swane The GuardianA growing number of academics and activists are calling for US authorities to fully audit or recount the 2016 presidential election vote in key battleground states, in case the results could have been skewed by foreign hackers.The loose coalition, which is urging Hillary Clinton s campaign to join its fight, is preparing to deliver a report detailing its concerns to congressional committee chairs and federal authorities early next week, according to two people involved.The document, which is currently 18 pages long, focuses on concerns about the results in the states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. I m interested in verifying the vote,  said Dr Barbara Simons, an adviser to the US election assistance commission and expert on electronic voting.  We need to have post-election ballot audits.  Simons is understood to have contributed analysis to the effort but declined to characterise the precise nature of her involvement.A second group of analysts, led by the National Voting Rights Institute founder John Bonifaz and Professor Alex Halderman, the director of the University of Michigan s center for computer security and society, is also taking part in the push for a review, and has been in contact with Simons.In a blogpost early on Wednesday, Halderman said paper ballots and voting equipment should be examined in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, warning that deadlines were rapidly approaching. Unfortunately, nobody is ever going to examine that evidence unless candidates in those states act now, in the next several days, to petition for recounts,  he said.The developments follow Clinton s surprise defeat to Donald Trump in the 8 November vote, and come after US intelligence authorities released public assessments that Russian hackers were behind intrusions into regional electoral computer systems and the theft of emails from Democratic officials before the election Continue this article at The GuardianREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files ",Middle-east,"November 23, 2016"
23135,"Trump Transition: As Secretary of State, Tulsi Gabbard offers potential for peace with Syria, Russia","Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireSo far as world peace and prosperity goes, most of the names currently being kicked around for America s top diplomatic position do not inspire a great deal of confidence. It s easy to feel uneasy when you see recycled neoconservative hawks like John Bolton and Rudy Giuliani, or old hands like Mitt Romney who previously stated that  Russia is America s greatest threat.   As far as potential picks go for Secretary of State, none is more interesting than the potential that Democratic Congresswoman  Tulsi Gabbard brings to the table. President-Elect Donald Trump invited Hawaii s Gabbard to New York City this week for a meeting regarding possible involvement in the new Presidential Administration. She s got a lot going for her   as an Iraq War veteran with deep understanding of the perils of US interventions overseas, she also brings with her some common sense geopolitical context  a refreshing change from the off-the-shelf, neoliberal interventionist juggernaut previously driven by the hawkish Hillary Clinton, or the flippant public tirades and baseless insults leveled at Russia by the likes of Samantha Power.With an apparently more experienced Romney ahead of her in the queue, Gabbard is certainly a long shot, but considering the mess left behind by eight years of clandestine free for-all and the chronic absent-minded Obama era interventionist policy blunders, not to mention (but we will) the hysterical public meltdowns by US State Dept spokespersons like John Kirby, Jen Psaki and Marie Harf   you can t help but consider the fresh approach that someone like Gabbard might offer.Gabbard (photo, left) also understands the dangers posed by salafist and Wahabi extremists like ISIS, and most certainly would push back against the Obama Administration and the CIA s dubious (and technically illegal, by way of US and international law) policy of arming and supporting various and sundry moderate rebel  extremists (terrorists) in Syria   like Al Nusra Front, Arar al Sham, Nour al-din al-Zenki and many others   all favored by western covert subterfuge teams as instruments of  regime change  in Syria.In terms of independence, Gabbard has already made it clear that her stint would not involve capitulating to her GOP cabinet cohorts, adding that if she was to disagree with President Trump,  I will not hesitate to express that disagreement. Previously, Gabbard was Vice Chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), but suddenly resigned earlier this year in protest after pointing out her party s unfair favoring of Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders during their party s primaries. Following the Wikileaks disclosures, it turns out that Gabbard was on the right side of history, while her detractors in the DNC leadership hierarchy like Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (forced to resign over the Sanders affair was exposed) and Donna Brazile (caught cheating with CNN by passing questions to the Clinton campaign) ended up on the wrong side of history. Here we can see a positive pattern emerging for Gabbard, and it gets better.SEE ALSO: Trump s Foreign Policy: Russia, Syria, Iran and Cabinet NeoconsRegarding foreign policy, Gabbard s stance on Syria is remarkable, and holds great potential for a resolution to the 5 year conflict (not a civil war), as well as a chance to make positive inroads with Russia and other countries who have been perennial foes of both the Obama and Bush Administrations. Because of this, Gabbard has many enemies from on both the Republicans and Democratic chambers alike. Washington, with all of its untoward influence from the cartel of military defense contractor giants, and foreign lobbies like Israel and Saudi Arabia, will not go quietly overnight.In a major departure from the abject failure of the Obama-Clinton-Kerry proxy war debacle in Syria, Gabbard said this about her alignment with Trump policy objectives and diffusing a tense situation in Syria: However, I believe we can disagree, even strongly, but still come together on issues that matter to the American people and affect their daily lives. We cannot allow continued divisiveness to destroy our country  I shared with him my grave concerns that escalating the war in Syria by implementing a so-called no fly/safe zone would be disastrous for the Syrian people, our country and the world,  she said.  It would lead to more death and suffering, exacerbate the refugee crisis, strengthen ISIS and al-Qaeda and bring us into a direct conflict with Russia, which could result in a nuclear war. We discussed my bill to end our country s illegal war to overthrow the Syrian government and the need to focus our precious resources on rebuilding our own country and on defeating al-Qaeda, ISIS and other terrorist groups who pose a threat to the American people. Critics have remarked about her young age (35 years old) and lack of political experience. However, consider how much experience both of the previous Secretary of States had in John Kerry and Hillary Clinton   and yet, they have presided over one unmitigated foreign policy disaster after another, whether in Libya, Syria, Yemen or the Ukraine. Quite possibly, history will look back on these two Obama appointees as the worst ever Secretary of States to hold that position. This is no exaggeration when you pause and take a sober look around the Middle East today.Aside from the novelty of her relative youth in relation to typically older diplomats, Gabbard s authenticity and character comes across in her public speaking, and thus she could be very effective, and no doubt very popular internationally. She s also gone against the party line on Syria. Once again, there she is on the right side of history, while her more experienced party leaders are on stuck on the wrong side. While boldly challenging the party line won t win you any favors in the partisan cesspool of the DC swamp, it shows the sort of character required to lead a team for successful bilateral consensus-building at the international negotiations table. In terms of the US public relations image internationally, this is an intangible benefit that you simply cannot put a price on, because right now, Washington s chief priority should be mending some of the serious rifts left behind by a previously derelict State Dept. Gabbard has the potential to paint US diplomacy in an entirely new light, and a positive one at that. The biggest mistake a Trump White House could make is to place a neoconservative, or hawkish Secretary in place who might help to reboot talking up a war with Iran, or use NATO to press against Russia at its doorstep.So the real question should not be about Gabbard s relative experience, but rather can she be what the previous Secretaries could not   a diplomat.It s a long shot, but she has the potential to mend a fractured Middle East and also revamp relations with Russia   which means a more peaceful and stable world. Not a bad a thought.More from the Trump Transition Team . Shushannah Walshe ABCDemocratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a high-profile Bernie Sanders supporter during the Democratic primaries, is  under serious consideration  for various Cabinet positions in President-elect Donald Trump s administration, according to a senior official on the transition team.According to the official, the 35-year-old Hawaii congresswoman is being looked as a candidate for secretary of state, secretary of defense or United Nations ambassador. If selected, Gabbard will be the first woman as well as the youngest pick for Trump s Cabinet.She met with him this morning in his New York City offices at Trump Tower. The Trump transition source said that their sit-down was a  terrific meeting  and that the Trump team sees her as very impressive.Gabbard, a progressive Democrat, has bucked her party in Congress and during the contentious Democratic primaries. In February she left her position as vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee to support Sanders. In the House she has broken with Democrats on the Syrian civil war (she supports keeping President Bashar al-Assad in power) and Syrian refugees (she voted for a GOP bill last year to conduct stricter background checks on refugees).This afternoon she released a long statement on her meeting with Trump, saying he asked to meet with her about  our current policies regarding Syria, our fight against terrorist groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS, as well as other foreign policy challenges we face.  She said they had a  frank and positive conversation in which we discussed a variety of foreign policy issues in depth.

23136,Mainstream Liars Now Want to be Self-Appointed Monarchs of ‘Truth’,"This biggest failure of the mainstream media was their inability to police themselves. From partisan dishonesty to outright lies   they have destroyed their own credibility, and amazingly, now they want to be the internet s  truth  task force  Neil Clark RT OpEdgeThe Oxford Dictionaries have named  post-truth  as the word of the year.  Fake news  and  post-truth  politics have been blamed for both the Brexit vote in the UK and the victory of Donald Trump in America.It seems the uneducated plebs are falling for  fake news  they read in  new media  and the lies of dreadful rabble-rousing populist politicians who are relying on people s emotions, instead of  objective facts,  to get votes. It s all terribly worrying and poses a dire threat to Western civilization as we know it.Well, forgive me for laughing out loud. For this establishment  fake news / post-truth politics  concern is the funniest thing I ve come across in politics since Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, the very grand Chancellor of the University of Oxford, repeatedly called distinguished Sheldonian guest Mikhail Gorbachev,  Mr. Brezhnev. Why is it so hilarious? Because the people and the outlets warning of the dangers of  fake news  and  post-truth politics  have been the biggest peddlers of  fake news  and  post-truth politics  out there. It s like receiving lectures on the immorality of bootlegging from Al Capone or being told to sit up straight by the Hunchback of Notre Dame.Without a doubt the best, or rather the worst example of  fake news  in the last 25 years or so, was the neocon lie that Iraq had WMDs in 2002/3. That wasn t peddled by  obscure bloggers  and  new media,  but by mainstream Western politicians, from  mainstream  political parties, establishment-approved  experts  on the BBC/ITV/CNN, etc., and Op-ed columnists in  serious  and  respectable  media outlets.@georgegalloway @Independent Tony Blair is a lying warmongering post-truth politician, of course he hates Corbyn. pic.twitter.com/6ZD4FWudyI  Antony Warren (@Lovejoy999) November 20, 2016There was absolutely no evidence that Saddam possessed WMDs. The story was complete and utter BS. Yet this fake news dominated the headlines for months in 2002/3 and led to an illegal invasion in which many people lost their lives. Unlike today s manufactured  fake news  hysteria the Iraq war was no joke. An entire country was destroyed.And guess what? Those who pushed the  Iraq has WMDs line  are now coming on television to express their concern over  fake news !John Hilley notes The BBC even had Alastair Campbell (Tony Blair s spin doctor), in the studio defending the term  post-truth  as a way of exposing the  dangers  of  fake news.' Campbell stated:  It s acknowledging that politics, which has always been rough, has moved to a different phase where politicians who lie now appear to get rewarded for it.  (BBC2 Jeremy Vine Show, 16/11/2016).What might Orwell have said about Campbell, master spinner and Blairite warmonger, sitting inside the BBC being rewarded for his thoughts on  post-truth and  fake news?  Hilley asks.Once again, I m sure old George is spinning in his grave in Sutton Courtenay.Then there s that serial warmonger Bernard-Henri Levy. The Sunday Telegraph today told us in its headlines:  Leading French philosopher: Marine Le Pen may win election as people have lost interest in whether politicians tell the truth. Oh, the irony!Because if the French people really have  lost interest in whether politicians tell the truth,  Henri-Levy and his fellow liberal interventionist  regime changers  have got a lot to do with it. Think back to the war against Libya, which the  leading French philosopher  lobbied hard for. To sell the war to the Western public, we were told that Muammar Gaddafi was about to commit a  Srebrenica-style  massacre in Benghazi. Media Lens noted the claims that were made at the time.But again it was a load of  rollocks.  Five years after Libya, like Iraq before it, had been destroyed by Western  interventionists,  a report of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Commons declared:  the proposition that Muammar Gaddafi would have ordered the massacre of civilians in Benghazi was not supported by the available evidence. It wasn t the only claim made about Libya by Western politicians that was  not supported by the available evidence.  In February 2011, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague insisted that he had seen  information  which suggested that Gaddafi was on his way to Venezuela. An unnamed  diplomat  said that this was  credible information.  But it wasn t. It was the same old fake news that we get every time the Western elites are trying to achieve  regime change. In April 2011 we heard that the devilish Gaddafi (who had not, after all, fled to Caracas), was supplying his troops with Viagra  to encourage mass rape. REVEALED: The Real Fake News List https://t.co/1CkOSe25LU pic.twitter.com/lqb9Uze1pi  Ron Paul (@RonPaul) November 19, 2016 Gaddafi s security forces and other groups in the region are trying to divide the people by using violence against women and rape as tools of war, and the United States condemns this in the strongest possible terms,  declared Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whose supporters are now complaining about  post-truth politics.Again, no evidence was put forward for the Viagra/mass rape claim and, surprise, surprise, none was ever found.A clear pattern can be discerned. To get public support for its illegal regime change wars, the Western establishment energetically promotes a number of  fake news  stories. These stories are usually reported unquestioningly in  respectable  outlets and are regularly cited by neocon/liberal interventionist commentators as a reason for taking action against the target state.  Anonymous  sources feature heavily in these stories, which like MI6 s  Operation Mass Appeal  are often planted by the security services.Meanwhile, people s emotions are shamelessly played upon by the  something must be done  brigade of  liberal  laptop bombardiers, the same crowd, note well, who accuse  populist  politicians of ignoring  objective facts  and playing on people s emotions.The fake news continues while the regime change operation is ongoing. After its over, we re all meant to forget about the false stories we were fed and focus on the next  New Hitler  who needs to be dealt with. In 2011, it was the despicable Gaddafi, now it s the despicable Assad and the despicable Putin who we re told:  have to be stopped. Every time 'MSM' report US-UK government claims of a perceived 'responsibility to protect' Iraqis, Libyans and Syrians, it's fake news.  Media Lens (@medialens) November 19, 2016The term  post-truth  politics implies there was a time when politics was truthful. I doubt if that ever was the case, but certainly in the last 25 years, thanks to the influence of neocons and  liberal interventionists , the lies have been off the scale. Remember the Niger uranium forgeries? And Saddam s horrific  People Shredder ?And before the Iraq war, we had the  humanitarian  NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, where again fake news dominated. US Defense Secretary William Cohen claimed about 100,000 military-aged  Kosovan Albanians were missing   they may have been murdered. As John Pilger reminded us,  Kosovo, the site of a genocide that never was, is now a violent  free market  in drugs and prostitution. It wasn t the only lurid claim that was made to sell the war. But again the  genocide  and hundreds of thousands killed stories were false, as a UN court itself ruled in 2001.Fake news also featured heavily in the neocon campaign to get Iran sanctioned for an entirely unproven nuclear weapons program. It s dominated the coverage of recent events in Ukraine, with Russia s non-existent  invasion of Ukraine  routinely referred to as a fact. The conflict in Syria too has been marked by  fake news,  and theories being reported as if they re 100 percent proven. How many times have you read that  Assad gassed his own people  at Ghouta in 2013, even though we still don t know for sure who carried out the attack?If it s  official enemies  we re talking about  fact-checking  and citing sources isn t all that important for those who pounce on a mere typo if it s an anti-war writer who s making a claim.Now, the same people who have disseminated fake news for so long and who are still, even after Iraq and Libya, embedded in the West s political and media establishments, are lashing out because they no longer control the narrative as they used to. The public is getting their news from a much wider variety of sources and voting for  populist,  i.e., non-neocon/liberal interventionist-anointed candidates/parties at elections.Instead of admitting that it s their  fake news  and  post-truth politics  which has caused people to switch off from establishment media and to stop voting for status quo candidates, the endless war lobby has the effrontery to accuse others of the things they have been guilty of.Concern over  fake news  and  post-truth politics  from the West s endless war propagandists?It s hard to think of a better example of what psychologists call  projection.

23138,New York Times is Advocating for Internet Censorship (controlled by them and other ‘approved’ agents)," The Times asserts that such censorship would be good for democracy   and it surely is true that hoaxes and baseless conspiracy theories are no help to democracy   but regulation of information in the manner that the Times suggests has more than a whiff of Orwellian totalitarianism to it.  Robert Parry  Consortium NewsIn its lead editorial on Sunday, The New York Times decried what it deemed  The Digital Virus Called Fake News  and called for Internet censorship to counter this alleged problem, taking particular aim at Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for letting  liars and con artists hijack his platform. As this mainstream campaign against  fake news  quickly has gained momentum in the past week, two false items get cited repeatedly, a claim that Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump and an assertion that Trump was prevailing in the popular vote over Hillary Clinton. I could add another election-related falsehood, a hoax spread by Trump supporters that liberal documentarian Michael Moore was endorsing Trump when he actually was backing Clinton.But I also know that Clinton supporters were privately pushing some salacious and unsubstantiated charges about Trump s sex life, and Clinton personally charged that Trump was under the control of Russian President Vladimir Putin although there was no evidence presented to support that McCarthyistic accusation.The simple reality is that lots of dubious accusations get flung around during the heat of a campaign   nothing new there   and it is always a challenge for professional journalists to swat them down the best we can. What s different now is that the Times envisions some structure (or algorithm) for eliminating what it calls  fake news. Photograph published by the New York Times purportedly taken in Russia of Russian soldiers who later appeared in eastern Ukraine. However, the photographer has since stated that the photo was actually taken in Ukraine, and the U.S. State Department has acknowledged the error.But, with a stunning lack of self-awareness, the Times fails to acknowledge the many times that it has published  fake news,  such as reporting in 2002 that Iraq s purchase of aluminum tubes meant that it was reconstituting its nuclear weapons program; its bogus analysis tracing the firing location of a Syrian sarin-laden rocket in 2013 back to a Syrian military base that turned out to be four times outside the rocket s range; or its publication of photos supposedly showing Russian soldiers inside Russia and then inside Ukraine in 2014 when it turned out that the  inside-Russia  photo was also taken inside Ukraine, destroying the premise of the story.These are just three examples among many of the Times publishing  fake news    and all three appeared on Page One before being grudgingly or partially retracted, usually far inside the newspaper under opaque headlines so most readers wouldn t notice. Much of the Times   fake news  continued to reverberate in support of U.S. government propaganda even after the partial retractions.Who Is the Judge?So, should Zuckerberg prevent Facebook users from circulating New York Times stories? Obviously, the Times would not favor that solution to the problem of  fake news.  Instead, the Times expects to be one of the arbiters deciding which Internet outlets get banned and which ones get gold seals of approval.The Times lead editorial, following a front-page article on the same topic on Friday, leaves little doubt what the newspaper would like to see. It wants major Internet platforms and search engines, such as Facebook and Google, to close off access to sites accused of disseminating  fake news. The editorial said,  a big part of the responsibility for this scourge rests with internet companies like Facebook and Google, which have made it possible for fake news to be shared nearly instantly with millions of users and have been slow to block it from their sites.  Facebook says it is working on weeding out such fabrications. It said last Monday that it would no longer place Facebook-powered ads on fake news websites, a move that could cost Facebook and those fake news sites a lucrative source of revenue. Earlier on the same day, Google said it would stop letting those sites use its ad placement network. These steps would help, but Facebook, in particular, owes its users, and democracy itself, far more. Facebook has demonstrated that it can effectively block content like click-bait articles and spam from its platform by tweaking its algorithms, which determine what links, photos and ads users see in their news feeds.   Facebook managers are constantly changing and refining the algorithms, which means the system is malleable and subject to human judgment. The Times editorial continued:  This summer, Facebook decided to show more posts from friends and family members in users  news feeds and reduce stories from news organizations, because that s what it said users wanted. If it can do that, surely its programmers can train the software to spot bogus stories and outwit the people producing this garbage.  Mr. Zuckerberg himself has spoken at length about how social media can help improve society.   None of that will happen if he continues to let liars and con artists hijack his platform. Gray AreasBut the problem is that while some falsehoods may be obvious and clear-cut, much information exists in a gray area in which two or more sides may disagree on what the facts are. And the U.S. government doesn t always tell the truth although you would be hard-pressed to find recent examples of the Times recognizing that reality. Especially over the past several decades, the Times has usually embraced the Official Version of a disputed event and has deemed serious skepticism out of bounds.Former New York Times reporter Judith Miller, co-author of the Iraq  aluminum tube  story.That was the way the Times treated denials from the Iraqi government and some outside experts who disputed the  aluminum tube  story in 2002   and how the Times has brushed off disagreements regarding the U.S. government s portrayal of events in Syria, Ukraine and Russia. Increasingly, the Times has come across as a propaganda conduit for Official Washington rather than a professional journalistic entity.But the Times and other mainstream news outlets   along with some favored Internet sites   now sit on a Google-financed entity called the First Draft Coalition, which presents itself as a kind of Ministry of Truth that will decide which stories are true and which are  fake. If the Times  editorial recommendations are followed, the disfavored stories and the sites publishing them would no longer be accessible through popular search engines and platforms, essentially blocking the public s access to them. [See Consortiumnews.com s  What to Do About  Fake News. ]The Times asserts that such censorship would be good for democracy   and it surely is true that hoaxes and baseless conspiracy theories are no help to democracy   but regulation of information in the manner that the Times suggests has more than a whiff of Orwellian totalitarianism to it.And the proposal is especially troubling coming from the Times, with its checkered recent record of disseminating dangerous disinformation.*** Investigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

23139,Hillary Clinton’s ‘KKK’ Smear Against Trump was Democrat Strategy," William McGurn Wall Street JournalLet s get this straight. Calling Hillary Clinton a  bigot  has reporters asking every Republican in sight if Donald Trump has gone too far. But the Clinton campaign releases a video saying Mr. Trump is the candidate of the Ku Klux Klan, and it s all okey-dokey?Then again, Mr. Trump has already been likened to Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin. Small wonder there s a collective ho-hum when Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine says Mr. Trump is peddling  KKK values. This is what Democrats do. It didn t start with Mr. Trump, either. For years Democrats have portrayed the GOP as one giant hate group.Each presidential election, the drill goes like this: After Republicans nominate someone, he immediately finds himself having to prove he s not a hater   of African-Americans, of women, of gays, etc.This year Democrats added a twist. Mr. Trump, they claim, represents a break with all those decent and lovable Republicans such as Mitt Romney, John McCain and George W. Bush. Of course, this isn t what they were saying back when these men were running for president.  In 2000, for example, an NAACP ad recreated the gruesome murder of James Byrd to imply that then-Gov. Bush was sympathetic to lynching black men. Over footage of a chain being dragged by a pickup truck, Mr. Byrd s daughter says,  So when Gov. George W. Bush refused to support hate-crimes legislation, it was like my father was killed all over again.  When John McCain ran in 2008, Barack Obama warned that Republicans would scare people by saying,  You know, he doesn t look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills.  The McCain campaign fired back, accusing Mr. Obama of playing the race card from the  bottom of the deck.  Funny thing: All those reporters always hearing  dog whistles  from Republicans somehow didn t hear this one.  In 2012, when Mitt Romney went to the NAACP and told them face-to-face about his opposition to ObamaCare, the stories were all about how he was really just trolling for the racist vote. Vice President Joe Biden put it more explicitly, telling a largely African-American audience that if Mr. Romney were to win, he d  put ya ll back in chains.

23140,The Great Con: Has Political Correctness Marginalized the Working Class?," Charles Hugh Smith Of Two MindsSo when the protected class of well-paid institutional  progressives  speak darkly of  reversing 40 years of social progress,  what they re really saying is we re terrified that the bottom 95% might be waking up to our Great Con of identity politics and political correctness.To understand the Great Con of political correctness, we must first grasp the decline of the working class (self-described as  the middle class ), i.e. those who must sell their labor to earn their livelihood.Labor s share of the national economy has been declining for 46 years:So where has the wealth that s been generated ended up? In the hands of the .1%:And where did the wages gains end up? In the top 5% technocrat/ managerial class:And what is the technocrat/ managerial class response to this staggering decline in wealth and wages suffered by the bottom 95%? Political correctness.Let s look at political correctness and identity politics through the lens of class warfare and class consciousness. Those enjoying enormous gains in wealth and income have a problem: they must fragment and distract the bottom 95% who have lost income and wealth to the top 5%, lest the bottom 95% realize:1. We have lost the undeclared economic war2. We have more in common economically with others in the bottom 95% than we do with our neofeudal technocrat/ managerial overlords.This unifying class consciousness would threaten the wealth, power and perquisites of the neofeudal technocrat/ managerial class, so they had to undermine an economic awareness of class.They found the perfect weapon in identity politics and political correctness. What better way to fragment the working class than to carve it into cultural subclasses that could be manipulated into declaring war on each other?What better way to mask the collapse of working class political agency than to distract the bottom 95% with fake-Progressive double-speak about  empowerment,   safe spaces  and  micro-aggression ?The heart of the Great Con of identity politics and political correctness is a tragic irony: the more wealth, income and power that slip through the fingers of the bottom 95%, the more their overlords rely on social  empowerment, as if a  safe space  on campus is a substitute for real political and economic agency.That s the Great Con of political correctness: using worthless speech acts about empowerment to distract the working class from its disempowerment in the real world. No amount of  safe space  and happy talk about empowerment can replace meaningful opportunities for economic security and advancement precisely what is abundant for the protected technocrat/ managerial class and scarce for the unprotected 95% that s been sold down the river.The propaganda beauty of class-consciousness-destroying political correctness is its deceptive claim of  progressive. If you set out to design the perfect tool to enforced neofeudalism (the political and economic dominance of the protected few at the expense of the exploited many), you d choose an Orwellian fake-Progressive agenda of cultural fragmentation and conflict that undermines any class consciousness of shared economic disempowerment.This is why the protected technocrat/ managerial class is freaking out about Trump s victory: the inchoate sense that the few have profited at the expense of the many is an expression of an emergent class consciousness that has the potential to threaten the neofeudal dominance of the New Nobility and its self-serving technocrat/ managerial class.So when the protected class of well-paid institutional  progressives  speak darkly of  reversing 40 years of social progress,  what they re really saying is we re terrified that the bottom 95% might be waking up to our Great Con of identity politics and political correctness.Check out Charles Hugh Smith s new book is #8 on Kindle short reads under politics and social science: Why Our Status Quo Failed and Is Beyond Reform ($3.95 Kindle ebook, $8.95 print edition) For more, please visit the book s website.READ MORE PC NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire PC Files",Middle-east,"November 21, 2016"
23141,"Henningsen on Trump’s Foreign Policy: Russia, Syria, Iran and Cabinet Neocons"," 21st Century Wire says While the US media continue to scrutinize President-Elect Donald Trump s transition team over its numerous Cabinet recommendations and nominations, powerful factions within American politics are vying for a seat at the table in a new Trump Administration   and with that comes the power to nudge and influence policy objectives. Trump s Cabinet picks will be a mine field for pursuing previous statements in favor of  a  common sense  foreign policy. Will neoconservative relics and war hawks from the Bush-Cheney era like John Bolton or Rudy Giuliani secure a place in the new Cabinet, and what about the NeoHawks like Sen. Tom Cotton? What would this mean for Syria s Assad and for bilateral relations with Russia, China and Iran? 21WIRE s Patrick Henningsen speaks to Sputnik Radio International this past weekend with his analysis of where thing might be heading Sputnik Radio:  Syrian President Bashar al Assad said he would welcome Donald Trump s decision to fight terrorism. In an interview with a Portuguese TV channel the Syrian head said Damascus cannot predict the policy of the 45th president of the US, but would ally with Washington, if the 70-year-old Republican decides to fight against terrorist groups such as the Islamic State and the Jabhat Fateh al-Sham formerly known as Al Nusra front. During his election campaign Donald Trump said that the Barack Obama administration should give up the idea of regime change in Syria and instead seek the diplomatic solution of the 5-year-old conflict. The US has been conducting airstrikes against ISIS since 2014, however without permission of Damascus.

23143,Robert Parry: What to Do About ‘Fake News’," Robert Parry Consortium NewsIn the wake of Donald Trump s victory, a hot new issue   raised by President Obama in an international setting on Thursday and touted on The New York Times  front page on Friday   is the problem of  fake news  being disseminated on the Internet.Major Internet companies, such as Google and Facebook, are being urged to censor such articles and to punish alleged violators. Also, teams of supposedly  responsible  news providers and technology giants are being assembled to police this alleged problem and decide what is true and what is not.But therein lies the more serious problem: who gets to decide what is real and what is not real? And   in an age when all sides propagate propaganda   when does conformity in support of a mainstream  truth  become censorship of reasonable skepticism?As a journalist for more than four decades, I take seriously the profession s responsibility to verify information as much as possible before publishing it   and as editor of Consortiumnews.com, I insist that our writers (and to the extent possible, outside commenters) back up what they say.I personally hate  conspiracy theories  in which people speculate about a topic without real evidence and often in defiance of actual evidence. I believe in traditional journalistic standards of cross-checking data and applying common sense.So, I am surely no fan of Internet hoaxes and baseless accusations. Yet, I also recognize that mainstream U.S. news outlets have made horrendous and wholesale factual errors, too, such as reporting in 2002-03 that Iraq had reconstituted its nuclear weapons program (The New York Times) and was hiding stockpiles of WMD (many TV and print outlets, including The Washington Post).And, mainstream outlets getting such life-and-death stories wrong was not just a one-off affair around the Iraq invasion. At least since the 1980s, The New York Times has misreported or glossed over many international issues that put the United States and its allies in a negative light.For instance, the Times not only missed the Nicaraguan Contra cocaine scandal, but actively covered up the Reagan administration s role in the wrongdoing through the 1980s and much of the 1990s.The Times lagged badly, too, on investigating the secret operations that became known as the Iran-Contra Affair. The Times  gullibility in the face of official denials was an obstacle for those of us digging into that constitutional crisis and other abuses by the Reagan administration. [For more on this topic, see Consortiumnews.com s  New York Times: Apologist for Power. ]In that same era, The Washington Post performed no better. Leonard Downie, its executive editor at the time of the Contra-cocaine scandal, has continued to reject the reality of Ronald Reagan s beloved Contras trafficking in cocaine despite the 1998 findings of CIA Inspector General Frederick Hitz that, in fact, many Contras were neck-deep in the cocaine trade and the Reagan administration covered up their criminality for geopolitical reasons.More recently, during the mad dash to invade Iraq in 2002-03, the Post s editorial-page editor Fred Hiatt wrote repeatedly as flat fact that Iraq was hiding WMD and mocked the few dissenting voices that challenged the  group think. Yet, Hiatt suffered no accountability for his falsehoods and is still the Post s editorial-page editor, still peddling dubious examples of Washington s conventional wisdom. Ministry of TruthSo, who are the  responsible  journalists who should be anointed to regulate what the world s public gets to see and hear? For that Orwellian task, a kind of Ministry of Truth has been set up by Google, called the First Draft Coalition, which touts itself as a collection of 30 major news and technology companies, including the Times and Post, tackling  fake news  and creating a platform to decide which stories are questionable and which ones aren t.Formed in June 2015 and funded by Google News Lab, the First Draft Coalition s founding members included Bellingcat, an online  citizen journalism  site that has gotten many of its highest profile stories wrong and is now associated with NATO s favorite think tank, the Atlantic Council.Despite Bellingcat s checkered record and its conflicts of interest through the Atlantic Council, major Western news outlets, including the Times and Post, have embraced Bellingcat, apparently because its articles always seem to mesh neatly with U.S. and European propaganda on Syria and Ukraine.Two of Bellingcat s (or its founder Eliot Higgins s) biggest errors were misplacing the firing location of the suspected Syrian rocket carrying sarin gas on Aug. 21, 2013, and directing an Australian news crew to the wrong site for the so-called getaway BUK [missile] video after the July 17, 2014 shoot-down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.( )  Power and RealityWhile it s undeniable that some false or dubious stories get pushed during the heat of a political campaign and in wartime   and journalists have a role in fact-checking as best they can   there is potentially a greater danger when media insiders arrogate to themselves the power to dismiss contrary evidence as unacceptable, especially given their own history of publishing stories that turned out to be dubious if not entirely false.It s even more dangerous when these self-appointed arbiters of truth combine forces with powerful Internet search engines and social media companies to essentially silence dissenting opinions and contrary facts by making them very difficult for the public to locate.( )  On Thursday, an impassioned President Obama voiced his annoyance with  fake news  twice in his joint news conference in Berlin with German Chancellor Angela Merkel    because in an age where there s so much active misinformation and it s packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television.   If everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won t know what to protect. Let that phrase sink in for a moment:  We won t know what to protect ? Is President Obama suggesting that it is the U.S. government s role to  protect  certain information and, by implication, leave contrary information  unprotected,  i.e. open to censorship?

23144,"CNN in a Panic Over Assad Success, Collapse of ‘White Helmets’ Narrative, Fumbling Over ‘Humanitarian Organizations’","By Brandon TurbevilleCNN is in full panic mode with the recent resumption of the Syrian government assault on terrorist-held East Aleppo. The discredited  news  agency is now reduced to rehashing tired and disproven propaganda against the Syrian government and claims that  Assad is killing his own people  by bombing head-chopping terrorists in East Aleppo.You have to hand it to CNN for consistency at least. Cutting edge propaganda, however, is not the corporation s strong suit, since every time it has tried to deliver a major blow, it has resulted in an epic fail  RECYCLED IMAGE: Yesterday, CNN used this recycled, staged image to sell its story, allegedly from a hospital in Aleppo used across US media last month.[Watch CNN reporter Will Ripley s propaganda video here, complete with staged imagery from the US, NATO Member-funded White Helmets and Aleppo Media Centre regime change NGOs]This time, the propaganda of choice is the same tired line that every bomb (excuse me, every  barrel bomb ) being dropped on East Aleppo has been dropped intentionally on top of civilians for the purpose of killing them all because . . . . well, that part has never been explained. But, for the average CNN reader, just know that Assad is a  bad guy  and that the  rebels  who demand veiled, silent, women and full adherence to Sharia law under pain of death are  good guys  and democracy-loving freedom fighters. The regime s siege of rebel-held neighborhoods has triggered a humanitarian catastrophe as food, water and medical supplies run low,  says CNN.Obviously, the humanitarian conditions in East Aleppo have nothing to do with savages and pre-historic bearded freaks running rampant and demanding that their ridiculous interpretation (or should I say  Saudi  interpretation) of their religion be enforced by the blade of a dull knife. It couldn t be because the terrorists have prevented aid from reaching civilians and have actively prevented civilians from leaving East Aleppo to flee to the (*gasp!!) government-held areas. It couldn t be because of the Western sanctions on Syria. It couldn t be because the United States and its treacherous allies funded a proxy army of extremists to destroy the country.No, it s because the Syrian military dared bomb foreign terrorists in East Aleppo. CNN uses interesting logic, indeed.SEE ALSO: RESCUE REDUX: Are Syria s White Helmets  Recycling  its Child Victims?The article laughably uses the notorious terrorist support group known as the White Helmets as its source relaying all the  horrors  of the Assad  regime.  This has been typical of the corporate press in the West ever since the beginning of the Syrian crisis, i.e. using terrorist organizations to cite claims against the Syrian government. Generally speaking, these terrorists are labeled  activists  when a quote is needed but, in the case of the White Helmets, the label of  humanitarian organization  is tossed around, a much more effective propaganda technique.But what is even more deceitful is that CNN also labels the White Helmets and the Syria Civil Defense as the same organization, an absolute fallacy as Vanessa Beeley, the individual who is probably most responsible for exposing this propagandistic terrorist organization, can personally attest to, having met with members of the real Syria Civil Defense in Syria and hearing their stories about the terrorism of the White Helmets. Beeley has also interviewed a doctor with the Aleppo Medical Association who was responsible for assessing East Aleppo refugees who stated clearly that, despite being widely popular in the U.S., the people in East Aleppo simply don t know who the White Helmets are. For them, White Helmets are just another terrorist group.None of this matters to CNN, however, since the corporation is nothing but a mouthpiece for the U.S. State Department, Wall Street, and international corporations. It is, in fact, nothing more than a propaganda site.Perhaps CNN was one of the  fake news  sites that Obama was whining about during his latest trip to Germany . . . .Brandon Turbeville   article archive here   is the author of seven books, Codex Alimentarius   The End of Health Freedom, 7 Real Conspiracies, Five Sense Solutions and Dispatches From a Dissident, volume 1 andvolume 2, The Road to Damascus: The Anglo-American Assault on Syria, and The Difference it Makes: 36 Reasons Why Hillary Clinton Should Never Be President.

23145,Good Riddance: James Clapper Resigns as Director of US Intelligence,"21st Century Wire says Like CIA Director John Brennan, a large part of the job of James Clapper, National Intelligence Director,  was to lie to the American people and to continually exaggerate certain threats,  while trying to conceal real problems   most of which are created by US federal agencies. Like the CIA, this post has become a political one, and a government propaganda mouth piece for the deep state and all its domestic clandestine designs.When asked in 2013 by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR),  Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?    Clapper s reponse was,  No sir. This was a flat out lie, under oath (which seemed to be the norm for all testimonies under 8 years of Obama).Chief among James Clapper s propaganda campaigns directed at the American people   was the greatest politically motivated phony talking point to date: that Russia and its president Vladimir Putin were somehow  hacking  US Elections, while offering no evidence whatsoever to back up this alleged claim by the  intelligence community,  that irresponsible talking point was spun far  out of control and probably set back US-Russian relations years. Clapper claimed that leaked emails posted on WikiLeaks, DCLeaks.com and Guccifer 2.0, were  identified as being associated with Russian intelligence    even though most of the sober world has come to realize this grand conspiracy theory more than likely originated within the White House and the DNC itself.  In a just world, this howler would be a black mark against the credibility of Clapper for the rest of his paid speaking and lucrative conference junket career, but alas, it s not a just world   Clapper will continue to cash in regardless. Maybe that was the intention.There are a number of other things that Clapper said, and did, during his tenure, too many to mention here. More from Adam Garrie  Adam Garrie The DuranIn a first major resignation since Donald Trump s electoral victory, the US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper quit his post.US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has just announced his resignation. This was the man who presided over the US government spying on its citizens and those throughout the world. This scandal was one whose existence Clapper denied, in spite of plain and clear evidence to the contrary.Edward Snowed had exposed numerous constitutional violations during Clapper s reign. This man s exit from the Bush-created position of Director of National Intelligence should be welcomed by everyone who opposes the surveillance state.It has been under Clapper that the government has been cut free of any checks and balances on its use of technology to violate the privacy of ordinary individuals, yet individuals of extraordinary conscience who blow the whistle on the illegal covert activities of government are prosecuted, victimized, and threatened with execution. I m referring specifically to Bradley Manning, Julian Assange and Edward Snowden.Clapper said that he is happy to resign. I personally share in this happiness as will many others. The timing of his resignation, which will be effective in 64 days, is a clear indication that he does not see eye to eye with his incoming boss, Donald Trump.If Clapper is replaced by someone guided by conscience rather than someone who uses George Orwell s 1984 as a handbook rather than a warning, it could well pave the way for the pardon of Manning, Assange and Snowden.One can only hope that Donald Trump does the right thing.READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"November 19, 2016"

23147,Dyer: ‘LA Times ‘Fake News’ Article is an Attack on Independent Media’,"Jay Dyer 21st Century WireAccording to a recent feature article published by the LA Times, and which has since gone viral, this website, 21st Century Wire, has been placed at the top of a  list  of  fake  news sites compiled by Dr Melissa Zimdars, an associate professor at Merrimack College in Massachusetts. Aside from being a highly political attempt to discredit a number of online news source which Dr Zimdars and the Democratic Party establishment probably labels as  Alt Right,  this coordinated effort also points directly to a much deeper agenda, as part of a larger as psychological operation to create an algorithm for  filtering  (censoring) news items on major internet platforms and social networks.I take that to heart, since I write for 21WIRE. It s no coincidence that this LA Times hit piece comes in the same week that Democratic Party pundits and leaders are blaming Hillary Clinton s loss to Donald Trump on  fake news  posted on Facebook which they claim wrongly influenced voters. Also just by coincidence this week, Facebook, Google and other DNC affiliated Silicon Valley media partners have announced they are planning to draw-up lists of numerous alternative media websites including  right wing  websites as well as known satire sites, and ours  as  fake.  Google and Facebook will then be able to flag and restrict banned websites from being able to earn revenue through their advertising networks. Of course, the real reason for this is explained in my video (watch below) outlining the absurdity of the most astounding liars on the planet   the Mainstream Media  accusing websites like ours as pushing out fake news.  Ultimately, this is an attack on all independent media.It seems that Dr Zimdar s master list  was made to place 21WIRE at the top   and yet, it s perhaps the best site on the list and is the only one that has  been to Syria,  reported on the ground in Aleppo, and even met with Syria  president Assad   all things that most corporate mainstream media outlets have not managed to do. 21WIRE also blasted faux NGO the White Helmets away as a western-funded propaganda front. 21WIRE is subject to regular DDoS attacks and regularly does real journalism. It is also edited by accredited journalists and is frequently featured on radio and television. That is why it has been targeted in this hit piece   because it is independent and not attached to any political party.Watch my video analysis here: ***Jay Dyer is the author of the new book, Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults and Symbols in Film from Trine Day Publishers.

23149,SHIFTING PARADIGM: You’ll Only Understand Trump and Brexit If You Understand the Failure of Globalization,"21st Century Wire says It s hard to not to draw a comparison between the Brexit referendum and the stunning surprise victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election in America. Many now argue that both were a repudiation on globalization.Indeed, anxiety over the global economy as a whole contributed to 2016 s historic rejection of the status quo: big trade, big banks and Wall Street.Yesterday in his overseas speech, even President Obama acknowleged that the globalized policies of the world have absolutely contributed to a political upheaval that has given rise to Brexit vote and a Trump presidency: The current path of globalization demands a course correction,  adding Any legislation that is proven flawed can be corrected through the process of democracy. Earlier this year, conservative leaning Washington Times discusssed the nature of falied policy that has led to such sluggish growth in the US over the past 7-8 years: The previously bullish Fed finally and openly acknowledged that sluggish growth is the long term new normal for America. Secular stagnation is here to stay. The growth rate has limped out of the 2008-09 recession at a 2 percent pace now for seven years. The Joint Economic Committee of Congress tells us a normal recovery gives us about 3.5 percent growth and the Reagan and JFK booms were closer to 4 percent. So the GDP today thanks to President Obama is about $2 to $3 trillion smaller than it should be. This is roughly the equivalent of losing the entire annual output of every business and worker in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana combined.Instead of speeding up to recover all this lost ground, we re decelerating. Growth was 1.4 percent in the 4th quarter of 2015. It was 0.8 percent in the first quarter of this year. The Fed now has downgraded growth now to less than 2 percent for the rest of 2016   down from an original forecast of 2.4 percent. One day after the US election, The Intercept s Glenn Greenwald (of Snowden fame) captured the frustartion that led to the Brexit vote and Trump s win. Here s a short passage from his piece: The institutions and elite factions that have spent years mocking, maligning, and pillaging large portions of the population  all while compiling their own long record of failure and corruption and destruction  are now shocked that their dictates and decrees go unheeded. But human beings are not going to follow and obey the exact people they most blame for their suffering. They re going to do exactly the opposite: purposely defy them and try to impose punishment in retaliation. Only time will tell what the future holds for Brexit or Trump   but for the moment, the voice of the everyday man has been heard loud and clear.More from Washington s Blog below  (Image Source: Onmanorama). Washington s BlogTrumpTrump made rejection of globalization a centerpiece of his campaign. In his July 21st acceptance speech as the Republican nominee, he said:Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.The Boston Globe bannered this headline on Thursday:   Trump won. Globalization lost. Now what? On election night, CNN s Jake Tapper explained that many Americans voted for Trump because they are sick of the income inequality, globalization, and politics-as-usual that the status quo have given us. He pointed out that only a handful of people have gotten rich off of globalization, and a lot of people have been left behind.Counterpunch wrote Friday:The real meaning of this upset is that Wall Street s globalization project has been rejected by the citizens of its homeland.***Trump voters had several reasons to vote for Trump other than  racism .  Most of all, they want their jobs back, jobs that have vanished thanks to the neoliberal policy of transferring manufacturing jobs to places with low wages.BrexitSimilarly, Brexit was largely a vote against globalization.For example, the Guardian ran an article in June explaining,  Brexit is a rejection of globalisation :Britain s rejection of the EU. This was more than a protest against the career opportunities that never knock and the affordable homes that never get built. It was a protest against the economic model that has been in place for the past three decades.***Europe has failed to fulfil the historic role allocated to it. Jobs, living standards and welfare states were all better protected in the heyday of nation states in the 1950s and 1960s than they have been in the age of globalisation. Unemployment across the eurozone is more than 10%. Italy s economy is barely any bigger now than it was when the euro was created. Greece s economy has shrunk by almost a third.***Inevitably, there has been a backlash, manifested in the rise of populist parties on the left and right. An increasing number of voters believe there is not much on offer from the current system. They think globalisation has benefited a small privileged elite, but not them. They think it is unfair that they should pay the price for bankers  failings. They hanker after a return to the security that the nation state provided, even if that means curbs on the core freedoms that underpin globalisation, including the free movement of people.***Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, analysed the voting patterns in the referendum and found that those parts of Britain with the strongest support for Brexit were those that had been poor for a long time. The result was affected by  deeply entrenched national geographical inequality , he said.There has been much lazy thinking in the past quarter of a century about globalisation. As Bell notes, it is time to rethink the assumption that a  flexible globalised economy can generate prosperity that is widely shared. But What Do the Experts Say?Mainstream economists, organizations and politicians   including the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (and see this), McKinsey & Company and Obama  now admit that globalization creates inequality. People worldwide are furious at runaway inequality   and it s affecting elections globally.The Bank of International Settlements   the  Central Banks  Central Bank   says that financial globalization itself makes booms and busts far more frequent and destabilizing than they otherwise would be.The Economist pointed out in July:Most economists have been blindsided by the backlash [against globalization]. A few saw it coming. It is worth studying their reasoning  .David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson have documented how the costs of America s growing trade with China has fallen disproportionately on certain cities. And so on.Branko Milanovic of the City University of New York believes such costs perpetuate a cycle of globalisation. He argues that periods of global integration and technological progress generate rising inequality  .Supporters of economic integration underestimated the risks both that big slices of society would feel left behind  .The New York Times reported in March:Were the experts wrong about the benefits of trade for the American economy?***Voters  anger and frustration, driven in part by relentless globalization and technological change [has made Trump and Sanders popular, and] is already having a big impact on America s future, shaking a once-solid consensus that freer trade is, necessarily, a good thing. The economic populism of the presidential campaign has forced the recognition that expanded trade is a double-edged sword, wrote Jared Bernstein, former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.What seems most striking is that the angry working class   dismissed so often as myopic, unable to understand the economic trade-offs presented by trade   appears to have understood what the experts are only belatedly finding to be true: The benefits from trade to the American economy may not always justify its costs.In a recent study, three economists   David Autor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, David Dorn at the University of Zurich and Gordon Hanson at the University of California, San Diego   raised a profound challenge to all of us brought up to believe that economies quickly recover from trade shocks. In theory, a developed industrial country like the United States adjusts to import competition by moving workers into more advanced industries that can successfully compete in global markets.They examined the experience of American workers after China erupted onto world markets some two decades ago. The presumed adjustment, they concluded, never happened. Or at least hasn t happened yet. Wages remain low and unemployment high in the most affected local job markets. Nationally, there is no sign of offsetting job gains elsewhere in the economy. What s more, they found that sagging wages in local labor markets exposed to Chinese competition reduced earnings by $213 per adult per year.In another study they wrote with Daron Acemoglu and Brendan Price from M.I.T., they estimated that rising Chinese imports from 1999 to 2011 cost up to 2.4 million American jobs. These results should cause us to rethink the short- and medium-run gains from trade,  they argued.  Having failed to anticipate how significant the dislocations from trade might be, it is incumbent on the literature to more convincingly estimate the gains from trade, such that the case for free trade is not based on the sway of theory alone, but on a foundation of evidence that illuminates who gains, who loses, by how much, and under what conditions.

While the Democratic Party are hoping to leverage these street action into votes in 2017 and 2018, the real strategy here seems to be about forging deeper narratives and creating a collective feeling of  disenfranchisement among liberal millennial. It may appear like a grassroots uprising, but upon closer inspection, there big money and big players behind it all.Within 24 hours of the dramatic conclusion to 2016 presidential election on November 8th, highly organized flash mobs directed in part by the Democratic Party s leading  community organizing  digital platform, MoveOn.org (funded by Wall Street billionaire and top Clinton donor George Soros) spread rapidly throughout several cities across America including Oakland, Los Angeles, New York and Portland. While vitriolic anti-Trump dissent consumed some urban parts of the country, mainstream media outlets, as well as a column of Hollywood celebrities and entertainers added to the disillusionment as they took to the airwaves and social media to express their shock and emotional fears that a Trump presidency would be  the end of the world,  for some anyway.Readers would not be amiss in questioning the true nature of the heavily coordinated color revolution-style MoveOn marches across America, as they reveal a much deeper social engineering agenda at play   one that enlists a likely coalition comprised of corporate media outlets, Silicon Valley, along with Hollywood  together peddling a highly reactionary, if not incendiary political message.Make no mistake: this is a well-financed and concerted attempt to further divide America   along new cultural lines of identity   a division which will eventually benefit the same elite establishment which both the popular left and the popular right believe they are currently railing against.Let s review the impetus behind the anti-Trump protests, before discussing the unusual nature of an outright rejection of the democratic process by organized oprotesters   quietly nudged by Hollywood and media operatives MOVE ON: A Manufactured March On America For nearly a week, street protests have been promoted by the same mainstream news networks that had predicted a Hillary Clinton landslide only eight days ago.Networks like CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times and the Washington Post are still reluctant to report how within hours of the election result, the Soros-tied NGO MoveOn.org issued a press release calling for nationwide protests. This was followed by petitions to  Abolish the Electoral College. In my first report discussing this potentially explosive situation unfolding across America, it was shown how MoveOn members had created more than 200 gatherings nationwide, with the number continuing to grow   What this demonstrates more than anything is how the amalgamation of virtual community-based flash mobs and professional political agitators have been fostered by various Democratic party NGO s since the early 2000 s   not only through MoveOn.org, but also through Democratic Party affiliated foundations like Answer Coalition.In addition to Soros s billions being poured into a near endless web of political front organization and  change agent  NGOs, other Wall Street financial institutions have backed their favorites, like Goldman Sachs and others, sponsoring the Hillary Clinton campaign and maintaining strong stakes the Clinton Foundation as well as ties to Clinton family in general. In 2015, the Washington Post reported that  Hillary Rodham Clinton and former president Bill Clinton earned in excess of $25 million for delivering 104 speeches since the beginning of 2014, a huge infusion to their net worth as she was readying for a presidential bid. Here we see an example of the financial nexus formed between powerful players like Soros, Wall Street s Goldman Sachs   and America s  progressive  leftwing political establishment. Clearly, there is a high level agenda at work here, and you only need to follow the money to see who are the chief beneficiaries.SEE ALSO: PARTNERS IN CRIME: Goldman Sachs, The Clintons & Wall StreetSome of the most notable uprisings in America include the designer social justice campaigns   all of whom have George Soros money behind them through a vast network of foundations and social front groups   like The Occupy Movement  (aka OWS) in 2011, as well as Soros funded protests in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, and the Black Lives Matter (BLM) street action group this past year. Each of these have a common thread   they have all  evolved into some form of violent social unrest often steered by paid provocateurs. Media outlets generally do not like to cover this side of the events because it simply doesn t fit the favored  Left vs Right  narrative the media loves so much. Hence, most members of the public   especially the protesters themselves   have little or no idea what is driving street violence and the  crisis  narrative.One wonders whether Soros an ideologue, or a business speculator? Maybe both. Soros boast about  taking down  foreign nations and capitalizing on subsequent market tremors, but his conquests are certainly not limited to overseas targets.Media ManipulationIn 2011, the same year as the OWS protests, it was reported that National Public Radio (NPR) accepted a $1.8 million dollar grant from the George Soros founded The Open Society Institute rebranded as the Open Society Foundations (OSF). The NGO managed to gain even greater influence on NPR s reportage. Below is a passage describing the Soros funded Impact on Government project: NPR is using the two-year grant as seed money to start a local-national initiative, known as the Impact on Government project. Eventually, the plan is to have two public radio reporters in every state keeping tabs on state government issues that are woefully under-reported by the media. This is to be a multi-media project for radio, the Web and social media. Many critics of the collaboration charged that NPR joined the ranks of many other media outlets funded by Soros. According to the conservative watchdog, Media Research Center there has been an additional $48 million taken by media outlets from Soros tied NGO s since 2003: It turns out that Soros  influence doesn t just include connections to top mainstream news organizations such as NBC, ABC, The New York Times and Washington Post. It s bought him connections to the underpinnings of the news business. The Columbia Journalism Review, which bills itself as  a watchdog and a friend of the press in all its forms,  lists several investigative reporting projects funded by one of Soros foundations. In August of 2016, it was reported that  DCLeaks.com   which claims to be run by the same hackers who leaked a trove of e-mails from the Democratic National Committee (DNC)   has published a 69-page report from OSF in which the Soros organization documents its plans to use the  unrest  following the death of Freddie Gray to  accelerate the dismantling of structural inequality generated and maintained by local law enforcement,  and that George Soros s Open Society Foundations approved a $650,000 dollar donation to BLM: Recognizing the need for strategic assistance, the U.S. Programs Board approved $650,000 in Opportunities Fund support to invest in technical assistance and support for the groups at the core of the burgeoning #BlackLivesMatter movement. Additionally, here s a passage from the leaked OSF documents that discusses the social engineering used to influence policy change: The latest example of Black Lives Matter follows upon previous social movements that have taken very different paths, including the Dreamers and Occupy Wall Street, which call into question the role that philanthropy should play in supporting, encouraging, and/or building these social movements as they evolve to affect real policy change and sometimes though not always  transition into longer-term institutions. The end of result of the media manipulation and street actions driven by engineers like Soros is that misinformed members of the public will exact violence against innocent bystanders.Here s a YouTube video depicting 49-year-old David Wilcox being violently attacked by a mob (following a minor traffic accident in Chicago) after he was labeled a  White  Trump supporter https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7zEibNcejAHere s another video on YouTube featuring a Chicago Tribune interview with a bruised and battered Wilcox, days after a street mob attacked him WARNING: Adult language   please be advised: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr_17ZCJLg8Back in August, a Wikileaks email dump revealed a message sent by George Soros to then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. In the email, Soros himself gave explicit instructions on how to handle the social unrest occurring in Albania in January of 2011. Here s a passage of the Soros message to Clinton. An important thing to remember   to date, Wikileaks findings have yet to be unproven: There are serious concerns about further unrest connected to a counter-demonstration to be organized by the governing party  and a follow-up event by the opposition two days later to memorialize the victims,  Soros says. The prospect of tens of thousands of people entering the streets in an already inflamed political environment bodes ill for the return of public order and the country s fragile democratic process,  he adds. I believe two things need to be done urgently,  he adds. 1. Bring the full weight of the international community to bear on Prime Minister Berisha and opposition leader Edi Rama to forestall further public demonstrations and to tone down public pronouncements.2. Appoint a senior European official as a mediator. Soros suggested three candidates: Carl Bildt, Martti Ahtisaari, and Miroslav Lajcak, saying all  have strong connections to the Balkans. The US and the EU must work in complete harmony over this, but given Albania s European aspirations the EU must take the lead,  he stressed, adding that his foundation in Tirana was  monitoring the situation closely and can provide independent analysis of the crisis. Democracy Alliance Plots RevengeThe Soros controlled NGO machine continued this week when it was revealed that the Soros funded Democracy Alliance was set to  retool  those groups being used to rattle president-elect Trump: George Soros and other rich liberals who spent tens of millions of dollars trying to elect Hillary Clinton are gathering in Washington for a three-day, closed door meeting to retool the big-money left to fight back against Donald Trump.The conference, which kicked off Sunday night at Washington s pricey Mandarin Oriental hotel, is sponsored by the influential Democracy Alliance donor club, and will include appearances by leaders of most leading unions and liberal groups, as well as darlings of the left such as House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chairman Keith Ellison, according to an agenda and other documents obtained by POLITICO.  In an interesting twist, FOX News revealed that a Craigslist ad (image, above) found to be connected to the anti-Trump protests may also be linked to a Planned Parenthood affiliate. The following is a passage from that report: The Craigslist ads read:  STOP TRUMP   up to $1500/week. Hiring immediately! Call Today Start tomorrow! $15-$18 hourly rate + bonus + overtime up to 77 hours per week!They were placed by a Planned Parenthood affiliate in major cities like Boston, Denver, Columbus, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh right before the election to defeat the candidacy of Donald Trump. However, most of them are still active on Craigslist, fueling questions about whether the group is now among those feeding the post-election anti-Trump protests across the country. Its no secret Planned Parenthood has taken a strong stance on Trump s views of their organization, making it likely they would attempt to thwart the president-elect.FOX News also mentioned that Planned Parenthood received  $553.7 million in tax dollars last year, [and] had pledged to spend $30 million to defeat Trump, according to Rolling Stone. There is a decidedly edgy public persona of Soros linked NGO s and their splinter protest groups such as BLM, yet the mainstream media is soft on many of the various group s objectives. In a NY Times article this was recently confirmed as  Cat Brooks, a co-founder of Anti Police-Terror Project, told a crowd in Oakland on Friday.  We need to be more than angry, we need to organize and funnel our anger into action. Polling America & the Celebrity  Crisis  Post-TrumpAs 21WIRE previously outlined, there where great webs spun by think-tanks and media with regards to the statistical outcome of the 2016 presidential election in America: One of the great myths being spun by the establishment media was that Donald Trump had no support from women, latinos and blacks in the US. As it turned out, this was a lie propagated in a failed attempt to margnalize Republican voters and give a false impression of a liberal Democratic mandate in America. In the end Trump gathered 29% of Latinos, 9% of African Americans and 49% of college educated white women. For months, mainstream media pundits and polls insisted that all of these demographics were exclusively for Hillary Clinton. Here s another look at the psychologist and internet radio personality Kiki Green, who passionately explains the symbiotic relationship between the Democratic Party, Hollywood and the Clinton campaign   all who worked in concert to dupe certain groups into voting for Hillary Clinton WARNING: Adult language please be advised:  To top it off, actor Robert DeNiro, who once played the politically obsessed character Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, threatened to punch Donald Trump before the election, and is now said to be woefully  depressed  following the Real Estate mogul s historic win.Here s DeNiro s cheap attempt at swaying voters a month before the US election. Watch as the actor name drops Colin Powell to somehow delegitimize Trump. Powell of course was one of the neoconservative architects of the false WMD narrative that led to the Iraq invasion in 2003 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzhjpWbGM5sThe Hollywood hits against Trump haven t stopped there, over the past 24 hours, Dreamworks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg penned an  open letter  discussing the Trump victory. Katzenberg himself was a seven-figure donor ($1 million) to the Clinton friendly super PAC Priorities USA Action. Here s a passage of Katzenberg s piece published at the Hollywood Reporter: I have been involved in politics for more than 50 years, and this is certainly not the first time I ve been on the losing end. It always hurts. And this one maybe hurts more than the rest   partly because we didn t really lose. Our side got more popular votes, while Trump received fewer votes than Mitt Romney or John McCain. The Electoral College is how we choose presidents, and I (mostly) respect this. But I hope everyone, including Mr. Trump, recognizes that this was not an election that, by any stretch, resulted in a mandate. Interestingly, Katezenberg s emotive plea proved to be heavy-handed with the takeaway that Trump really didn t win, as he explains his candidate Clinton,  didn t really lose  the popular vote. While its true, the Clinton camp received a total of 62,522,062 to Trump s 61,300,582, some 1,221480 votes separate the pair across America   it should also be mentioned that Trump did far better in the all important swing-states, which statistically speaking, usually define most presidential elections.According to the Cook Political Report, which provides up-to-date 2016 election analysis, Trump s margin in swing-states was overwhelmingly in his favor with the president-elect garnering 22,055,535 to Clinton s 21,181,776 throughout 13 swing-state totals. The final swing-state tally gave Trump an 873,759 votes more. One other notable stat showed how Clinton gained her vote total (not mentioning the 14 cases of voter fraud reported), as it was hinged on one state, California. In fact, Clinton received 6,633,714 to Trump s 3,541,015 in the highly democratic state that holds a population of 39.35 million according to census reports.So, just as a caveat to Katzenberg s plea used to distort public opinion   without California, a massively left-leaning state, Clinton wouldn t be anywhere near Trump s numbers. Like Trump or not, he was a clear winner of 2016 and got votes where it counted the most.  PROGRAMMING PROTEST?    Soros linked groups are distorting the public s perception with their organized color revolution-style protests. (Image Source: the news at 9)Color Revolutions & Smart Mobs Whether in the flesh, social media or through mainstream TV, the populace is subject to various forms of hyperreal propaganda around the global   in many ways this is being used to push certain political regime changes and party objectives through the use of deceptive color revolutions and their many incarnations.In a recent article discussing how the Pentagon reportedly paid PR firm Bell Pottinger $540 million to produce fake terror videos used to steer Western political interests, we also explored the psychological aspect to social engineered color revolutions. Here s a passage from the 21WIRE report below: The scale of such US-sponsored social engineering projects are breathtaking. In June of 2014, in an article entitled,  Pentagon preparing for mass civil breakdown,  by Nafeez Ahmed, published at the UK s Guardian, we learned that:A new  research programme is funding universities to model the dynamics, risks and tipping points for large-scale civil unrest across the world, under the supervision of various US military agencies. The program was brought to fruition during the height of the banking crisis in 2008, as Ahmed points out, suggesting it was already in the works for some time   and time was of the essence.The social science study may have been as big or bigger then the Snowden documents on NSA bulk collection, where not only are Americans being tracked but their behavior is being categorized, labeled and scrutinized, prompting those who value civl rights and privacy to question the ethics and morals of such a US government program. The Guardian article also outlined the type of militarized language used to describe civil movements promoting political change, ironically they used the NGO/US State Department engineered uprising in Egypt as a model for one social science study: Among the projects awarded for the period 2014-2017 is a Cornell University-led study managed by the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research which aims to develop an empirical model  of the dynamics of social movement mobilisation and contagions.  The project will determine  the critical mass (tipping point)  of social contagians by studying their  digital traces  in the cases of  the 2011 Egyptian revolution, the 2011 Russian Duma elections, the 2012 Nigerian fuel subsidy crisis and the 2013 Gazi park protests in Turkey. Essentially, this is computer modelling of  color revolutions  over sees  an expensive digital tool in the Pentagon and the CIA s  regime change  operations. The blending of socially engineered political agitator mobs and color revolutions is becoming more and more imperceptible as any group-think meme can cause a sudden flash gathering for the cause of the day.In a book from 2011 written by Susanne Elizabeth Shawyer entitled  Radical Street Theatre and the Yippie Legacy: A Performance History of the Youth International Party, 1967 1968,  we gain a clearer perspective of the term  Smart Mobs   and the nature of these cross-platform gatherings: The potential for ideological uses of flash mobs soon became clear by autumn 2003. Because of its original apolitical nature and network organization, the flash mob was easily appropriated for other means beyond random fun. Flash mobs were soon used for political or commercial end by those seeking to capitalize on the trendy cultural capital of flash mobs. Adding to that, Shawyer cites author social science critic Howard Rheingold, who penned a book entitled  Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution  in 2003 and continued to outline the nature of smart mobs: A smart mob may be composed of strangers who have no relationship to each other beyond their mutual connection to the network, yet this connection creates a virtual community and provides the opportunity for collective action. Taking the smart mob phenomena and grafting it onto the recent anti-trump riots in Portland, Oregon, we can see how a large block of people can become useful provocateurs, paid or otherwise.  PORTLAND RIOT    Are NGO s stirring the masses in America? (Image Source: thewashingtonpost)According to the local Portland NBC affiliate KGW: More than half of the anti-Trump protesters arrested in Portland didn t vote in Oregon, according to state election records. At least sixty-nine demonstrators either didn t turn in a ballot or weren t registered to vote in the state.KGW compiled a list of the 112 people arrested by the Portland Police Bureau during recent protests. Those names and ages, provided by police, were then compared to state voter logs by Multnomah County Elections officials.Records show 34 of the protesters arrested didn t return a ballot for the November 8 election. Thirty-five of the demonstrators taken into custody weren t registered to vote in Oregon. Earlier this year, we discussed how political game changers had been targeting the Trump campaign, as the George Soros-funded Democrat Party-oriented advocacy group MoveOn.org and host of other splinter groups associated with Black Lives Matter, played a large role in the Chicago University student-organized shutdown at a Trump campaign rally.Since then, numerous protests and violent confrontations were organized, serving as a disruptive force during the US election cycle. Left-wing critics routinely cited Donald Trump as the reason for the all the high-profile confrontations, trying to rationalize how he is somehow attracting the flash mob   when in reality the flash mobs are being organized via a few foundation-funded  community organizing  portals like MoveOn.org.The Role of Hollywood & Media When you mix the Hollywood molotov commentary with that of the socially engineered flash mob, you have a designer reality that big media uses to polarize the public over certain political outcomes, giving them the ability to blame any other group not associated with the group-think entity.Media outlets have also played a role in perpetuating the mass victimization meme spread throughout America with headlines like  Anti-Trump demonstrators say nationwide protests are  just a taste of things to come ,   published at The Washington Post,  Bullying in the Age of Trump,  published by the NY Times,  Campuses Confront Hostile Acts Against Minorities After Donald Trump s Election,  also published at the NY Times  all stories designed to create an emotional reaction rather than a rational one.In fact, there s been a wave of false claims levied at Trump supporters as  sanctuary sites  are being rolled out on college campuses for those in need of Trump recovery and now, reportedly New York City high school reportedly allowed their students to skip class Tuesday to join protests at the Trump Tower despite objections from fellow educators, along with a lesson plan on Trump s behavior.Here are two YouTube clips depicting celebrity meltdowns over Trump s presidential win. Interestingly, the Hollywood  crisis  on display below is designed to manipulate young Americans taken in by the celebrity-generated drama   more likely an attempt to graft psychological trauma onto an unsuspecting viewer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjZoljZcVcwhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlBNQ5AEGUYThis definitely represents a low ebb in American culture, and in history too.READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE NOW & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"November 17, 2016"
23151,‘Trumping’ America’s Liberal Elite: The Failure of Political Correctness,"Kirsten Powers USA TodayOver the past 18 months, whether in Midwestern airports or New Hampshire and Iowa hotels, I learned the best way to spot a Donald Trump supporter was to note who was remaining silent.As Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz or John Kasich voters enthusiastically shared their reasons for supporting their candidate, a family member or friend would often stand by quietly.When pressed, if they came clean, it was often with downcast eyes or an apologetic smile: I m voting for Trump,  they d almost whisper.A few months ago, an Uber driver told me he was voting third party, then tepidly announced he was voting Trump as I exited the car. Why didn t he just tell me this in the first place, I asked. Because I thought you would judge me,  he said.Here we can see why Donald Trump s constant inveighing against political correctness was so ingenious. It forged an unlikely but unshakable bond between a Manhattan billionaire who had manifestly lived a life of  New York values  with conservative white Americans who feel under constant assault by a cultural elite that treats them with contempt. Perhaps more importantly, it ultimately inoculated Trump against allegations that many believed would be his undoing: that he was a racist and misogynist who bragged of sexually assaulting women. Trump s success among women was in part a reaction against enforced political correctness (Image Source: Pulse.ng)After all, these same voters have watched as every Republican candidate in recent memory has been accused of waging a  War on Women. If Democrats are going to claim that Mitt Romney and John McCain hate women (and they did), then they shouldn t be surprised when voters ignore them when they say Donald Trump hates women. If every Republican is a misogynist, then no Republican is.While many liberals have dismissed the idea of political correctness as a right-wing manufactured hysteria, it is in fact a real thing. That Trump has stretched its meaning to encompass pretty much any horrible thing he wants to say makes its existence no less real.Conservative white Americans have watched (often fearfully) as liberal cultural elites demand that everyone fall in line with their agenda or risk being called a homophobe, racist or misogynist. The concept of persuasion and debate has been overridden by a quest for immediate and forced cultural conformity. My friend Sally Kohn, the liberal commentator, summed up the left wing view fairly honestly when she told me in a recent debate over free speech that,  If [conservatives on campus] feel like they can no longer speak against positive social change, good. This is a paradigm where honest disagreement about abortion makes one a woman-hater, holding orthodox religious views on marriage equates to gay-bashing, and refusing to cop to white privilege   even if you are a working class white person struggling economically   defines you as a racist.A recent Slate article explaining why a slight majority of white women voted for Trump asserted that these female Trump supporters were  self-loathing  racists who were doing the bidding of their husbands and fathers. This is the omnipresent lefty trope Republican women have lived with for a long time, yet people are actually shocked that they wouldn t throw their support behind a party that too often casts them as gender-traitors.It s not hard to see how accusations against Trump as a racist and misogynist would be met with eye rolls and knowing murmurs of political correctness  by people who have had their worldview constantly caricatured and demonized by the cultural elites in academia, media and politics Continue this story at USA TodayREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"November 17, 2016"

23155,Five Things To Look Out For With Trump’s Pentagon,"21st Century Wire says Although he had some great ideas on the campaign trail, still expect the war hawks and Israeli Lobby instruments like John Bolton, Tom Cotton, and Rudy Giuliani to gradually nudge the new President and his administration, in a concerted attempt to try and reshape Trump s relatively common sense campaign foreign policy directives  Kristina Wong and Rebecca Kheel The HillDonald Trump s election was as much a surprise to the defense world as it was to much of the nation. Here are five key things the Pentagon can expect from Trump. 1. Rising spendingTrump has called for a much bigger military and some experts think he could increase defense spending by 20 percent, from $583 billion in 2017 to nearly $700 billion.While that may sound like a lot, it is in line with what the Obama administration projected for 2012 before the Pentagon was hit with sequestration   mandatory budget caps imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act.Trump has called for increasing the size of the active duty Army from 475,000 to 540,000 troops, and the Marine Corps from 24 to 36 battalions. He wants to build a 350-ship Navy, have 1,200 fighter aircraft in the Air Force and increase missile defense.Trump has pledged to lift limits on spending from the 2011 budget bill, something that would require action by Congress and could be difficult. The limits are in place until 2021.The Congress is controlled by the GOP, but not all Republicans are in favor of more military spending.Increasing defense spending could also increase the deficit, something Trump and the GOP are loathe to do. He separately wants to cut taxes, including for the wealthy, would could add to deficit concerns.2. Targeting ISISTrump has said he would  aggressively pursue  military operations to  crush and destroy  the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, but what that would entail is far from clear.By the time Trump takes office on Jan. 20, offensives to retake ISIS s strongholds in both countries will be underway, but the terrorist group is expected to continue waging an insurgency in both places even if they fall.Trump would likely seek cooperation with Russia in Syria to defeat ISIS, but it s not clear what that would mean. Russia began an air campaign there in September 2015, but has been hitting anti-regime rebels supported by the U.S., as well as civilians.Trump has also called for international cooperation to cut off ISIS s funding, expanding intelligence sharing, and cyberwarfare to disrupt its propaganda and recruiting. Trump has said he would also  decimate  Al Qaeda.3. Syria and AfghanistanNearly 500,000 people have been killed and 11 million displaced by the Syrian war, an intractable problem for President Obama.Trump has suggested that Syria President Bashar al-Assad is better than the  alternative,  which would be the coalition of anti-regime rebels that include U.S.-backed moderates as well as extremists. At the same time, Trump has said he would build safe zones in Syria, in order to stop the flow of refugees into Europe.Those two goals are somewhat contradictory, as Syria and Russia have a broad definition of  terrorists  and have been hitting those civilians the safe zones would protect. U.S. defense officials and experts say implementing safe zones would mean war with Syria, and possibly Russia.Trump s future policy in Afghanistan, where the U.S. has 9,800 troops, is also unclear.Before his bid for presidency, he had called for withdrawing troops, and criticized efforts to nation-build in the country. He reiterated that sentiment earlier this year, saying at a rally in August that he would end  the era of nation building. However, with the Taliban making a comeback, and al Qaeda and ISIS militants also trying to build safe havens, there will be pressure for Trump to maintain U.S. troops in Afghanistan.4. Closer ties with Russia?U.S. relations with Russia could improve under Trump.Trump has said he could meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin before he takes office in January, and repeatedly complimented him during the campaign.His statements on Russia s invasion of the Ukraine territory in Crimea and his refusal to blame Russia for cyber hacks against U.S. political institutions has unnerved people in both parties.It s possible Trump won t change policy toward Russia.Vice President-elect Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) took a much harder line against Russia during the campaign, suggesting during the vice presidential debate that the U.S. Could take military action against Russia in Syria.Trump will likely face staunch opposition to cozier relations from Congress from key Republicans such as Sen. John McCain (Ariz.).Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), whose name has been floated for secretary of State under Trump, has been highly critical of Russia s role in Syria.Some experts say although Trump may seek to actively engage Russia, cooperation would likely be based on what s mutually beneficial. He is a deal maker so he s going to want things in return for giving Russia what it is seeking,  said Paul Schwartz, defense analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Trump s win also puts the future of the 67-year-old NATO alliance in question at a time when lawmakers are working on bulking up the eastern flank to deter an increasingly aggressive Russia and finding ways to combat hybrid warfare, cyber attacks and terrorism.Trump called NATO obsolete multiple times over the course of the campaign, saying it should do more to fight terrorism. Trump also said he would look at whether NATO allies have  fulfilled their obligations to us  before deciding whether to defend them if they are attacked.Just five of 28 members meet the goal of spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense: the United States, the United Kingdom, Greece, Estonia and Poland.Michael O Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said there are a few paths Trump could take to fulfill his campaign promise.In one scenario, Trump could immediately pull out of commitments to defend countries that aren t meeting their 2 percent obligations.Trump could also make deals with such countries that give them a few years to meet the goal.5. Guantanamo staysWith President Obama unlikely to fulfill his pledge to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility by Jan. 20, Trump will inherit the facility and almost certainly keep it open Continue this story at The HillREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"November 16, 2016"
23156,Soros and Democrat Mega-Donors Meet to Plot Their War Against Donald Trump,"21st Century Wire says After investing hundreds of millions of dollars into the failed campaign of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, elite liberals and money men gathered in Washington, D.C., to plot a way bring down President-elect Donald Trump in his term in the White House.The conference, sponsored by the Democracy Alliance donor club, featured keynote presentations from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), and as well as social engineering mogul billionaire George Soros.The next war in being planend as we speak  Zero HedgeAccording to Politico, the meeting, which began on Sunday night at Washington s Mandarin Oriental hotel, is sponsored by the influential Democracy Alliance donor club and will include darlings of the left such as House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chairman Keith Ellison.Politico reports:The meeting is the first major gathering of the institutional left since Trump s shocking victory over Hillary Clinton in last week s presidential election, and, if the agenda is any indication, liberals plan full-on trench warfare against Trump from Day One. Some sessions deal with gearing up for 2017 and 2018 elections, while others focus on thwarting President-elect Trump s 100-day plan, which the agenda calls  a terrifying assault on President Obama s achievements   and our progressive vision for an equitable and just nation. Yet, the meeting also comes as many liberals are reassessing their approach to politics   and the role of the Democracy Alliance, or DA, as the club is known in Democratic finance circles. The DA, its donors and beneficiary groups over the last decade have had a major hand in shaping the institutions of the left, including by orienting some of its key organizations around Clinton, and by basing their strategy around the idea that minorities and women constituted a so-called  rising American electorate  that could tip elections to Democrats.The Democracy Alliance has fed upwards of $500 million toward liberal activist groups and candidates since Soros co-founded the group in 2005.All members of DA are required to give $200,000 a year to recommended activist groups and pay annual dues of $30,000 to fund the DA staff and its meetings.Gara LaMarche, the president of the DA, told donors Sunday evening that some reassessment is in order for the Democratic party.  You don t lose an election you were supposed to win, with so much at stake, without making some big mistakes, in assumptions, strategy and tactics,  LaMarche said, according to prepared remarks he provided to Politico.LaMarche would add that the reassessment  must take place without recrimination and finger-pointing, whatever frustration and anger some of us feel about our own allies in these efforts,  and he said  It is a process we should not rush, even as we gear up to resist the Trump administration. While focusing on preserving ObamaCare and other achievements of the Obama administration that are threatened by a Donald Trump presidency, the DA s agenda includes panels on rethinking polling and the left s approach to winning the working-class vote. The group will also stress funneling cash into state legislative policy initiatives and races where Republicans took over last week This article originally appeared at Zero HedgeREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"November 16, 2016"
23157,"CBS 60 Minutes Withheld Trump’s Appeal to ‘Stop Attacking Minorities,’ and Ignored Reports of Attacks on Trump Supporters","J.R. Smith 21st Century WireThe election campaign might be over, but the mainstream media s campaign against President Elect Donald Trump is in full swing. Between all of the fake polling, intentionally pro-Clinton partisan coverage, and mainstream media collusion with the Democratic National Party and the Clinton Campaign exposed through WikiLeaks  Podesta email dump   nearly the entire US mainstream media is now in full damage-limitation mode desperately trying to preserve any crumb of credibility and perceived authority they might have left.It s now become clear that the media is guilty on multiple fronts, as more proof has emerged of how they are helping to stoke violence, while promoting unfounded fears   and all the while pushing fictional  hate crime  hoaxes.CBS News flagship investigative program 60 Minutes conducted a recorded interview with  Trump on Friday in which he made a direct plea on camera to any possible supporters to  Stop it,  in reference to anyone that may have written racist slogans or abusive language in public, or at schools. In light of the numerous pockets of protests and outbreaks of partisan violence which have racked America since the election results were announced last week, it would have been in the public interest to release this powerful appeal by Trump, but instead mainstream CBS buried it for 3 days until 60 Minutes was scheduled to air later on Sunday evening nationwide. If CBS had any credibility remaining, this certainly will have finished it off.When told about alleged reports of a  Trump supporter  who were said to have been harassing Latinos and Muslims following his presidential win, Trump told interviewer Leslie Stahl,  I am so saddened to hear that.  He then added, And I say,  Stop it.  If it helps, I will say this   and I will say right to the cameras:  Stop it.' One big thing in this incident that many mainstream media observers did not pick up is that at no time did Stahl give any specifics on these alleged  abuses  by Trump supporters against Muslims and Latinos, and even though it s obvious that Trump was not responsible for directing any alleged abuses   Stahl still demanded an apology on their behalf   without offering any evidence to support her claim. This was  drive-by  media at its worst. In fact, not one of these said accusations of abuse have been properly investigated by the media, and some may end up actually being media-generated rumors, or even hoaxes.Now, it s perfectly understandable that Trump s victory over the establishment s heavily inflated candidate Hillary Clinton has left many Democrats, especially millennial college-aged students upset, angry and feeling more than a little delicate due to their bruised collective egos (they are not upset that Trump won, as much as they are upset that  they  lost). The real problem exists far beyond the learned immaturity of America s politically correct-obsessed young adults. The real danger is that Democratic Party gutter operatives and their liberal media cohorts are actually staging, and fabricating hate crime  incidents in order to propagate the idea that the President Elect and his supporters are somehow  causing many minorities fearful about the future .  In reality, much of this hype is being generated through these same liberal media outlets.In fact, one Muslim female from Louisiana has since been forced to apologize for inventing her alleged hate crime  incident   one designed to discredit Trump, and to help stoke more nationwide protests.Buzzfeed reported, via Religion of Peace:A woman who claimed she was attacked and robbed by two men near the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, including one wearing a Donald Trump hat, made up the story, police said in a statement.The woman had alleged the men yelled obscenities at her and took away her wallet and hijab, a scarf sometimes worn by Muslim women, The Advertiser reported.Lafayette Police officials said in a statement the incident is no longer under investigation, the paper reported. During the course of the investigation, the female complainant admitted that she fabricated the story about her physical attack as well as the removal of her hijab and wallet by two white males,  the statement reportedly read.NOTE: This story made national headlines and was not questioned or challenged by the hordes of self-described  journalists  who populate the news and editorial newsrooms of America s corrupt liberal mainstream media.That s right   this was just another hoax:Violent Democratic-Affiliated Street GangsWhat Leslie Stahl and the rest of the gatekeepers at CBS and 60 Minutes have obscured is the fact since Tuesday s election, nearly all of the so-called  violent hate crimes  have been carried out against Trump supporters   by street gangs who are most clearly Democrat Party supporters.Here are just a few examples:@michellemalkin Even high school kids are not spared. Student Trump supporter attacked at Woodside High School https://t.co/e7tVvDJ6O8  Mama Angel (@Mommysaurus75) November 11, 2016Watch this clip taken from the radical leftist Portland protests this weekend, where Democratic Party supports attack a single woman in her car because they believed that she was a  Trump supporter.  These violent incidents reveal the flavor of anarchy which the Democratic Party and the sitting President of the United States, Barack Obama   are condoning through their deaf silence over the multiple reports of street violence unleashed with the help of the Democratic Party s online  community organizer  network MoveOn.org   a digital platform partly funded by leading Clinton donor and billionaire George Soros. Watch this stunning clip: From reports we learned that at no time before the attack took place did Wilcox display any support for Donald Trump. It appears as if they attacked him because he was white. So could one call this a case of black on white racism? Regardless, it s political intimidation done on the street   which could also be defined as pure political fascism. In this instance, the violence was partisan, and carried out by what could be classed as unofficial Democrat foot soldiers   enforcing a type of radical political regime on the streets of America. Watch this disturbing video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7zEibNcejA . Agitator and Chief: Where is Obama?These incidents have been mostly blacked out by a national US media who are obviously still working to discredit the Trump Presidency.Amidst all this violence, however, where is the current President Obama, or the Democratic Party s losing candidate Hillary Clinton   to help calm street thugs and violent  progressives ? It s almost as if Obama and Clinton are enjoying the unrest. Most certainly though, Obama, Clinton and the Democratic Party are hoping to use this week s media-generated liberal angst as future political leverage.What used to be regarded as a reputable investigative news program, 60 minutes, has gradually become a joke. It seems disinterested in covering anything of genuine interest, opting instead for running bland People Magazine and Time Magazine-style  safe  segments. Judging by its plummeting ratings, and its predictable cast of  job for life  government-approved media gatekeeper-cum-commentators like Anderson Cooper and Lesley Stahl, there is little hope for this institution. You might even say it s irredeemable.One of the corporate mainstream s worst offenders during the election was CNN host Brian Stelter (photo, left), whose own show is ironically titled  Reliable Sources.  Stelter is meant to be CNN s media watchdog person, laughably given the lofty title as  senior media analyst.  After leading CNN s own exposed efforts to obscure and derail Trump s Presidential run, while working to cover for a hugely unpopular (even among Democrats) Hillary Clinton candidacy, Stelter has now taken it upon himself to revamp his network s horrible reputation as an establishment gatekeeper and manipulator of US elections. But it s too late. The damage has already been done, and CNN will not regain the hanging facade of credibility it once struggled to retain. They are a dirty media outlet, and now everyone knows it.Now CBS News has been exposed in public view, but their crime is even worse than CNN s which was just dirty politics in comparison. CBS News took it upon itself to compromise public safety, and put lives at risk   all for its own selfish institutional political position. Twenty years ago, this might have been considered shameful, but in today s toxic liberal media establishment ruled by an unhealthy feeling of superiority over the unwashed masses   they are all way past shameless at this stage.None of them can be trusted anymore   only tolerated, in the hope that they might actually report some useful news in the coming years.More on the CBS 60 Minutes scandal from The Hill  COSMETIC: CBS s Stahl represents the shallow, bland irrelevance of the mainstream gatekeeping media. Joe Concha The HillCBS News is under fire for holding a videotaped clip from a Friday interview with President-elect Donald Trump urging supporters not to attack minorities until a  60 Minutes  broadcast on Sunday night. I am very surprised to hear that. I hate to hear it,  Trump told interviewer Lesley Stahl when told of some attacks on minorities that have reportedly occurred since his election victory Tuesday. I am so sorry to hear it, and I say stop it,  Trump said before looking directly into the camera.  And I say right to the camera, stop it. 60 Minutes  did release quotes from the Friday interview in advance, but only a statement by Trump on the Affordable Care Act. We chose to release a quote on the issue that affects the most Americans & that was his statement on Obamacare,  a spokesperson for CBS told CNN Monday.Kai Ryssdal, host of  Marketplace,  called that reasoning  completely underwhelming. CBS's underwhelming answer: ""We chose to release a quote on the issue that affects the most Americans & that was his statement on Obamacare""  Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) November 14, 2016Protests have grown in the wake of Trump s victory in major cities across the country.Not all protests have been peaceful. A protester was shot in Portland last Thursday and hospitalized. Hundreds of arrests have been made, property has been damaged and traffic has snarled due to roads being blocked by protesters chanting  Impeach Trump  and  Not my president.

23158,Amerika: ‘Tolerant’ University Educators Exile Trump Voters from American Campuses,"21st Century Wire says Since the late 1960 s, it s become accepted as a fact of political life that the faculty and administrations of America s universities have a heavily ingrained liberal bias, but to see them now actively working to cleanse their campuses of any pro-Trump and conservative voices demonstrates that their  progressive values  have progressed far beyond what used to be considered as liberal  and into the realm of political fascism and Marxist-style identity politics. The liberal reaction to the US Election result not only marks a low ebb of American culture, but it also proves beyond any doubt that the US university system is failing to teach life s basics Last week s US Presidential Election result has accentuated this phenomenon, bringing many hardcore radical campus political ideologies out of their academic shells, and into the open, in all of their ugliness. Some university heads around the country have called for  safe spaces  on their campuses   where traumatized Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders student supporters can go to retreat from any mention of Donald Trump, and to protect them from hearing any speech in support of President Elect Trump. Quite rightly, because of frequent incidents like this, many are now viewing American academia as one giant institutionalized brainwashing mill   where political correctness is not only encouraged, it s also being legislated.RELATED: DePaul University Threatens to ARREST Conservative editor Ben Shapiro if He Stepped on CampusThis is the danger of a liberal America which appears to desire not only a single party state, but also a sanitized monoculture where speech and expression are heavily regulated   and also self-policed by  progressive mobs. This leftist culture of extreme intolerance to any opposing views   where students will demand protection  from the state and administrative bodies from even hearing any opposing opinions in public   is heading dangerously close to Mao s Amerika  Glenn Reynolds USA TodayOne of the more amusing bits of fallout from last week s election has been the safe-space response of many colleges and universities to the election of the  wrong  candidate. But on closer examination, this response isn t really amusing. In fact, it s downright mean.Donald Trump s substantial victory, when most progressives expected a Hillary Clinton landslide, came as a shock to many. That shock seems to have been multiplied in academia, where few people seem to know any Trump supporters   or, at least, any Trump supporters who ll admit to it.The response to the shock has been to turn campuses into kindergarten. The University of Michigan Law School announced a  post-election self-care  event with  food  and  play,  including  coloring sheets, play dough (sic), positive card-making, Legos and bubbles with your fellow law students.  (Embarrassed by the attention, UM Law scrubbed the announcement from its website, perhaps concerned that people would wonder whether its graduates would require Legos and bubbles in the event of stressful litigation.) IN NEED OF  SAFE SPACES : Hillary Clinton supporters struggling to cope with the reality of democracy (Image Source: Fellowship of the Minds)Stanford emailed its students and faculty that psychological counseling was available for those experiencing  uncertainty, anger, anxiety and/or fear  following the election. So did the University of Michigan s Flint campus.Meanwhile, even the Ivy League wasn t immune, with the University of Pennsylvania (Trump s alma mater) creating a post-election safe space with puppies and coloring books:Student Daniel Tancredi reported that the people who attended were  fearful  about the results of the election. For the most part, students just hung out and ate snacks and made small talk,  Tancredi told  The College Fix.   Of course, that was in addition to coloring and playing with the animals. Yale had a  group scream. At Tufts, the university offered arts and crafts, while the University of Kansas reminded students that there were plenty of  therapy dogs  available.  At other schools, exams were canceled and professors expressed their sympathy to traumatized students.It s easy to mock this as juvenile silliness   because, well, it is juvenile silliness of the sort documented in Frank Furedi s What s Happened To The University? But that s not all it is. It s also exactly what these schools purport to abhor:  an effort to marginalize and silence part of the university community.In an email to students, University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel wrote: Our responsibility is to remain committed to education, discovery and intellectual honesty   and to diversity, equity and inclusion. We are at our best when we come together to engage respectfully across our ideological differences; to support all who feel marginalized, threatened or unwelcome; and to pursue knowledge and understanding. But when you treat an election in which the  wrong  candidate wins as a traumatic event on a par with the 9/11 attacks, calling for counseling and safe spaces, you re implicitly saying that everyone who supported that  wrong  candidate is, well, unsafe. Despite the talk about diversity and inclusion, this is really sending the signal that people who supported Trump   and Trump is leading the state of Michigan, so there are probably quite a few on campus   aren t really included in acceptable campus culture. It s not promoting diversity; it s enforcing uniformity. It s not promoting inclusion; it s practicing exclusion Continue this story at USA TodayREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE NOW & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"November 15, 2016"

23160,"Finally, Obama Speaks: Americans Need to ‘Reconcile Themselves’ with a Trump Presidency","21st Century Wire says There is an amazing scene unfolding in America  While the Democratic Party s  community organizing  machine helps ignite street protests, and even some violence, on streets nationwide   the Democratic President goes in front of the press this morning saying,  Look, the people have spoken. Donald Trump will be the next president. After a week of concentrated unrest, the President has been totally silent about street protests rejecting the election result   almost as a wink and a knod, quietly encouraging, or perhaps tempting a boiling point. When will President directly engage the American people on this issue?Certainly, if this situation were reversed, the media would be demanding that a Republican president go to the American people calling for calm   and to accept the American media s newly invented term,  the peaceful transition of power. More  leading from behind  in Washington  Gregory Korte USA TodayPresident Obama is answering questions about the election, the presidential transition and his legacy Monday at a White House news conference  his first since voters handed the White House over to a candidate who promised to dismantle his agenda.Appearing relaxed and reflective, Obama said Americans had to  reconcile themselves  to the Trump presidency, but that he was optimistic about the country and his Democratic party.He also made clear that he has things he wants to accomplish before he leaves office.  We re going to make sure that we finish what we started, that we don t let up in these last two months,  he said.Obama said his White House team should be proud of what they ve accomplished.  We ve already ensured that when we turn over the keys, the car is in pretty good shape. We are indisputably in a better position now than we were when I came in eight years ago. ( ) At the Monday news conference, Obama addressed:  The outcome of the election:  Look, the people have spoken. Donald Trump will be the next president, the 45th president of the United States. Those who didn t vote for him have to understand, that s how the system works. That s how democracy operates,  he said.  Whenever you have an incoming president on the other side, particularly after a contentious election like we ve had, it takes a while for people to reconcile themselves to that new reality. Hopefully it s a reminder that elections matter.  His Oval Office meeting with Trump: Probably the most important point that I made was that how you staff, particularly the chief of staff, the national security adviser, the White House counsel   that s something that has to be attended to right away,  he said.  I think it s important to give him the room and the space to do that. Obama said he told Trump he was encouraged by his more conciliatory tone since the election.  Gestures matter, and how he reaches out to groups that may not have supported him   those are the kinds of things that can set the tone to move forward once he takes office.  The future of the Democratic party:  It s a healthy thing for the Democratic party to go through some reflection. I think it s important for me not to be bigfooting that conversation.

23163,Henningsen: ‘US Anti-Trump Protests Similar to Soros Color Revolutions Abroad’,"21st Century Wire says Organized efforts are underway by Democratic Party affiliated NGO s to try and somehow delegitimize the results of this week s US Presidential Election. On the eve of the US Election before voters went to the polls, 21WIRE political affairs analyst Patrick Henningsen accurately predicted this week s unrest when he said: If Trump wins, expect the likes of Soros and MoveOn.org to unleash wave after wave of flash mobs, who will protest, riot, smash and burn their way on to CNN s 24 hour news rotation.

Watch: SEE ALSO: (VIDEO) Female College Students Protesting Because  Trump is a Rapist 21WIRE Associate Editor Shawn Helton recently revealed more details about how the near exact same methods used in CIA and Soros-funded  color revolutions  overseas   are now being deployed on US domestic shores by similar NGO front organizations:  has been the driving force behind nationwide protests against the election of Donald Trump. Overseas, Washington tends to use the same cast of NGO fronts to build-up pro-US political opposition groups, as well as plan and generate civil unrest. They include the Albert Einstein Institute (AEI), National Endowment for Democracy (NED), International Republican Institute (IRI), National Democratic Institute (NDI), Freedom House and later the International Center for Non-Violent Conflict (ICNC), and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the financial and contractor arm of the Department of State. Inside the US, deep state actors in Washington generally work through Democratic Party affiliated organizations like MoveOn.org, as well as through labor union organizations like AFL-CIO, and UNITE HERE. These, along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this week s protests,  says Helton. Helton also raised the question as to why President Obama has stayed silent in the face of street protests, opting instead to  lead from behind.  He explains: Certainly, judging by President Obama and Hillary Clinton s total silence over their own party s role in fomenting this week s unrest   one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots. The political motivation is undeniable   to help delegitimize a new Trump presidency.

23165,‘COLOR REV’ AGIT PROP: George Soros MoveOn Agitators March on America – as Billionaire Instigator Sued,"Shawn Helton 21st Century WireAnti-Trump street protests linked to the Soros  funded organization MoveOn.org have cascaded across the nation for the third day following the 2016 presidential election result.Mainstream media outlets like CNN and MSNBC have given the protests around-the-clock media coverage, drowning out all other news stories, including a successful transition meeting between the President Elect and President Barack Obama.  OUTSIDER VS. INSIDER    Manufactured social unrest incited after announcement of Trump presidency. (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)The Free Thought Project weighed in on the new developments concerning a series of centrally coordinated anti-Trump protests organized in part by by the George Soros NGO MoveOn: Washington, D.C.   Billionaire globalist financier George Soros  MoveOn.org has been revealed to be a driving force behind the organizing of nationwide protests against the election of Donald Trump   exposing the protests to largely be an organized, top-down operation   and not an organic movement of concerned Americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media.Wednesday saw protests in the streets of at least 10 major U.S. cities. Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, Washington, D.C., Portland, Ore., St. Paul, Minn., Seattle, and several other cities saw protests, according to USA Today.In light of the protests and rioting that have transpired since the election of Trump, a closer analysis of the dynamic at play is warranted to gauge whether it s an organic grassroots movement, or something much more organized, sophisticated and potentially dangerous. Soros  affiliated organization MoveOn.org released the following press release yesterday afternoon: Americans to Come Together in Hundreds Peaceful Gatherings of Solidarity, Resistance, and Resolve Following Election ResultsHundreds of Americans, dozens of organizations to gather peacefully outside the White House and in cities and towns nationwide to take a continued stand against misogyny, racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia.Tonight, thousands of Americans will come together at hundreds of peaceful gatherings in cities and towns across the nation, including outside the White House, following the results of Tuesday s presidential election.The gatherings   organized by MoveOn.org and allies   will affirm a continued rejection of Donald Trump s bigotry, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and misogyny and demonstrate our resolve to fight together for the America we still believe is possible.Within two hours of the call-to-action, MoveOn members had created more than 200 gatherings nationwide, with the number continuing to grow on Wednesday afternoon. Soros Agit-Prop EmpireLast year during the ongoing European migrant crisis, startling claims were levied by Hungarian PM Victor Orban (left photo), concerning the role played by Soros.PM Orban contended that the founder and chair of Open Society Foundations (Open Society Institute), was entrenched in a  circle of activists,  that inadvertently become part of this international human-smuggling network. The stunning declaration by Orban recalled the misguided machinations of The Occupy Movement (aka OWS) in 2011, as well as the Soros funded protests in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, along with other Black Lives Matter protests this past year   all of which were uniquely designed to push naive participants (along with paid provocateurs) into violent action and social unrest.Back in January, MoveOn publicly endorsed the Bernie Sanders campaign in what appeared to be a call to action for BLM associated groups seen backing Sanders. It s worth mentioning, that MoveOn also supported the Obama campaign in 2008 and according to the website, Sanders was the only other candidate to reach the threshold for an endorsement. As we said back in March, professional political agitator flash mobs, had been mobilized at future Trump campaign events, making it very difficult to run a normal campaign   as  activists  attempted to take away Trump s  strength in numbers  at his rallies. This was confirmed at events in both Ohio, and at a Trump primary campaign event the University of Illinois Chicago earlier this year, where hundreds of BLM activists and Sanders supporters triggered voilent clashes inside the venue and even stormed the stage, shortly after Trump started speaking. Then again at Reno, just prior to the election, Trump was birddogged, forcing secret service to escort the Republican nominee away to safety.In a Politico article in early 2016 entitled  Major donors consider funding Black Lives Matter,  we gain deeper insight into the political funding for BLM and the Soros linked Democratic Alliance: Major donors are usually not as radical or confrontational as activists most in touch with the pain of oppression,  said Steve Phillips, a Democracy Alliance member and significant contributor to Democratic candidates and causes. He donated to a St. Louis nonprofit group called the Organization for Black Struggle that helped organize 2014 Black Lives Matter-related protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the police killing of a black teenager named Michael Brown. And Phillips and his wife, Democracy Alliance board member Susan Sandler, are in discussions about funding other groups involved in the movement. It worth noting how Soros, a long time contributor to Hillary Clinton, donated $2 million in PAC money in 2015 and January of 2016, Soros reportedly gave $8 million to  boost  Clinton s campaign. Soros also recently funded $15 million to Latino groups looking to stop Trump s rise towards a potential GOP nomination and beyond.Look for these political engineers to pit choreographed conservative and liberal groups against each other across the country   as all of these hostile uprisings are designer engineered by party linked alliances.  SOCIAL ENGINEERING    Political memes and staged political flash mobs have been sparked by media, NGO s and social media.

PAID PROTEST?    Social justice warriors incite anti-Trump violence across the US. (Image Source: youtube)USA Color RevolutionsBoth the purpose of these types of agitation activities seems to be to first cause a public disruption, and also to foment are a form of modern class warfare. These political protests  are designed in such a way as to disguise its true intentions. Ultimately, a radical globalist and cultural marxist  progressive  agenda is at play   eroding the legitimacy of a democratically elected government through a series of artificial  color  upheavals, and where possible   weakening a country s national sovereignty through forced dependency on multilateral globalist institutions like the UN or IMF, while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the public s political perspective.This is how the US and its CIA conduct their destablization  color revolution  campaigns overseas, and now astute observers will be able to see these exact same methods being deployed here inside the US.Overseas, Washington tends to use the same cast of NGO fronts to build-up pro-US political opposition groups, as well as plan and generate civil unrest. They include the Albert Einstein Institute (AEI), National Endowment for Democracy (NED), International Republican Institute (IRI), National Democratic Institute (NDI), Freedom House and later the International Center for Non-Violent Conflict (ICNC), and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the financial and contractor arm of the Department of State.Inside the US, deep state actors in Washington generally work through Democratic Party affiliated organizations like MoveOn.org, as well as through labor union organizations like AFL-CIO, and UNITE HERE. These, along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this week s protests.It still remains to be seen if Trump s stated dynamic political vision for America can unite an embattled nation by restoring international relations throughout the world, in addition to helping economic woes at home, or will it simply push the country further into authoritarianism. This remains to be seen.Certainly, judging by President Obama and Hillary Clinton s total silence over their own party s role in fomenting this week s unrest   one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots. The political motivation is undeniable   to help delegitimize a new Trump presidency.But one thing is for sure   there s no doubt now that a systematic design is in place to unsettle the 45th president and the public should question why.Legal Action Against Soros GroupsIn a recent report featured at RT news we learn that George Soros and BLM activists will be sued for the deaths of slain police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge:The father of Patrick Zamarripa filed a lawsuit against Black Lives Matter and other groups for allegedly  inciting a war on police  that led to the death of his son.The lawsuit filed in US District Court in Dallas on Monday seeks $550 million in damages. While Defendant Black Lives Matter claims to combat anti-black racism,  the lawsuit said, according to the Fort Worth Star Telegram,  the movement has in fact incited and committed further violence, severe bodily injury and death against police officers of all races and ethnicities, Jews, and Caucasians. Defendant Black Lives Matter is in fact a violent and revolutionary criminal gang. The misguided machinations behind the anti-Trump protests have dominated any peaceful transition into power for the president-elect.

23166,REVEALED: List of People President Elect Trump is Considering for Top White House Postions,"21st Century Wire says IMPORTANT: We are particularly worried about John Bolton and Rudolph Giuliani holding major diplomatic positions   they are both damaged goods and relics of a failed Neoconservative past which some Republicans are acting nostalgic about. Both Bolton and Giuliani have pressed for a pre-emptive strike on Iran in the past, and with continued pressure and finance from the Israeli Lobby   it s a near certainty that they will continue this foreign policy line. Trump won the GOP primaries by rejecting the Bush docrine and the Neocon model of foreign intervention. If Trump reverses that postion he is only creating a new and more powerful anti-war oppostion in America. A hawkish Trump policy would only galvanize the left in America, and globally.Let s see if he s smart enough to realize this prospective reality and appoint his cabinet accordingly  TRANSITION: Media currently carried away with speculation over what a  President Trump  administration will look like in Janruary. Daily CallerDonald Trump is contemplating naming a number of recognizable players from the 2016 campaign to serve in senior White House roles, according to an internal transition document obtained exclusively by The Daily Caller.The list was provided by a member of the transition team on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press. Described as a  working  document, it is being used to help the president-elect envision a White House staff structure, the source said. Some people are listed more than once.It includes names like Trump campaign chairman Stephen K. Bannon, RNC chairman Reince Priebus, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn.Bannon   who was executive chairman of Breitbart News before joining the Trump campaign   is under consideration for chief of staff, as is Priebus. The choice here could be telling about Trump s strategy for working with Congress: Bannon, who is proudly anti-establishment, detests House Speaker Paul Ryan while Priebus and Ryan are close allies.Like chief of staff, a number of the roles listed seem to include both insider and outsider options. For example, Kellyanne Conway, a longtime Republican pollster, is in contention with Corey Lewandowski, who worked with the New Hampshire state police until 2010, for the position of senior adviser.Lewandowski is also in consideration for the role of deputy chief of staff for planning, as is Katie Walsh, the RNC s chief of staff. As for White House counsel, the list includes both Alan Garten, the general counsel at the Trump Organization, and Donald McGahn, his campaign attorney, as options.Trump policy adviser Stephen Miller   an immigration hawk and former communications aide to Alabama GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions   is under consideration for a variety roles, including deputy chief of staff for policy, director of speechwriting, director of the domestic policy council and director of communications. Miller often warmed up for Trump during rallies in the Republican primary and embodies Trump s message of limited immigration, free trade skepticism and distaste for the donor class.Miller isn t the only former Sessions aide being considered for a Trump administration. Rick Dearborn, Sen. Sessions  chief of staff, is listed as the sole option for leading the office of legislative affairs.Like Sessions, former GOP Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, formerly the chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, appears likely to have influence in the Trump administration. He is being considered for both national security advisor and assistant to the president for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism. His former chief of staff, Andy Keiser, is also being considered for the position of deputy national security advisor.Two other people listed for national security advisor are retired Army Lt. Gen. Micheal Flynn, who served as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama, and Stephen Hadley, who served in the same role under former President George W. Bush. Flynn, Rogers, and Hadley are all hawkish. Flynn has called for the destruction of the Syrian city of Raqqa, Hadley served as deputy national security adviser during the invasion of Iraq and Rogers said in 2014 that ground troops should be deployed to fight the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.As for White House press secretary, the list includes some memorable faces from the campaign: former Ted Cruz aide and eventual Trump spokesman Jason Miller, top RNC aide Sean Spicer and Conway.Here is the list obtained by TheDC:Assistant to the President and Chief of StaffStephen K. Bannon, Reince PriebusAssistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism.Keith Kellogg, Mike RogersAssistant to the President and Press Secretary.Jason Miller, Sean Spicer, Kellyanne ConwayAssistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Planning.

The facts simply do not support the myth.  Defense OneThe Obama administration has approved more than $278 billion in foreign arms sales in its eight years, more than double the total of the previous administration, according to figures released by the Pentagon on Tuesday.Many of the approved deals   most but hardly all of which have become actual sales   have been to Mideast nations, including key allies in the campaign against Islamic State militants and countries that have been building up their defenses in fear of a nuclear Iran.Saudi Arabia has been the largest recipient, reaping prospective deals worth more than $115 billion, according to notices announcing the deals that were sent to Congress for approval. Nobody even comes close  for the number of deals and total value, said William Hartung, director of the Arms Security Project at the Center for International Policy.

Various protests and riots have been organized around a number university campuses including Berkeley, Portland, New York City and Los Angleses. When asked why she scared by the election result, one female university student claimed that the President Elect is a  rapist,  while another claim that,  He [Trump] is about to have a court case about a 13 years old girl soon, and I m not down for that. The alleged court case the student is referring was actually dropped, and has since been exposed as a likely politically motivated hoax according to reports.Here is last night s student protest, including multiple interviews from both sides of the debate, filmed last night in  Albuquerque, New Mexico, by Stuart J Hooper.

According to Bloomberg financial analysts, Slim, Mexico s wealthiest person and rated fifth on the global rich list, took a stinging $5.1 billion haircut after the Mexican Peso went into a 12% free fall after Trump s stunning upset over Democratic Hillary Clinton.Slim s loss amounted to a staggering 9.2 percent of his total fortune.In the week before, polls showed Hillary Clinton as the odds on favorite, netting the billionaires a staggering $57 billion in total wealth increase across world markets.

23174,STUNNER: Donald Trump is Next President of United States,"21st Century Wire says Republican candidate Donald J Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.History has been made, as he will be the first person ever to hold office despite having no previous political or military experience  Trump s victory was definitive. By breaking through the seemingly impregnable  Blue Wall  in the northern rust belt of Wisconsin and Michigan, Trump effectively ran the table on Democrat favorite Hillary Clinton in what pundits are calling one of the biggest political realignments in decades. It s time for America to bind the wounds of division,  said Trump in front on a crowd of thousands at his acceptance speech at the Hilton in downtown Manhattan.Trump s victory over Clinton is now regarded as the most stunning upset in US political history   upending the establishment s false polling and the mainstream media s collusion with the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign.  Neither the polls or the pundits saw this coming.It s reported that Hillary Clinton called Trump to concede the race before he addressed his supporters. I ve just received a call from Secretary Clinton,  said Trump.  She congratulated us, it s about us, on our victory. And I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a very long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. And I mean that very sincerely. Earlier this week, Trump predicted his victory, likening it to the UK s surprise BREXIT vote this past summer, saying it would be  Brexit Plus Plus. After being written off by the media and the party establishment in the GOP primaries, and then again in the general election, Trump still managed to capture the imagination of one of the biggest insurgent voting blocks in electoral history. Before the results came in, yesterday 21WIRE editor Patrick Henningsen commented on the key to Trump s success, explaining: Granted, half of the American population have been conditioned to hate Trump for various reasons. But many of them are missing the key point in the Trump story, just like they did in the Sanders story. Trump offered millions of voters something profound: the idea that even in today s insulated political fortress that is Washington DC, anything is still possible in American politics   where an outsider can come in and shake up a stale and corrupt ruling class.

The barrage of celebrity Clinton campaigners threatening to leave the US helped to propel this talking point nationwide and seems to fall neatly into line with the Clinton campaign s negative fear-based campaign strategy.According to online searches, the Canadian site went down just after 10:30 pm ET on Tuesday evening followed by a surge in traffic, presumably for information on emigrating north of the border.Other key states have shocked pollsters and media  experts  in this election including strong Trump performances in Michigan, Ohio, Florida, North Carolina and Arizona.Stay up to date with all the results on the Business Insider live-blog here SEE ALSO: How to move to Canada and become a Canadian citizenREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"November 9, 2016"

The feudal theocratic dictatorship who is funding and supporting ISIS and al Qaeda terrorists groups groups globally   has chosen their candidate  According to one WikiLeaks email, Clinton herself discussed how Gulf monarchies Saudi Arabia and Qatar are  providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [Islamic State, IS, ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups. While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region,  Clinton wrote. This effort will be enhanced by the stepped up commitment in the [Kurdish Regional Government]. The Qataris and Saudis will be put in a position of balancing policy between their ongoing competition to dominate the Sunni world and the consequences of serious U.S. pressure. So the Clinton Foundation has been knowingly accepting millions of dollars in donations from the very same Gulf states that both Secretary Clinton and President Obama knew were funding ISIS, Al Nusra Front (al Qaeda in Syria) and many other known takfiri terrorist fighting organizations currently infesting Syria and Iraq.No wonder Clinton plays so well with Saudi Arabia Al Arabiya An opinion poll by the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies in Washington and that included nine Arab countries revealed that 68 percent of the Saudis prefer that Hillary Clinton wins the presidential elections while 46 percent thought Donald Trump was bad.The nine countries included Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Kuwait, Morocco, Jordan, Palestine (the West Bank and the Gaza Strip), Saudi Arabia and Tunisia and an average of 400 people from each country participated in the questionnaire.Asked which of the candidates will positively influence the US policy towards the Arab region, 65 percent of the Saudis said Clinton s victory will positively impact the Arab region.The Arab public opinion prefers Clinton s win by 66 percent while 11 percent prefer Trump s victory. The highest percentage in support of Clinton winning the presidency was in Morocco and Tunisia while the least percentage in favor of Clinton s victory was in Palestine and Iraq.

23178,Trump vs Clinton 2016: Mickey Mouse vs Cruella de Vil," Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireToday America will choose its next president. What can you say that hasn t already been said in this, the most over-analyzed political contest in history?No matter which side of this salacious Vaudeville ticket you are on, everyone will agree this has been the most raucous and divisive contest in electoral history. No matter who wins today, half the nation will be in pain, not least of all the Founding Fathers who have been rolling in their graves for the last 18 months.More than ever, America is a nation divided. An increasing number of people are now completely immersed in hyper-active social media environments, and so it s very easy to get caught up in one s respective partisan echo chambers;  our way is the best way,   our side is right,   the other side is bad for America,   we are the true party of the people  etc.  Many individuals simply will not  venture off of their assigned party or pseudo-ideological reservations, much less talk to anyone whose views seem to oppose theirs. In public, partisan Americans will only huddle with those who share the same team colors, and in private each flees to his or her prefabricated partisan media outlet or social  networking group. This virtual political matrix is now systematically divided in this way. There is nothing in between:  no middle ground, no real commons, and no respite from the onslaught of partisan media. Herein lies the fundamental problem in 2016 politics   and why the fall-out from this election will be ongoing long after the results are announced tomorrow morning.To make matters even worse, this election season has featured two highly flawed candidates in Donald J Trump and Hillary Clinton. Many commentators contend that these are the two worst US presidential candidates ever. Essentially it boils down to Mickey Mouse vs Cruella de Vil.Let s quickly profile the two candidates:Since the 1990 s the Clintons have been synonymous with one word: scandal. The 90 s was a dodgy decade for the First Family: Bill, Monica, Whitewater, the Arkancide epidemic, and selling White House s Lincoln Bedroom for 50 grand a night. Take your pick. None of this has helped Hillary in terms of public trust, where she s polling even lower than Donald Trump. On top of all the old Clinton baggage, you have two huge new scandals originating from her tenure as Obama s Secretary of State   including becoming the latest member of her family to lie under oath to Congress (way to go Bill), this time over Hillary s private email server cover-up, and multiple pay-to-play corruption allegations at the Clinton Foundation.As result, Hillary Clinton embodies the avatar of Cruella de Vil  Her campaign breaks down like this: Fighting for Woman and Children If you support Hillary Clinton then you believe your candidate represents the ascendency of the female species, and especially all women who have been held back by the cruel customs of an American patriarchal society. You also recognize her brand: Clinton. She s the wife of the 42nd President of the United States, Bill Clinton, which leads you directly into the second half of the campaign pitch:  She has the experience, having been around the White House for 8 years. Since the beginning of her first campaign in 2008, Clinton the woman was the main identifier and the primary reason why she should be president. Instead it was  the first black President,  so she had to wait 8 years. At the age of 69, she s past her prime, but she d still be the first woman president and therefore, we re told,  an inspiration to women everywhere  as the marketing slogan says. She is also the champion of all minorities, as well as the poor   which are also traditional Democratic Party staples, although the  poor point is hard to square, seeing that the Clinton s have amassed a net worth in the hundreds of millions in the short space of 15 years   primarily by monetizing their time in public office through enormous speaking fees and scraping off expenses and lifestyle extras from their billion dollar Foundation slush fund (a whole other scandal). Regardless, her supporters see her as their champion, rallying around a familiar set of leftwing social issues: inequality/redistribution of wealth, pro-choice/abortion, amnesty for undocumented/illegal immigrants, and man-made global warming/climate change.The novelty of Trump is like no other before him. At first, it could be explained like this: for some strange reason, it s a tradition in America that a certain number of people each year will cast a write-in vote for Mickey Mouse on their ballot. This is regarded as the ultimate protest vote   a vote for Mickey is a vote against the establishment. So it should be no surprise that when he arrived on the electoral scene in June 2015, his support base was already waiting for him   Trump was their 70 year old, 6 foot 3 inch, 236 lbs Mickey Mouse Trump s campaign breaks down like this: Make America Great Again If you support Trump, then you believe this is the story of a true underdog, the consummate outsider taking on the political elites   a man with absolutely no experience in political office (other than writing cheques for nearly all them), uncorrupted by corporate money (because he has his own) and shunned by the self-serving political and media establishment who have done nothing for the country s working class and rapidly disappearing middle class. While some of this is true, as a reality TV icon, a billionaire property magnate and career playboy, Trump is certainly no  man of the people  in the Horatio Alger sense. Despite all that, judging by most major polls, nearly half of the United States population is behind him. To them, he is their champion. He ll lower taxes and bring back the jobs from overseas, rebuild the military, and most importantly, he doesn t want any money from corporate lobbyists. When crowds chant,  Drain the swamp!  referring to Washington DC, he s the man they want to hire to do that job. Trump s response to them is simple:  I only work for one special interest group, and that s you the American people.  In this sense, Trump has run the most unconventional political campaign ever.Love him or loath him, that message resonates and for good reason. The door to the cess pit is now open and many are horrified at what they see. Through the incredible WikiLeaks Podesta Email trove, many Americans have been able to peek inside the rude, incestuous and outright nasty elite political scene that controls Washington DC. Clinton was hit pretty hard by the WikiLeaks revelations, as was the already shaky credibility of the Clinton Foundation. This exposed a lot of the corruption around her and the party. Also, ten days before the election FBI Director James Comey through a grenade into the Clinton juggernaut by announcing the FBI would reopen Hillary s email case because of data discovered through her chief aid Huma Abedin s estranged sex-pest husband Anthony Weiner. This put a timely dent into Clinton s lead. With the help of the US media though, she battled though it and emerged from that m l e.Although he faced much less in terms of real institutional corruption scandals, Trump did not fair as well in public relations terms as Clinton did. Part of the reason for this was that Trump and the establishment media are like chalk and cheese. He s too unconventional for the bland gatekeepers. One of the reasons media operatives hated Trump was because he could generate his own gravity, and this posed a direct challenge to state-oriented propaganda machines like CNN who are busy spoon-feeding their own artificial version of reality to the American people. So, after a brief primary honeymoon, the media (aside from FOX News) declared all-out war on Trump. With each passing week, he was hamstrung by an endless string of media traps, Twitter gaffes and internal campaign tedium. Dogged by the media and his opponents, Trump couldn t hold his tongue or stay off of Twitter, and so his retaliatory tirades turned into negative headlines. For intelligent pundits and moderate supporters, the constant gaffes and distractions made it almost impossible to consider Donald Trump as a serious candidate. To the casual observer, it would appear that The Donald was nothing but a stalking horse for Hillary.The same could be said for Democratic primary challenger Bernie Sanders (photo, left). Up until the moment he entered the contest in July 2015, party favorite Hillary Clinton was essentially running unopposed. It s almost as if Sanders was drafted into the race at the last minute in order to make it look like a real race, and then at an opportune moment   he would pledge his allegiance to the party favorite. That s exactly how it played out. Early on Sanders  chances were practically DOA because of the Democratic Party s pre-rigged  Super Delegate  system. Still, he fought on and pulled bigger crowds than Hillary. Then the real bomb dropped when it was revealed through the Democratic National Committee (DNC) email leaks how party chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Shultz along with party elites, conspired to railroad the Bernie Sanders campaign. That s right, Bernie was shot down by his own party in order to make way for Hillary s coronation. Not very democratic of the Democrats. Wasserman-Shultz even resigned as a result. Sanders didn t seem to mind (in public anyway) and voluntarily capitulated, and Hillary enjoyed a steady climb afterwards. From this we can deduce that the Clinton-Sanders contest was likely a contrived affair from the onset, although one WikiLeaks email shows that Sanders may even have been blackmailed into bowing down to Clinton. It seems that the DNC and Clinton never expected Sanders to capture the imagination of the nation s youth like he did, which also speaks volumes about the acute lack of enthusiasm for Clinton s White House run   even within her own party. Sanders was a rock star, Clinton was a pop star. That s a big difference in the eyes of millennials who place a lot of value on authenticity.Then came the debates. The first one broke all ratings records for a political debate with an estimated near 100 million total viewers. It was Gladiator meets Jerry Springer. Then the New York Times leaked some of Trump s tax returns and the media had a field day. Later in October, a barrage of bombshells would besiege the Trump campaign, one after another, ranging from allegations of groping on a first class flight in the 1980 s, to a porn star upset over Trump s manly advances   each of them suddenly appearing in the media right before the election to complain about being sexually harassed by Trump. After the first debate, a rather lurid, leaked off the record audio conversation from Access Hollywood in 2005 appeared which nearly upended his campaign, immediately followed by a new string of women coming forward with more allegations sexual abuse. This devastated Trump in the polls, and became the 24 hour obsession for Democratic Party-linked networks like CNN and MSNBC. Amazingly, every one of the accusers has since disappeared from the scene. The damage was done though, and this became the basis for the Clinton campaign, her TV ads and her surrogates  anti-Trump message.  Just like with Hillary s Podesta emails, it was non-stop media chaos. The attacks and counter attacks were many   too many to mention here.Somehow, he crawled out of that pit and rebounded in the polls.Trump was also being attacked in the media for proffering that the  system is rigged . In all seriousness, does anyone not believe this? Still, critics have called this  extremist  rhetoric from Trump. From a media standpoint however, America s democracy is rigged   and clearly in favor of the Democratic Party. WikiLeaks proved through the release of Clinton Campaign Chair John Podesta s emails   starting with the corruption between DNC acting chair Donna Brazile who cheated the debate process by passing questions from the network CNN   directly to Hillary Clinton. If that wasn t bad enough, it was later revealed how the DNC tried to provide CNN anchor Wolf Blizter with questions to ask Donald Trump, and how DNC staffers offered CNN s Jake Tapper questions to ask during another interview on the network. CNN s chief political correspondent Gloria Borger was also exposed as one of many so-called  journalists  in private contact with the Clinton campaign. The online journal Politico s editor Glenn Thrush was also caught stage-managing coverage with the Clinton campaign. As yet, none of these media operatives have been fired, or have resigned   which says a lot about the corrupt culture of the mainstream media in the United States today. There were many other incidents covered by WikiLeaks, too many to list here. Total collusion between the so-called  press  and the Democratic Party. So, yes, the system is rigged. This is no longer debatable, and the fact that the public now understand this should haunt media operative long after this election. When They Go Low, We Go High While this election may have been bad for the American people, it s been great for one groups of insiders: elite advertising agencies and the TV networks who sell ad space to the campaigns. The Clinton campaign combined with the pro-Clinton Super PACs spent upwards of $200 million on TV ads   the majority of which were negative ads characterizing her competitor as a racist xenophobic womanizing misogynist. By doing so, the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party effectively made their pitch to voters as a referendum on political correctness. In other words,  we can t allow this disgusting human being to win this election.  The other big Clinton TV ad buy was,  We can t let Donald Trump get his hands on the nuclear codes.  This ad was based on the ridiculous premise that a US President could just walk into the Oval Office one day and start launching ICBM warheads around the world for no reason   a completely bogus thesis if there ever was one, but apparently the campaign thought the public was stupid enough to believe this fictional scenario.  As result of the all the negative campaigning, Clinton spent very little if any, substantial time speaking or debating the details of domestic issues and her chequered foreign policy record, particularly regarding the horrendous failures of Libya and Syria. Instead, on numerous occasions, especially during the debates, she would refer people to  my website    as if that s what people really wanted. Normally, people want to hear it from the candidates mouth, but the internet has offered a nice respite for politicians who prefer not to get tangled in discussing real issues in the flesh.It should be noted that from the beginning, the gender argument has been pervasive in all Clinton messaging, almost to the point of entitlement.  It s about time for woman to become president. We re going to make history with the first woman in the White House.  For many Americans, however, this message based purely on identity politics tends to push discussion of the candidate s  credentials and policies to the background. It is also used to fend of any criticism or inquiry into policy specifics. Not surprisingly, Clinton has mostly steered away from specifics or making any promises   unlike her predecessor Obama did when he promised everything imaginable for his first  100 Days  in order to attract votes  including closing the offshore eyesore, Guantanamo Bay Prison, and bringing the troops home from Iraq on his first day. None of this actually happened, which fuelled a lot of disenchantment and skepticism from younger voters this time around. Clinton s gender platform has also been augmented by a racial plank, and the campaign constantly reminds its supporters that blacks and other ethnic minorities should have common cause with women, inferring that their liberal cohorts have also been held back by the cruel customs of a white male-dominated, Anglo-Saxon patriarchal society. In 2016 Democrats have also reintroduced the topic of slavery as a major talking point, resulting in even more tension. Clinton s slogan is  Stronger Together, but one could argue that it s possible the Democratic Party s obsession with promoting identity politics has done more to foster new political and social divisions (and subdivisions), rather than to unite all of society under a common national identity. This is a debate which should happen, but few dare to challenge the political left on that issue. Some food for thought: a recent Rasmussen Poll concluded that race relations in the US have deteriorated under President Obama, the highest dissatisfaction mark since he was elected eight years ago   up 18 points since 2014. Why have  race relations  gone down hill? This poll result appeared for a reason, and it s probably not just because white America was upset they elected a black president in 2008, although this is what Democrats insist when you show them this particular poll. It could also be related to the caustic, relentless confrontational identity politics agenda being pushed by  agents of change  in the new radical left. Or maybe it simply reflects a fundamental failure of a political leadership which only panders to its own side of the aisle   and shuns the other. America will remain divided unless both Democrats and Republicans,  liberals  and  conservatives  can figure one how to overcome this flaw.Although Bill might be his wife s greatest asset, he is also her biggest Achilles heal. Hillary has built her entire political career on the back her two-term husband   with the former First Lady slipping seamlessly into brand Clinton and a ready-made political legacy. After Hillary unleashed the misogynist card on Trump, Bill soon came under fire over his own sordid history of sexual deviance. After that, Bill was used sparingly in pubic. Instead, the Clinton camp relied heavily on the White House to do its campaigning for them. As a result, the First Lady, Michelle Obama and the President did many of the big campaign stops in Hillary s absence. Collectively, it seemed as if Hillary s VIP surrogates did more campaigning than she did herself. Multimillionaire celebrity surrogates lined up to stump for Hillary, including Katie Perry (image, above), Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi, Robert DeNiro, Jennifer Lopez, Madonna, Leonardo DiCaprio, Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, Jay Z, Beyonce and even LeBron James.Looking cool with the kids. So Clinton is being backed by the billionaire Hollywood entertainment wing of the Establishment.Even with all of that celebrity power though, Trump still attracted vastly bigger crowds on his own. But how? Why would a minimum of 15,000 at every stop turn out just for Trump?With more than a touch of irony, the one person who articulated this phenomenon better than anyone else was a radical left-wing icon, filmmaker Michael Moore. He recently filmed a one man show entitled TrumpLand where Moore s said this: I know a lot of people in Michigan that are planning to vote for Trump and they don t necessarily like him that much, and they don t necessarily agree with him. They re not racist or rednecks, they re actually pretty decent people, and so after talking to a number of them I wanted to write this:Donald Trump came to the Detroit Economic Club and stood there in front of Ford Motor executives and said,  if you close these factories as you re planning to do in Detroit and build them in Mexico, I m going to put a 35% tariff on those cars when you send them back and nobody s going to buy them.  It was an amazing thing to see. No politician, Republican or Democrat, had ever said anything like that to these executives, and it was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin   the  Brexit  states. You live here in Ohio, you know what I m talking about. Whether Trump means it or not, is kind of irrelevant because he s saying the things to people who are hurting, and that s why every beaten-down, nameless, forgotten working stiff who used to be part of what was called the middle class loves Trump. He is the human molotov cocktail that they ve been waiting for. The human hand grande that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them.And on November 8, Election Day, although they lost their jobs, although they ve been foreclosed on by the bank, and next came the divorce and now the wife and kids are gone, the car s been repoed, they haven t had a real vacation in years, they re stuck with the shitty Obamacare Bronze Plan where you can t even get a fucking percocet. They ve essentially lost everything they had, except one thing   the one thing that doesn t cost them a cent, and is guaranteed to them by the American constitution: the right to vote. They might be penniless, they might be homeless, they might be fucked over and fucked up it doesn t matter, because it s equalized on that day   a millionaire has the same number of votes as the person without a job: one. And there s more of the former middle class than there are in the millionaire class.So on November 8, the dispossessed will walk into the voting booth, be handed a ballot, close the curtain, and take that lever or felt pen or touchscreen and put a big fucking X in the box by the name of the man who has threatened to upend and overturn the very system that has ruined their lives: Donald J. Trump. They see that the elite who ruined their lives hate Trump. Corporate America hates Trump. Wall Street hates Trump. The career politicians hate Trump. The media hates Trump, after they loved him and created him, and now hate. Yes, on November 8, you Joe Blow, Steve Blow, Bob Blow, Billy Blow, all the Blows get to go and blow up the whole goddamn system because it s your right. Trump s election is going to be the biggest fuck ever recorded in human history and it will feel good. Reading that, you can t help but feel that Moore has some real anger issues. Nonetheless, he inadvertently delivered the best pro-Trump speech of the election.For many, including Michael Moore, Trump might not be the ideal vehicle for such a profound movement, and yet, he is that vehicle.Granted, half of the American population have been conditioned to hate Trump for various reasons. But many of them are missing the key point in the Trump story, just like they did in the Sanders story. Trump offered millions of voters something profound: the idea that even in today s insulated political fortress that is Washington DC, anything is still possible in American politics   where an outsider can come in and shake up a stale and corrupt ruling class.This concept should not be underestimated. It s a fundamental tenet of the American culture. As flawed an individual as he might be   at this moment in time, Donald Trump is the avatar who embodies this idea of opportunity and hope.In today s political reality show and infotainment media environment, timing is everything and America loves a comeback. Trump s late October surge in the polls certainly reflected that public sentiment and overall enthusiasm. Trump has flown more miles and visited more cities than any other presidential candidate in memory   so he s not leaving much on the table in terms of energy. Will this translate into votes in key swing states? We ll see Sure, when it all started, Donald Trump was Mickey Mouse, but somewhere along the way, the novelty has transformed into a bona fide movement. The fact that Trump, a candidate with zero political experience, bested a total of 16 other GOP primary candidates   all of whom were seasoned, career politicians   revealed just how profoundly unpopular establishment party stalwarts are with the general electorate. No amount of TV advertising can gloss over this realty. What began as a  protest vote  for so many who no longer trust or feel any affinity with elite politicians, has since morphed into a powerful mandate for change.Trump s victory during the GOP primaries was also historic   it signalled an outright rejection of the party establishment, of the constant banal Republican bickering over who is the  most conservative,  and the traditional construct of the polished politician. Trump smashed all of this. He has done exactly as Reagan did in the 1980 s   he pole vaulted over a stiff, entrenched establishment   and took his message directly to the people.On the Democratic Party slate, the exact same phenomenon unfolded, with candidate Bernie Sanders gathering tens of millions of anti-establishment and anti-war voters in the 12 months preceding the Democratic Party Convention. In modern media terms Sanders couldn t be any less appealing   with his unkept hair, the dandruff flaking off of the shoulders of his dodgy suit coats, and a semi-hunchback look. His supporters couldn t care less. The legions of college aged students didn t seem to care about the looks or the lack of Clintonesque cleverly scripted sound bites. Sanders could rattle off facts and issues without a teleprompter, and he did it with genuine conviction   something Clinton still struggles with. Regarding the wars, as Sanders rightly pointed out, unlike Hillary Clinton, he voted against the Iraq War in 2003. This also resonated with the grassroots base. Additionally, unlike his opponent, Sanders was not pandering to Wall Street and accepting large sums of money from elite financial interests.To his base, Sanders was the real deal   and for the same reasons that Trump s base is still behind him. The political and media establishment have gone to great lengths to conceal this reality, but in doing so they are only delaying their eventual demise.This is a long tail trend which is not going to reverse itself, and it s not confined to the US either   it s international. We saw this to some extent with the BREXIT vote this past summer which defied the political media establishment s version of consensus reality. Political stalwarts and generational glad-handers will try their hardest to ignore it, but it s a clear public mandate   away from the carefully controlled establishment model of politics. Last year in Britain, millions of voters shunned the Labour Party establishment and mainstream media favorites, and instead threw massive support behind the current Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Like Sanders, Corbyn is not a media poster boy. Before this year, you d have been hard-pressed to spot the aging Corbyn clean-shaven, or wearing a suit, much less a tie. This political shift confounded all of the  experts  and has triggered a tectonic shift in the Labour Party itself, as acolytes and devotees of former Prime Minister Tony Blair have all but thrown their toys out of their prams over the Corbyn issue. Like with Sanders, the people gathered in droves behind a brazenly anti-establishment and antiwar leader who was cast aside by the party establishment and media operatives.In Italy, a similar populist movement is well under way with the Five Star Movement, originally launched in 2011 by Italian comedian and entertainer Beppe Grillo. Five Star are now in Parliament. The term  Five Star  symbolizes five key issues for the party: public water, sustainable transport, sustainable development, right to internet access, and environmentalism. Similarly, Spain has recently seen the world s first crowd-funded political party with Podemos (translated  We Can ). This is the future.As far as the lesser of two evils is concerned, the corruption issue weighs heavier with Clinton. While Trump s scandals derive from his private and business life, Clinton s scandals are from her time in public office, and involve current and past Democratic political operatives and appointees   and so they deserve more scrutiny and accountability as they were done on taxpayer time, and bound by supposed strict codes of conduct. In stead, the media has worked hard to equate various mini-scandals from Trump with the mega-scandals of the Clintons when clearly these are two different things. Sp far, Clinton seems to have been able to remain above the law   which has done a lot to fuel resentment against her, the White House and a highly politicized Department of Justice..On paper, America has a stark choice. Donald Trump seems to be an anti-globalist, anti-TPP, free market oriented, populist nationalist. Hillary Clinton seems to represent  equality for all,  but more than that she represents the status quo, a continuation of Barack Obama and his failing Obamacare legacy, an establishment elitist globalist agenda with a radical leftist bent.But how much will either candidate s presidency actually resemble their campaigns?If Clinton wins you can expect a huge celebrity-studded Gala Ball in Washington DC, followed by 18 months of Congressional hearings, indictments, impeach hearings and general gridlock. Expect the usual cast of suspects in her Cabinet, surrounded by all the usual insiders. Expect Bill to be named Hillary s  Economic Tsar.  In the Democratic tradition, Hillary will raise taxes and increase spending. This is why Wall Street loves Clinton (and why she accepts their money), because like with Obama, Clinton s Washington will certainly sink further into debt   and Wall Street profits from this debt. Also, expect the Clintons  net worth to sky rocket. Still, with so many scandals already on the boiler, it will get ugly, and it will stay ugly. There will be gridlock well into 2020. Like Obama did with the issue of  race,  Clinton will certainly make gender the defining issue of her presidency, as well as continue hammering home the idea that America has a  race  problem. The culture wars will continue and America will become a cultural Marxist battleground. Hillary Clinton s America will be a sectarian America. So expect those Rasmussen numbers to continue on their present trajectory. Expect Trump supporters to call foul on  vote rigging  too.There will be some vote rigging, as there has been in many US elections. Just this past week, there have been multiple cases of voter fraud in the US (and these are only the cases where people have actually been caught). . With Hillary, sooner than later, you can also expect an escalation of rhetoric and ill-informed talk of  No Fly Zones  in Syria and military a confrontation with Russia, and possibly even Iran. Lots of wars and proxy wars. This is why the Neocons love Hillary.If Trumps wins, the mainstream media will be in a state of shock, followed by a state of panic, followed by a state of chaos. Sure, Trump may wish to unite America, but this is a near insurmountable task now after 8 years of Sharpton-Obama political agitation and other artificial divisions constructed through hundreds of  progressive  front organizations funded by social engineers like billionaire George Soros. If Trump wins, expect the likes of Soros and MoveOn.org to unleash wave after wave of flash mobs, who will protest, riot, smash and burn their way on to CNN s 24 hour news rotation. Expect Occupy 2.0, and #BlackLivesMatter to rage. You can also be certain that Clinton, the Democrats and their media operatives at CNN, MSNBC and others, will blame Vladimir Putin and the Russians for hacking the US election in favor of Trump. Although Trump may cut taxes, like Reagan he will likely balloon federal spending. It is also unlikely Trump will make any significant dent in the national debt which is currently hovering around $10 trillion. However, with Trump, there is a chance to de-escalate the aggressive posturing this current White House and Hillary Clinton have take against Russia. This would be an important benefit of a Trump presidency   a chance for a positive relationship between the US and Russia.Regardless of which person wins, expect FBI director Jim Comey to resign after this election.Expect both candidates to prosecute their  war on ISIS , their  war on poverty , their  war on drugs  and their  war on domestic extremism. The election result is only the beginning. The real battle will take place afterwards.Expect a heavily divided and half bitter nation.Expect serious political party alternatives to emerge, building on the mild successes of the Libertarian and Green parties.Tomorrow, history will be made by either the outsider Trump, or the insider Clinton.When you re talking about the outsiders though, whether it s Trump, Sanders, Corbyn or Grillo, no matter how pious or forthright, they will ultimately get caught in the gears of government, with all its trappings of nepotism and institutional corruption. The outsider eventually becomes the insider. Resisting that pressure is the age-old challenge to any reformer.If there s one lesson to be learned by this year s US presidential race, it s certainly an old lesson by now. Depending on what your view of communism is, Karl Marx is either a villain or a hero of social engineering, but he left us some interesting quotes. Marx did get one thing right when he said,  Elections give the people the right every few years to choose which member of the ruling class will misrepresent them.  It s still true today.Or as someone once said,  No matter who you vote for the government always gets in. We ll see which government gets in tomorrow.READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"November 8, 2016"
23179,"Hillary Clinton Survives Another FBI Pantomime, 650,000 Emails Investigated in 691,000 Seconds"," Claire Bernish Free Thought ProjectIn no surprise to anyone paying even marginal attention, the FBI s clearing Hillary Clinton of wrongdoing in its briefly reopened investigation   however, the time it took the agency to reach this conclusion is not only bereft of logic and reason, it constitutes the most hubristic of insults to the public s intelligence.In just 691,000 seconds from announcement to conclusion, FBI Director James Comey wants you to believe that agents thoroughly examined over 650,000 emails newly  discovered  on Anthony Weiner s computer   including any threads resulting, as well as all attachments   before deciding Clinton innocent of wrongdoing.We, the people of this planet, are just not that stupid   nor are we even mildly amused by this farcical bullshit passed off as a credible investigation.Indeed, the lightning pace of this putative second investigation not only boggles the mind, it forces uneasy questions concerning the true motivation and apparent exceeding necessity to ensure Hillary Clinton walks away scott-free amid rapidly mushrooming evidence of flagrant corruption and mendacious collusion.Just a cursory comparison of two investigations shows such marked differences it would be impossible not to question legitimacy of the FBI s findings.In the summer of 2015, the FBI commenced its first probe into the former secretary of state s use of a private email server during her tenure in office, after John Giacalone   then Director of the National Security Branch   met with Comey to voice concerns emanating from the Intelligence community about classified information possibly handled carelessly.For nearly a full year   365 days, or 31,536,000 seconds   a sizable task force of FBI agents pored over an enormous cache, first comprising of 30,000 emails, but later totaling 44,900 after additional documents not originally handed over by the Clinton camp to the State Department were discovered.This means   rounding off the rough estimate of one year   the Bureau combed an average of just over 123 documents every day.While that might seem to be manageable with a slew of investigators on the job, a basic comparison of the two probes proves the literal inanity of the reopened investigation.Later in the day on October 28, Comey announced the commencement of the secondary probe   albeit to the consternation of current and former officials who felt his telling Congress broke a number of investigatory guidelines, including possibly influencing the outcome of the presidential race.According to Comey, an additional 650,000 documents located on the computer of Clinton aide Huma Abedin s now-disgraced and estranged husband Anthony Weiner deserved careful scrutiny for pertinence and relevance to the original investigation of the Democratic nominee.Public and official speculation predicted a months- or years-long investigation, even with substantial manpower dedicated to the task.But on Sunday, November 6, in yet another shocker of an announcement from the FBI director, Comey inexplicably declared nothing of relevance to the Clinton investigation    no new conclusions    had been revealed in its secondary probe.This means   again rounding for brevity to eight days the total length of the investigation   FBI agents inspected some 81,250 documents each day.Granted, both estimates have been averaged and roughened, but only for comparison s sake   and that contrast doesn t survive the scantiest litmus test of believability.Not at all.Before the nay-sayers jump in with a there s no comparison deflection, consider the following points.Although an algorithm or program combing those documents might indeed retrieve subjects of interest to investigators   keywords, germane subjects, accordant people s names, and the like   in no way would such technological gatekeepers reveal subtle nuance as has been displayed in emails published by Wikileaks from Hillary Clinton, campaign chair John Podesta, and the Democratic National Committee.Such fine gradations of meaning, naturally found in the English language but also purposefully employed to throw off investigators and interlopers, could not possibly be revealed by artificial means   at least not that quickly and particularly not with currently-available technologies.Still not convinced?Consider that if such technology did indeed exist to that discerning level of scrutiny in our heightened and overarching surveillance and police states, no criminal would ever roam free.Law enforcement departments and the National Security Agency together have amassed astonishingly voluminous data sets on every person in this country, including through emails and online activities. A technology advanced enough to comb for subtleties in language would hone in on criminal behavior and activity with incredible frequency.And while NSA programs have been revealed to hunt for keywords, there are limits to its effectiveness   no terrorist plot has yet been halted in progress because the intelligence to discover it hasn t yet solidified to that point.Technology experts immediately weighed in claiming such technology does indeed exist, is frequently employed, and can do the job perfectly in a mere eight days  no worries...Continue reading at Free Thought Project***SEE ALSO: Hillary s Russian Hack Hoax: The Biggest Lie of this Election SeasonREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"November 7, 2016"
23180,WARNING: Don’t Worry If the Stock Market Goes Crazy After Election," BloombergIn the hours after the president is elected, equity investors need to brace for volatility. What they shouldn t do is panic.That s because regardless of how prices react on Nov. 9, next-day moves in the S&P 500 Index are useless in telling what comes after.While the index swings an average 1.5 percent the day after the vote, gains or losses over the first 24 hours predict the market s direction 12 months later less than half the time.This matters because the compulsion to act in the vote s aftermath is often very strong   stocks swing twice as violently as normal those days, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They plummeted 5 percent just after Barack Obama beat John McCain in 2008. But while nothing says Wednesday s reaction won t be a harbinger for the year, nothing says it will, either, and investors should think before doing anything rash.  Trying to trade that is very difficult,  said Thomas Melcher, the Philadelphia-based chief investment officer at PNC Asset Management Group.  Even if the market sells off, if you have any reasonable time horizon, that should be a buying opportunity. The dust will settle and people will conclude the economy is OK. In the 22 elections going back to 1928, the S&P 500 has fallen 15 times the day after polls close, for an average loss of 1.8 percent Continue this story at BloombergREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"November 7, 2016"

23187,Why Hillary Clinton is Responsible for US Failures in Libya and Syria,"Patrick Henningsen 21st Century Wire Hillary Clinton is the architect of US foreign policy failures in Libya and Syria.   We ve heard that statement many times over the course of this US election cycle, but exactly how much truth is there to it? After researching this issue, one quickly learns that it s not only true, it s an understatement. She wasn t just an architect, she was a chief instigator. Clinton s main source of resume credibility is her tenure as US Secretary of State from January 21, 2009 to February 1, 2013. During that time, Clinton resided over the planning and conception of two devastating conflicts, Libya and Syria. These two disasters will ultimately define both the Obama and Clinton legacies, and not for the reasons one might think. I would like to stress that the case being made here is not a political one, it is a moral and ethical inquiry into the actions and conduct of a public official.Before we get into Libya, which itself is a detailed and grave tale of nation building gone wrong, let s look closely at Syria   a conflict (not a Civil War) which has been dominating the international conversation for the last 4 years, but even more intensely in the last 18 months. Thus far, the results of US policy are abominable.What ownership does Clinton have over today s Syria? Today, the conflict is still being fuelled by tens of thousands of US and Gulf-backed militants, mostly of foreign origin, who comprise multiple Takfiri terrorist groups which the US insist calling  rebels.  This conclave includes the Islamic State (ISIS/Daesh), Al Nusra Front (al Qaeda in Syria), Arar al Sham, Nour al-din al-Zenki, Jaish al-Fatah (The Army of Conquest), along with many others. These armed groups are occupying strategic civilian areas throughout Syria, and it is a statement of fact that these terrorists are using civilian populations as human shields.A US-led  Coalition  is currently flying over Syria and Iraq, supposedly  fighting ISIS,  but is also coming dangerously close to conflict with both the Syrian and Russian militaries.Although this situation is now way beyond the pale, there was a time back in 2012 when a genuine diplomatic intervention could have helped to alter a fatal course of events.Hillary Clinton played a crucial role in initiating the current disaster.During a presidential primary debate in Milwaukee in February 2016, Clinton was quick to boast about her many  achievements  as Secretary of State, especially in Syria: You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution. At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together. It s a nice statement, but like so many of Clinton s policy eulogies, it has no basis in reality.Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development Solutions, sets Clinton straight explaining, In 2012, Clinton was the obstacle, not the solution, to a ceasefire being negotiated by UN Special Envoy Kofi Annan. It was US intransigence   Clinton s intransigence   that led to the failure of Annan s peace efforts in the spring of 2012, a point well-known among diplomats. Despite Clinton s insinuation in the Milwaukee debate, there was (of course) no 2012 ceasefire, only escalating carnage. Clinton bears heavy responsibility for that carnage, which has by now displaced more than 10 million Syrians and left more than 250,000 dead. Clinton s job, like most US diplomats, was to uphold the public facade that Washington is engaging in its usual list of honorable pursuits like cease fires,  peace plans  and protecting human rights   while simultaneously helping to advance a covert agenda that achieves the exact opposite: destabilization, escalation of violence, flooding the region with weapons, and of course, working to overthrow the government of Syria. We want to pay special attention to the weapons trafficking part. Clinton was pivotal   not only in coordinating with the Gulf states, but also giving political legitimacy to arming the  moderate rebels  (now commonly recognized as terrorists).Although the initial effort to fuel the armed insurgency in Syria was organized through Libya under the office of Secretary Clinton (which we ll demonstrate below), later efforts were formalized through a series of large weapons shipments out of NATO countries like Croatia, and then through other US-sanctioned covert smuggling projects like Operation Timber Sycamore, where the CIA, with the approval of President Obama, organized weapons shipments into Syria via Turkey and Jordan, but with Saudi Arabia footing the bill for that clandestine operation. The New York Times confirmed certain details of this in January 2016: American officials have not disclosed the amount of the Saudi contribution, which is by far the largest from another nation to the program to arm the rebels against President Bashar al-Assad s military. But estimates have put the total cost of the arming and training effort at several billion dollars. Perhaps the most important aspect of this story is this: it is absolutely illegal under International Law for foreign nations to conspire and trafficking arms into a country with the intent to overthrow the government of a nation-state.Now that might be a cause for concern for those wanting to recognize the international rule of law, but the United States, the Obama and Clinton regime has done this without any compunction at all. History shows however, that such overt flouting of international law places the entire basis of the Geneva Conventions and the United Nations at risk. Beyond this, it is also a running violation of US law in terms of providing material support (weapons, cash, supplies, intelligence and logistical support, and even political backing) to internationally recognized terrorist organizations. On those two points alone, Hillary Clinton should be not only disqualified for public office in the US, but should also face another criminal indictment for her role, along with every other US public official involved in sanctioning these operations, including Barack Obama, Senator John McCain, and a number of other US officials like Mike Rogers, former Republican Congressman from Michigan and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee when Timber Sycamore began.  FRIENDS OF SYRIA  : Secretary Clinton with Saudi and Qatari government officials in 2012, conspiring to destroy Syria.From 2011, Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was effectively the public-facing CEO of the cynically titled,  Friends of Syria.  This was essentially a lobbying tour, bringing together NATO members, the Arab League and the  Syrian Opposition  all together to promote a policy of regime change for Syria. In reality, it was really a vehicle for raising money and planning for war. Here Clinton was flanked by her Saudi Arabian and Qatari donors to the Clinton Foundation, along with then UK Foreign Secretary William Hague, Turkey s prime minister, Recep Tayip Erdogan, a hand-picked puppet government-in-exile called the  Syrian National Council,  and other  stakeholders    all vying for a piece of Syria.Behind the pomp and circumstance, however, all parties were openly conspiring to arm militants for the purpose of upending the government in Damascus. Clinton effectively steered this process throughout her time in the cabinet   a destructive process which has led to the bloodbath we see today. To any rational observer, the whole enterprise would be viewed as a failure; in terms of human loss, the refugee crisis, sectarian violence, and breeding terrorism for the next 30 or 40 years   and yet, somehow Hillary Clinton is counting this as one of her  achievements.  Here, Sachs offers an accurate take on Clinton s abysmal legacy in Syria: .. she joined Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and right-wing Israelis to try to isolate, even defeat, Iran. In 2010, she supported secret negotiations between Israel and Syria to attempt to wrest Syria from Iran s influence. Those talks failed. Then the CIA and Clinton pressed successfully for Plan B: to overthrow Assad.When the unrest of the Arab Spring broke out in early 2011, the CIA and the anti-Iran front of Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey saw an opportunity to topple Assad quickly and thereby to gain a geopolitical victory. Clinton became the leading proponent of the CIA-led effort at Syrian regime change.In early 2011, Turkey and Saudi Arabia leveraged local protests against Assad to try to foment conditions for his ouster. By the spring of 2011, the CIA and the US allies were organizing an armed insurrection against the regime. On August 18, 2011, the US Government made public its position:  Assad must go. Since then and until the recent fragile UN Security Council accord, the US has refused to agree to any ceasefire unless Assad is first deposed. The US policy under Clinton and until recently has been: regime change first, ceasefire after. After all, it s only Syrians who are dying. Annan s peace efforts were sunk by the United States  unbending insistence that U.S.-led regime change must precede or at least accompany a ceasefire. As the Nation editors put it in August 2012:The US demand that Assad be removed and sanctions be imposed before negotiations could seriously begin, along with the refusal to include Iran in the process, doomed [Annan s] mission.Despite the billions spent on arming and training  rebels , the millions of refugees and the hundreds of thousands dead   Assad did not  go  as per the grand plan.Things continue to go septic. A recently released WikiLeaks email from a 2014 exchange between Clinton campaign chair, then White House advisor to President Obama, John Podesta, where the pair openly discuss common knowledge that the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar are funding ISIS terrorists. While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region,  Clinton wrote. This effort will be enhanced by the stepped up commitment in the [Kurdish Regional Government]. The Qataris and Saudis will be put in a position of balancing policy between their ongoing competition to dominate the Sunni world and the consequences of serious U.S. pressure. In his recent interview with Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and filmmaker John Pilger, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange explains an unsettling criminal connection between Clinton and her family foundation: All serious analysts know, and even the US government has agreed, that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIS and funding ISIS, but the dodge has always been that it is some  rogue  princes using their oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS. Aside from verifying what many already suspected, this proves that the Clinton Foundation knowingly accepted millions of dollars in  charitable  donations from the same Gulf states which both Secretary Clinton and President Obama knew were funding ISIS, Al Nusra Front (al Qaeda in Syria), and the rest.Taken as a whole, this represents a level of corruption that would preclude anyone from running for office, let alone the US Presidency and yet, this issue receives very little airtime in the US. The reason for this is simple: both Democrats and Republicans are up to their neck in Washington s Dirty War on Syria. Illegal Gun-running Out of Benghazi, LibyaWhen the initial Benghazi story broke in the US, the media and the Republican politicians focused almost exclusively on the US casualties during militant raids on a CIA annex and makeshift US embassy in Benghazi. Four men died on September 11th and 12th, 2012   U.S. Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens, U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith, and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty. Ten others were wounded in the fighting.During the aftermath, US media and GOP opposition made the story all about Hillary Clinton and the White House s  failure  to send reinforcements which they argue could have  saved American lives.   While this may have been true, it ignores the real story. This diversion was done in order to steer the narrative away from the bipartisan effort to traffic massive amounts of illegal weapons from Libya, and into the hands of US-NATO and Gulf-backed  rebels  in Syria.We now know that Clinton s diplomat Christopher Stevens was providing diplomatic cover for a CIA operation to transfer ex-Libyan military weapons stocks over to Syria. Many islamist fighters who fought with NATO to bring down Gaddafi in 2011 were later transferred from Libya to Syria to fight against the Syrian government.Still, despite all of this the collapse of Washington s puppet government the National Transitional Council (NTC), and Libya rapidly descending into a failed state, and the emergence of a new ISIS beach head there   Clinton s inner circle remained clueless and only seem to be concerned with promoting  HRC  credentials in advance of her presidential run. Gateway Pundit adds: Hillary s team provides Clinton credit for her many actions that led to Qadhafi s toppling in Libya including, but not limited to: suspending the operations of the Libyan embassy in Washington; evacuating US embassy personnel in Tripoli and closing the embassy there; obtaining sanctions against Qadhafi and his family; working to suspend Libya from the Human Rights Council; appointing Special Envoy Chris Stevens to be the U.S. representative to Benghazi; engaging with UAE, Qatar, and Jordan to seek their participation in coalition operations; holding meetings with House Democrats and Senate Republicans to persuade them not to de-fund the Libya operation; and lastly, it was noted that Hillary worked to construct a $1.5 billion assets package to the National Transitional Council or NTC. Hillary saw this email sent to her from Cheryl Mills because as noted at WikiLeaks she asked for it to be printed in a subsequent email to a colleague. This email proves that Clinton s team created a list to show her responsibility for being the architect behind the overthrow of Qadhafi in Libya and the subsequent horror as a result. It is now known that the NTC in Libya is no longer in charge but it is unknown what happened to the $1.5 billion Hillary pushed to prop up this group. Here is the email via Scribd:NeoCon BedfellowsWith all the hysterical rhetoric by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party this year about  Russia Hacking the US Elections,  it should be pointed out that Clinton s State Department engineered a complete overthrow of a foreign government in Ukraine.There is also the case of the foul-mouthed Victoria Nuland (photo, left), Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs   appointed by Clinton and charged with organizing Washington s 2014 coup d etat in Kiev.Clinton s appointee Nuland absolutely key in destabilizing the Ukraine, a move which effectively ruined US-Russian relations, leading us right up to the present geopolitical confrontation over Syria.During the m l e Nuland was also caught on tape with US Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt, discussing which hand-pick Washington-approved people would be filling which positions in their new unelected junta government, including the office of Prime Minister. Listen to this stunning call: Award-winning journalist Robert Parry adds,  The fact is that Clinton has generally marched in lock step with the neocons as they have implemented an aggressive  regime change  strategy against governments and political movements that don t toe Washington s line or that deviate from Israel s goals in the Middle East. So she has backed coups, such as in Honduras (2009) and Ukraine (2014); invasions, such as Iraq (2003) and Libya (2011); and subversions such as Syria (from 2011 to the present) all with various degrees of disastrous results. The No Fly Zone FantasyAnother big problem is that Clinton sees her path to war in Syria through a No Fly Zone, to  Save the poor children of Aleppo. Although it sounds good during a TV debate, it is very unrealistic in practical terms, and if implemented, it would place the US squarely at war with both Russia and Syria, and possible Iran by extension. Is that the best Clinton has to offer?  Prof Michel Chossudovsky explains the fundamental flaw in Clinton s proclamation:At the third presidential debate, Hillary Clinton reasserted her commitment that if elected president, she would implement a no-fly-zone, intimating that the objective was to  save lives : I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict. I am well aware of the really legitimate concerns you have expressed from both the president and the general,  Clinton said in response to a question from Fox News debate moderator Chris Wallace. This would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation and would also take making it clear to the Russians and Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground   I think we could strike a deal and make it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interest of the people on the ground in Syria.  (Fox News, emphasis added)At present, under the Obama administration, the joint chiefs of staff are opposed to the  No Fly zone .The Joint Chiefs of Staff are appointed by the Secretary of Defense.Under a Clinton presidency, a new Secretary of Defense as well as a new Chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, firmly committed to  A No fly Zone  over Syria would be appointed.Mich le Angelique Flournoy, a former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy is Hillary s choice for the position of Secretary of Defense, who favors the  No Fly Zone  option. Most considerate and informed commentators now accept that a No Fly Zone is an act of war. Clinton of all people should know this after Libya.Loosening Legal Requirements for WarLast week, vice presidential running mate, Tim Kaine, said that if elected, Hillary Clinton would press lawmakers to rewrite the Sept. 14, 2001, Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF)   making it even easier to  go to war  without having the actually declare war with a Congressional vote. This bill has been a favorite of Obama who has used it as an open-ended executive path to multiple undeclared wars of aggression, and to make his war on ISIS appear legal, for now anyway.According to Kaine, Clinton believes that,  it s time for us to take that now-outdated authorization, and really think about what we are confronting, and work together to reach some legislative-executive accord about what it is we re doing.  Kaine told Axelrod.  It s time for Congress to get back in the game and refine and revise that authorization. This is nothing more than another Washington lawyer s parlor trick   to pass another AUMF bill to cover the old one. The script just keeps getting revised.This was reiterated by Clinton campaign spokesman Jesse Lehrich in July when he told Yahoo News that Clinton agrees with Senator Kaine that if we are serious about confronting ISIS, Congress ought to express its resolve to stand behind our military and win this fight by passing a new AUMF. The legislation reflected his national security aides  desire that it not tie his hands. The document authorized airstrikes in Iraq and Syria in the following three years. It forbade the use of American ground troops in  enduring offensive ground combat operations    a term the White House described as deliberately vague. It also allowed strikes against  individuals and organizations fighting for, on behalf of, or alongside ISIL  anywhere in the world.Democrats have balked at supporting such a sweeping measure. Republicans have pointed to the three-year limit and the ground-combat language to argue that the AUMF improperly binds the hands of Obama s successor.The truth of the matter is that both sides see political peril in the president s proposal. Democrats recall how voting in favor of the Iraq War helped to doom Clinton s 2008 presidential ambitions. And Republicans, who could vote to remove the language they describe as objectionable, prefer to criticize Obama s handling of the conflict without taking any steps that might make them co-owners of the strategy. A lawyer s blueprint for a continuation of Washington s status quo: unconstitutional open-ended, undeclared wars of aggression, anywhere, any time.A Threat to World PeaceLike Obama, and Bush before him, and Bill Clinton before them, as president Hillary Clinton will be expected to expedite an establishment agenda written by transnational corporations and other nebulous international crime syndicates. The financial engine for this is the banking houses of Wall Street and the City of London. A basic review of the Clinton s intimate relationship with Goldman Sachs investment house should provide amble proof of Bill and Hillary s ties to that circle. This shows how, throughout their career, the Clintons have been owned and operated by these banking houses.SEE ALSO: PARTNERS IN CRIME: Goldman Sachs, The Clintons & Wall StreetSuffice to say, based on this and many other exhibits which we have left out here, Hillary Clinton is a clear and present threat to world peace.This is not to say the Donald Trump presidency will be a halcyon affair either, but we don t know that yet. This is another problem with this heavily politicized topic in the US. In order to derail any critique of Clinton s chequered past, many Clinton supporters and die-hard liberal Democrats will try to equate to words of private citizen Donald Trump with the actions of public official Hillary Clinton. If we are having a rational argument then that would simply be a false comparison.If Donald Trump were to assume the office of Presidency, then I would not hesitate to apply as harsh an analysis to his actions and policies.In terms of foreign policy and government corruption   Trump is an unknown quantity, while Hillary Clinton is very well-known one, as we have demonstrated. We have already seen her handy work in both Libya and Syria. Likewise, we have seen the fruits of Bill Clinton s misadventures in Bosnia, Serbia and Kosovo, not to mention his menacing economic sanctions in Iraq which killed upwards of 1 million Iraqi civilians over a ten-year period, and sowed the seeds for future wars.It should also be noted that Senator Hillary Clinton voted for the Iraq War in 2003   a war waged on a false pretense,  although she now claims the war was a  mistake. After a joint US-Terrorist operation that ended in the assassination and street lynching of Libya leader Mumaur Gaddafi near the town of Sirte in October 2011, during a CBS interview, a gloating Hillary Clinton made one of the most callous and disturbing remarks ever from a high-ranking diplomat when she said: We came, we saw, he died!  and proceeded to laugh on camera.This clip really sums up the attitude and moral vacuum we might experience with a Clinton White House:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dmp3Jndj_o .

23188,"FBI: Clinton Foundation investigation will lead to ‘Likely Indictment,’ donors funded ISIS","21st Century Wire says Yesterday we learned that for more than one year the FBI s White Collar Crime Division has actually been investigating a pay-for-play activity between Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. The investigation has been going on for more than a year. According FOX anchor Bret Baier, multiple FBI sources said,  indictments are likely. This could get very interesting A number of new revelations could really raise the temperature on this scandal:Last night, an RT Exclusive revealed what Julian Assange described as, the most significant email in the whole collection. Conveniently ignored by the mainstream media, WikiLeaks had previously highlighted an early 2014 email where outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is urging John Podesta, then an advisor to President Barack Obama, to  bring pressure  on Qatar and Saudi Arabia,  which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [Islamic State, IS, ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups.  Yes. You read that correctly: the Clinton Foundation was accepting millions of dollars in donations from the very Gulf states she knew were funding ISIS and Al Nusra terrorists   thus exposing the charade the Clinton and the Obama Administration have been playing ever since the  ISIS crisis  began in June 2014.Fox News Channel s Bret Baier reported on the latest details of the Clinton Foundation investigation from two sources inside the FBI. He reveals five important new pieces of information in these two short clips:1. The Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far and has been going on for more than a year. 2. The laptops of Clinton aides Cherryl Mills and Heather Samuelson have not been destroyed, and agents are currently combing through them. The investigation has interviewed several people twice, and plans to interview some for a third time. 3. Agents have found emails believed to have originated on Hillary Clinton s secret server on Anthony Weiner s laptop. They say the emails are not duplicates and could potentially be classified in nature. 4. Sources within the FBI have told Baier that an indictment is  likely  in the case of pay-for-play at the Clinton Foundation,  barring some obstruction in some way  from the Justice Department. 5. FBI sources say with 99% accuracy that Hillary Clinton s server has been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and that information has  been taken from it.(Source: Real Clear Politics) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2iIr6ugheQ . Conclusion: Limbaugh took his postiion many days ago, and based on the potential gravity of Assange s recent Clinton-ISIS email revelation   this looks to be a compelling smoking gun. Therefore, Limbaugh looks to be stunningly accurate in his assessment.

23189,Hillary Clinton Jumps the Shark with ‘Trump’s Secret Russian Server’ Conspiracy Theory," 21st Century Wire says Yesterday, WikiLeaks editor and founder Julian Assange confirmed what 21WIRE already knew   that Hillary Clinton and the Obama White House s claim of the US election process being  hacked by the Russian government  was a desperate work of fiction. Not content with that fish tale, Hillary Clinton took the narrative to an embarrassing new low (if that was even possible) with another, wilder made-up conspiracy story about the Russians. The following statement made by Hillary Clinton yesterday epitomizes the term  jumping the shark :It's time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia. https://t.co/D8oSmyVAR4 pic.twitter.com/07dRyEmPjX  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 31, 2016Apparently, Hillary Clinton s campaign staff fed her a planted online news story (by the Clinton campaign?) which ran on a questionable pro-Democratic Party online news outlet. On Monday, the Slate ran the story by one of its alleged journalists  named Franklin Foer, complete with a clickbait blog-like headline,  Was a Trump Server Communicating With Russia? Whatever legitimacy the Slate had before last night, just evaporated.John Roberts from Forbes explains,  The bottom line is that Slate screwed up by publishing this in the first place, and by adding more kooky misinformation to an already addled election season. As for Foer, he says on Twitter a  follow up  piece is in the works. Roberts rightly points out that the only follow-up story for this lemon should start with the word RETRACTION.  CYBER FEUD: Assange believes Clinton has gone beyond the pale with her Russian conspiracy obsession.During his exclusive interview with award-winning filmmaker John Pilger, when asked what he thought of Hillary Clinton s shrill antics, Julian Assange said,  I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person, because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick. The saddest thing about this and the other dishonest and destructive actions of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party   is that no one in the party seems to see anything wrong with this level of deceit and dishonesty. Like Hillary Clinton in her sociopathic path to power, the party rank and file are acting like a cult coven following their high priestess.Still, Clinton surrogates in the media are trying to equate Clinton simultaneously scapegoating and baiting another nuclear superpower  with a decade-old misogynist hot mic audio excerpt of Donald Trump in a TMZ-style tabloid sting. That pretty much sums up Democratic Party strategy for this election season.Assange was right. Clinton, the Democratic Party and their surrogate, are eating themselves. Such are the spoils of power in Washington that men and women will do and say anything to have it.READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"November 4, 2016"
23190,"PARTNERS IN CRIME: Goldman Sachs, The Clintons & Wall Street","Shawn Helton 21st Century WireThe cozy relationship between Goldman Sachs and the Clintons has reached dizzying new heights in recent years, giving the Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton an immensely influential partner on Wall Street.As the public and most of the mainstream media is still processing the political bombshell concerning the newly reopened FBI probe into the Hillary Clinton s email server case   the global investment banking firm Goldman Sachs quietly endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate this past week.The financial ties that bind the Clintons and Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs are nothing new, but never before have the connections been so exposed. Let s take a trip down collusion lane to review some of the more questionable examples of their political and financial merger formed long ago   MONEY CHANGERS    Wall Street s Goldman Sachs are inextricably linked to the Clinton s and The Clinton Foundation. (Photo illustration 21WIRE)The Clintons & Goldman Sachs While campaigning for his first term in the White House, former president Bill Clinton received an enormous amount of support from Washington insider lobbyists and investment banking firms on Wall Street.At the top of the pile sat Goldman Sachs In 1992, the LA Times reported that presidential nominee Bill Clinton, received the largest share of his financial support at least $2.6 million from lawyers and lobbyists,  and that Clinton also received additional support from big securities firms such as Goldman, Sachs & Co. in New York and Stephens Inc. in his hometown of Little Rock, Ark. In fact, Goldman Sachs employees and their family members were responsible for the biggest contributions from a single firm: $98,700. For decades the Clintons have remained close allies to the banking behemoth Goldman Sachs and in the process, a mutually beneficial relationship has taken hold, something that even the NY Times admits: Over 20-plus years, Goldman provided the Clintons with some of their most influential advisers, millions of dollars in campaign contributions and speaking fees, and financial support for the family foundation s charitable programs. By now, there should be little doubt that the Clinton political machine is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Wall Street banking cartel. Their relationship was built over three decades.The real watershed moment came here  BLANK CHECK: Bill Clinton laughs with Wall Street elites after signing the Financial Services Modernization Act in 1999. Key to the Kingdom In one of the most significant financial rulings in the modern era, the Clinton presidency gave big banks like Goldman Sachs the skeleton key to the kingdom by deregulating the investment banking system almost entirely.The Clinton/Goldman Sachs/Wall Street partnership was fully forged after the removal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which banking luminaries cynically named the  Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999  officially titled the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.  The original Glass-Steagall was a depression-age four-part provision under the Bank Act of 1933 that strictly prohibited securities activities that could be harmful to investors   the same sort of rogue speculating and paper fiat fraud which triggered the Great Depression (1929-1941). In fact, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which repealed Glass-Steagall, opened the door for the  shadow banking  realm outside of regulatory oversight which led to a much higher trading risk, as banks became more interlinked.Simply put: Clinton s repeal of Glass-Steagell removed the firewall between speculative investment banking and regular high street retail and consumer banking   which exposed everyone to toxic, subprime ponzi schemes and fake paper products being pushed around the globe by the banking elite   which ultimately caused the global economy to crash in 2008. All that can be laid at the feet of one William Jefferson Clinton. And Hillary still claims that,  My husband did so well with the economy.  Really?In a cross-posted article featured at Huffington Post, Nomi Prins underscored the complicit nature of Wall Street and Washington after the removal of tighter bank regulations under the Clinton administration during the 1990 s: To grasp the dangers that the Big Six banks (JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley) presently pose to the financial stability of our nation and the world, you need to understand their history in Washington, starting with the Clinton years of the 1990s. Alliances established then (not exclusively with Democrats, since bankers are bipartisan by nature) enabled these firms to become as politically powerful as they are today and to exert that power over an unprecedented amount of capital. Rest assured of one thing: their past and present CEOs will prove as critical in backing a Hillary Clinton presidency as they were in enabling her husband s years in office. Prins herself was a former managing director at Goldman Sachs, senior managing director at Bear Stearns, as well as having worked as a senior strategist at the now defunct investment banking firm Lehman Brothers. Following the financial crash in 2007-2008, Prins blew the whistle on the banking world in a book entitled  It Takes a Pillage: Behind the Bonuses, Bailouts, and Backroom Deals from Washington to Wall Street.  Prins has become an advocate for the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall Act since departing from the investment banking world.The media outlet Common Dreams described the merger between Citicorp and Travelers Group (becoming Citigroup), which was dubbed the  Citi-Travelers Act  on Capitol Hill. It was a conglomeration that went hand in hand with the Clinton administration s influence on banking deregulation marked by the repeal of Glass-Steagall: Then, in 1998, in an act of corporate civil disobedience, Citicorp and Travelers Group announced they were merging. Such a combination of banking and insurance companies was illegal under the Bank Holding Company Act, but was excused due to a loophole that provided a two-year review period of proposed mergers. The merger was premised on the expectation that Glass-Steagall would be repealed. Citigroup s co-chairs Sandy Weill and John Reed led a swarm of industry executives and lobbyists who trammeled the halls of Congress to make sure a deal was cut. At the time, it was the largest financial merger even though it was technically illegal, as stated by the former Bankers of America CEO Kenneth Guenther. In 1999, after 12 attempts in 25 years,  Congress passed the Financial Services Modernization Act, which led to the repeal of Glass-Steagall.The repeal of Glass-Steagall was pushed heavily by Citigroup s co-CEO Sanford Weill and lobbyist Roger Levy and according to a report by The Nation: They laid out more than $290 million for lobbying in 1998, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, and donated more than $150 million in the 1997 98 election cycle a figure sure to be topped in 1999 2000. How much of those contributions made their way to the Clinton family and what kind of impact did this have after they left the White House?In 2005, Bill Clinton was paid over half a million for speaking at three private Goldman events.In 2013, after stepping down from her position as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton gave a total of three paid speeches at Goldman Sachs events to the tune of $675,000 dollars, in which one attendee said she sounded more like a Goldman Sachs managing director,  according to a quote obtained by Politico. Indeed, Clinton gave a glowing speech to the Goldman gang and in the process, as Wikileaks released in early October, the Democratic nominee believes in  both a public and a private position  on Wall Street reform and that it is an  oversimplification  to suggest that investment banking led to the most recent financial crisis.That Clinton leak provided another window into the much protected alliance between finance and politics, but it s only the tip of a much larger iceberg.In 2015, the Washington Post reported that  Hillary Rodham Clinton and former president Bill Clinton earned in excess of $25 million for delivering 104 speeches since the beginning of 2014, a huge infusion to their net worth as she was readying for a presidential bid.   ANOINTED : Chelsea Clinton with Goldman Sachs-backed hedge funder Marc Mezvinsky.The Clinton family is chock-full of banking connections, as Chelsea Clinton  joined the Avenue Capital Group, which according to reports is a $12 billion hedge fund whose founder has contributed to many Democratic Party campaigns.  Chelsea is married to Marc Mezvinsky, a former investment banker for Goldman Sachs. Chelsea s tenure at Avenue Capital Group was from 2006-2008 just prior to Hillary Clinton s run for president in 2008. Since then Chelsea has risen to vice chairman inside the Clinton Foundation.Marc Mezvinsky was forced to close one of his hedge funds recently, Eaglevale Hellenic Opportunity, after had the fund lost most of its initial investor funds of $25 million   after blowing the money on secondhand junk Greek bank stocks and toxic government debt.The apple doesn t fall far from the tree  As it turns out, Marc is the son of troubled former Congressman Ed Mezvinsky   another close friend of Team Clinton.Politico reports on one of Ed Mezvinsky s financial controversies in 1999:  In the waning days of Clinton s presidency, federal prosecutors and the FBI were bearing down on former Rep. Ed Mezvinsky (D-Iowa), who had fallen for a series of Ponzi schemes and pulled in nearly $10 million money from other investors to cover his losses. Continuing, Politico outlined new information concerning a pardon request sent by from Ed Mezvinsky s wife to then President Bill Clinton: records released last week by the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock and obtained by POLITICO show Mezvinsky and his then-wife   ex-Rep. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky (D-Pa.)   pleaded with the former president for a presidential pardon to head off the looming federal case. In 2016, the Daily Mail reported the following: Chelsea Clinton s husband and his partners have suffered a huge loss after trying to bet on the revival of the Greek economy, and are now being forced to shut down one of their hedge funds.Marc Mezvinsky, 38, and his partners, former Goldman Sachs colleagues Bennett Grau and Mark Mallon, raised $25million from investors to buy up bank stocks and debt from the struggling nation.That fund however has lost 90 percent of its value, investors with direct knowledge of the situation told The New York Times, and will now be closed.

(Image Source: ilovemyfreedom)The NY Times further outlined the long-held Clinton/Goldman connection just two years before the 2007-2008 financial crisis: The Clintons  relationships with Wall Street deepened in the 2000s, when Mr. Clinton set up his foundation in Harlem and Mrs. Clinton was elected to the Senate from New York. That brought her in close touch with the big Wall Street firms, a source of jobs and tax revenue for New York   and a leading source of campaign funds for Mrs. Clinton. During her years in Congress, employees of Goldman donated in excess of $234,000 to Mrs. Clinton, more than those of any other company except Citigroup, accordingto the Center for Responsive Politics.Along with other New York politicians, Mrs. Clinton worked to obtain federal tax breaks to resuscitate Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and those breaks helped Goldman build its new, roughly $2 billion headquarters. When it broke ground in 2005, Mrs. Clinton and other New York officials were on-site. HOW TO MONETIZE INFLUENCE    Lloyd Blankfein at a Clinton Global Initiative event with Hillary Clinton. (Image Source: sputniknews)The Wall Street RacketTo understand who powers the Clinton Foundation s billion dollar RICO influence-peddling slush fund, you need to understand how money is laundered between Wall Street and Washington DC.Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Citigroup and many others were all ordered to pay millions for misleading investors after the 2008 crash, then in April of 2016, Goldman was ordered to settle a federal and state probe for $5 Billion dollars. CNBC reported the following: Goldman Sachs will pay $5 billion to settle federal and state probes into the bank s sale of mortgage-backed securities before the financial crisis, the Justice Department announced Monday.Authorities said Goldman misrepresented the quality of loans it securitized and then sold to investors ahead of the housing bubble and 2008 crisis. The settlement includes a $2.4 billion civil penalty, $1.8 billion in relief payouts to underwater homeowners and affected borrowers and $875 million to resolve various other claims.This resolution holds Goldman Sachs accountable for its serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages, when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail,  acting Associate Attorney General Stuart Delery said in a statement. In 2013, a Bloomberg article questioned how Goldman managed to survive and even thrive during the 2007-2008 economic crisis: Whether Goldman could have gone the way of Lehman Brothers or Merrill Lynch remains the subject of much debate. Goldman maintains that it did not need, or want, the $10 billion bailout that Hank Paulson [ former Goldman alum] pushed on it and other firms in October 2008. But the fact remains that when the Federal Reserve allowed Goldman and Morgan Stanley but not Lehman Brothers to become bank holding companies on Sept. 21, 2008, Goldman was able, three days later, to raise $10 billion in equity, $5 billion from the public and another $5 billion from investor Warren Buffett. That would probably not have happened without the Fed s expedited decision and support. (A week later, Morgan Stanley saved itself from bankruptcy when it negotiated a $9 billion equity investment from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.) All told the Clinton friendly investment giant Goldman Sachs (after making record profits) became the fifth mega-bank ordered to pay billions to the Department of Justice after the financial crash of 2007-2008. In addition, the firm was ordered to pay $3 billion to the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2014   not including pending private lawsuits levied on the firm since the Great Recession.In a New York Review article Goldman Sachs was already under investigation for committing fraud at least a year before the economic crash in 2007-2008: Data gathered mostly from the Corporate Research Project, a public interest website, show that on thirteen occasions between 2009 and 2016, Goldman was penalized by US courts or government agencies for fraudulent or deceptive practices that were committed mostly between 2006 and 2009.   CASHING OUT    Bill Clinton with his top economic strategist Robert Rubin. (Image Source: St. Louis Post-Dispatch)Wall Street Selects  Team Clinton The Clinton connection to Goldman Sachs emerged in the early 1990 s as Robert Rubin, a former senior partner with Goldman (with a 26-year tenure with the firm), joined former President Clinton s economic policy team, later becoming Secretary of the Treasury in 1995. Around that time, the Clinton presidency ushered in soaring tax hikes under the  Rubinomics  banner (aka Clintonomics), the plan raised taxes on most Americans, specifically the middle class, in what was said to be the largest increase in American history at the time.According to Congressional record (Vol.146 part 2),  In 1995, the economy grew at a sickly 1.5%   Clinton s vetoes of spending cuts [insured] continued deficits well into the 21st Century. In a Multinational Monitor report entitled  Wall Street s Best Investment: Ten Deregulatory Steps to Financial Meltdown, by Robert Weissman and James Donahue, a clearer picture of the financial collusion spawned in the 1990 s under the Clinton administration was revealed: During the Clinton Administration, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who had run Goldman Sachs, enthusiastically promoted the legislation. In a 1995 testimony before the House Banking Committee, for example, Rubin argued that  the banking industry is fundamentally different from what it was two decades ago, let alone in 1933.   U.S. banks generally engage in a broader range of securities activities abroad than is permitted domestically. Even domestically, the separation of investment banking and commercial banking envisioned by Glass-Steagall has eroded significantly. With a pedigree that included Goldman Sachs, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), The Brookings Institution and the Bilderberg Group, Robert Rubin emerged in 1999 as the vice chairman at Citigroup (1999-2009) after overseeing its merger as well as helping to craft the repeal of Glass-Steagall while serving as Secretary of Treasury. Rubin made a fortune with Citigroup causing sharp criticism in media and from those within the financial sector following the 2007-2008 crash. Here s a passage from Bloomberg regarding Rubin in the aftermath of the banking collapse: When it collapsed, due in part to bank-friendly policies that Rubin advocated, he made more than $100 million while others lost everything.  You have to view people in a fair light,  says Phil Angelides, co-chair of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, who credits Rubin for much of the Clinton-era prosperity.  But on the other side of the ledger are key acts, such as the deregulation of derivatives, or stopping the Commodities Futures Trading Commission from regulating derivatives, that in the end weakened our financial system and exposed us to the risk of financial disaster.   SWORN    FBI director James Comey sworn in by former DOJ head Eric Holder. (Image Source: thewhitehousespin)Under the MicroscopeOver the summer 21WIRE observed some curious connections between the Clinton Foundation and FBI director James Comey, as well as his questionable handling of other cases related to the Clinton family. Here s the following passage to consider in light of the new information related to the Clinton investigation: Many will also be unaware that before Comey was installed by the Obama Administration as FBI Director, he was on the board of Director at HSBC Bank   a bank implicated in international money laundering, including the laundering of billions on behalf of international drugs and narcotics trafficking cartels.Forbes also points out where Comey was also at the key choke-point during the case involving dodgy auditor KPMG which followed on by the HSBC criminal case: If Comey, and his boss Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez, had made a different decision about KPMG back in 2005, KPMG would not have been around to miss all the illegal acts HSBC and Standard Chartered SCBFF +% were committing on its watch. Bloomberg reported in 2007 that back in June of 2005, Comey was the man thrust into the position of deciding whether KPMG would live or die for its criminal tax shelter violations. In 2015, the Guardian discussed the financial relationship between HSBC and the Clinton Foundation receiving a startling $81 million in donations from clients of the large bank: The charitable foundation run by Hillary Clinton and her family has received as much as $81m from wealthy international donors who were clients of HSBC s controversial Swiss bank.Leaked files from HSBC s Swiss banking division reveal the identities of seven donors to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation with accounts in Geneva. A new update on the FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation was announced over the last 24 hours, in addition the recently reopened Clinton email probe from last week. It remains to be seen how in-depth this new investigation will be.To call it collusion would be an understatement. When looking back at the financial affairs of the Clintons, Goldman Sachs and others on Wall Street   it s clearer than ever that what we are looking at is a criminal syndicate.READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"November 3, 2016"

23193,OBAMACARE: Your Dog Might Have Better Healthcare Than You Do,"Simon Black Sovereign ManBelow is a short email that my friend Sam posted this morning to his Facebook page about his surprisingly positive experience with the US healthcare system.I thought it a fantastic read, and I wanted to pass it along to you:I had to run to the emergency room today for what may be a neurological issue. Dizziness, staggering, loss of balance, that kind of thing.I m in San Diego, one of the most expensive cities in the world, and I have no insurance. I figured I was screwed.But instead, the experience was unreal.I got seen immediately. I didn t even have time to sit down, they just whisked me into an examination room.The doctor and nurse were ON IT, and they took their time with the exam and consultation.The visit ultimately involved staying the whole day for observation, all kinds of tests, sedation and reversal, blood pressure check, a full blood panel work up (results tomorrow, yes TOMORROW keep your fingers crossed) and having both ears cleaned and flushed.The bill was a mere $374.63.Do I have some insane insurance plan? Nope.Am I being super-subsidized by the rest of America? Nope.Am I a privileged politician with a special  bosses only  healthcare plan? Don t make me laugh.It turns out that the care was for my dog, not for me. And we didn t go to a  people  hospital  I obviously took my dog to an animal hospital.She and I are both biological machines, mammals made mostly of water (though she sheds more than I do).The only other real difference is that the government is regulating the hell out of healthcare for people, while (relatively speaking), leaving healthcare for animals alone.And that, my friends, is the reason Obamacare has flopped, and why your healthcare costs will keep going up.It s not greed. It s not the drug companies. It s not anything other than the application of government intervention in what should be a free market.Simon again.It s not exactly controversial these days to suggest that the US healthcare system is in bad shape.According to data collected by numerous independent agencies like the Institute of Medicine, Commonwealth Fund, and Kaiser Family Foundation, the US still ranks dead last among advanced economies in overall quality of its healthcare system.In fact, the US healthcare system has the worst record in the number of deaths caused by mistakes or inefficient care.And wait times in the US for urgent care and primary care visits rank lower than every other developed nation.Americans pay at least 50% more for healthcare in terms of annual spending than people in other advanced nations, yet they receive less care as measured by the number of doctor visits.Sure, it s great that there are fewer uninsured people than ever before in the US, but this is a measure of QUANTITY, not a measure of QUALITY.Undoubtedly the US is home to some of the finest medical professionals in the world.But they ve been buried under an expensive, over-regulated bureaucracy that continues to erode overall quality in the system.A 2015 report from the National Academy of Sciences summed it up by stating,  For Americans, health care costs and expenditures are the highest in the world, yet health outcomes and care quality are below average by many measures. But instead of trying to understand WHY the system is so slow, bureaucratic, and expensive to begin with, politicians try to  fix  it by creating more regulations Continue this story at Sovereign ManREAD MORE OBAMACARE NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Obamacare Files",Middle-east,"November 2, 2016"
23194,Hillary’s ‘Russian Hack’ Hoax: The Biggest Lie of This Election Season," Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireThe longer this soap opera drags on, it s becoming more and more evident that the Russian government did not  hack  into the DNC, and Moscow is not feeding John Podesta s emails to Wikileaks. For those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory, however, this might be a hard pill to swallow. The White House and the Hillary Clinton campaign are now married to the idea that  Putin is hacking the US elections.  In response, the President is weighing his options   tougher economic sanctions, revoking diplomatic status to Russian envoys in the US, or even deploying his newly developed malicious cyber-activity  tools.Even VP Joe Biden wants in on the action, threatening Moscow by saying, We re sending a message. We have the capacity to do it.   Presumably, he s referring to a cyber  counter attack  by Washington.It seems that where ever you turn nowadays, someone in Washington is issuing a threat against Russia. Are US-Russian relations really that bad, or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the US?What was previously a stance reserved for right-wing neoconservative hawks and Cold War hold-outs has now infected America s left-wing, and is a firm plank in the Democratic Party platform, as evidenced by Hillary Clinton s constant anti-Russian rhetoric throughout this 2016 election cycle. Along with the White House, Clinton has now transformed the Democrats into the vanguard of Washington s new anti-Russia movement.On July 27th, Josh Rogin from the Washington Post wrote,  The Clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on Russia. After Trump suggested Wednesday that if Russia had indeed hacked Clinton s private email server it should release the emails, the Clinton campaign sent out its Democratic surrogates to bash Russia and Trump in a manner traditionally reserved for Republicans. Anyone who was paying attention back then knew this  Russian hack  talking point was purely political, but then again, who s really paying attention these days? Certainly not the US media.You can trace the genesis of the Democratic Party s hardcore anti-Russian strategy back to when President Vladimir Putin made a mild passing remark about Donald Trump s GOP primary success. From that point on, Trump s political opponents saw this as an open target. In their words,  comparing one dictator to another. Never one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points, President Obama got in on the act, intensifying the Trump-Putin narrative to the level of bromance.  If you ve made a career out of idealizing Ronald Reagan, then where were you when your own party s nominee for president was kissing up to Vladimir Putin?  said Obama on Oct 20th at a Clinton rally in Miami.Backed by the Obama White House, Clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming Russia   not only for the controversial DNC leaks, but also for hacking into US election systems in Arizona   a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation. The media s coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset. In a leading news release, entitled,  Russian hackers targeted Arizona election system,  we can see how after the cock-sure headline, the first paragraph would always sound definitive: Hackers targeted voter registration systems in Illinois and Arizona, and the FBI alerted Arizona officials in June that Russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state. But then by the time you advanced down the story, the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty: The bureau described the threat as  credible  and significant,  an eight on a scale of one to 10,  Matt Roberts, a spokesman for Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan (R), said Monday. As a result, Reagan shut down the state s voter registration system for nearly a week. And then, down to almost nothing It turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system. They had, however, stolen the username and password of a single election official in Gila County. At no point was any evidence ever given. Only ambiguous statements like,  Cyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a Russian government-directed hack. Are American politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their short-term political ambitions? Better yet, has American political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac (translated in French:  bottom of the bag ) where politicians in power are so insecure as to make-up and propagate wild international conspiracy theories   in the middle a national election cycle? It s a very depressing prospect, and yet, this is exactly what we are seeing in this 2016 Presidential Election.Behind Clinton s wild hyperbolic rants about the Kremlin and Wikileaks, you will find the White House On October 7th, the Obama Administration formally accused the Russian government of stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee and other high-profile individuals including Hillary Clinton s campaign manager John Podesta   giving them to Wikileaks. Soon, there was a queue of  national security  politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon. Senator Ben Sasse (NE-R), a member of the Homeland Security Committee spouted out,  Russia must face serious consequences. Moscow orchestrated these hacks because [Russian President Vladimir] Putin believes Soviet-style aggression is worth it. The United States must upend Putin s calculus with a strong diplomatic, political,  cyber and economic response. According to a Washington Post report by technology editor, Ellen Nakashima, the only  evidence  that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged  Russian government hacks    provided by a US cyber security company called Crowdstrike. No actual specifics are given, so we are meant to take private firm Crowdstrike s word for it.IMAGE: Crowdstrike cyber security.The Post s Nakashima then added: The administration also blamed Moscow for the hack of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of Democratic lawmakers. An online persona calling himself Guccifer 2.0 has claimed responsibility for posting the material. Those sites and that persona are  consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,  the joint statement said.   We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities. Moscow s press secretary s reply:  This is some sort of nonsense,  said Dmitry Peskov.Despite the constant repetition by Democrat media surrogates, and as CNN s Maria Cardona said last night, no US national intelligence agency has really  confirmed  that Russia was behind the email hacks   and still no evidence, other than speculative guesswork, has been presented.Likewise, US intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that  Russia did it,  thus, leaving the door open to walk-back the accusation at a later date. Standard Washington procedure of ambiguity. This little detail doesn t seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though. It seems that the White House, Hillary Clinton and media operatives like Cardona   are quite happy living in what John Kerry recent dubbed as a parallel universe. The announcement, albeit vague, actually originated from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.Still, during the final Presidential debate, Hillary Clinton proudly crowed how  17 US intelligence agencies  aka the  Intelligence Community    all agreed that Russia did it. We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election,  said Clinton.  I find that deeply disturbing. What s even more disturbing is the fact that Clinton is lying in front of a national audience. The highest levels of the Kremlin? Here are Clinton s 17 agencies :Air Force Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Coast Guard Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, State Department, Treasury Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Marine Corps Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency, Navy Intelligence and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.What does the Coast Guard Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency or the Drug Enforcement Administration know about John Podesta s emails? Answer: nothing.The exact same thing happened following Wikileaks first trove of DNC emails back in July 2016. The US government issued a vague accusatory statement, but would not actually name the culprit. Some might call that propaganda.In both instances, the Obama Administration refused to present any evidence. Translated: there was no evidence. If there had been, the White House would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the UN over Washington s  flagging efforts in Syria. Both Obama Administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for Democrats and  journalists  working for hopelessly partisan outlets like New York Times and CNN  none of whom have bothered to press the White House for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the Party s decree that Russia is hacking the US election process. If you actually look at the joint DNI-DHS statement issued on the matter, it contains no definitive statement:  [the hacks] are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow   the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities. According to NSA intelligence worker-turned whistleblower William Binney, when asked about WikiLeaks and whether the Russians are  hacking US elections, he concluded that the cyber efforts against the DNC were more likely to be the work of a disgruntled U.S. intelligence worker. Under partisan pressure from senior Democrat Senator Harry Reid, the FBI also initiated another investigation into  people linked to the Trump team with Russia.  Reid was unset about the DNC hacks and the Podesta emails and demanded the FBI do something about the Trump campaign. To date, the FBI haven t come up with anything.To be fair, Hillary would have every reason to believe that the Kremlin is behind the hack   because her staff read it to her from the campaign s daily intelligence briefings, presumably, supplied from the US government s much vaunted Intelligence Community. Of course, that s the same Intelligence Community that briefed George W Bush about Saddam s nonexistent nuclear weapons program, and who also briefed Colin Powell about Iraq s imaginary  Winnebagos of Death  aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior double-wide camper vans. So, of course, they would know if Putin directed the DNC leaks and Podesta email hacks.For those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as  Washington Intelligence,  I can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now,  No, that was Iraq, that was Bush. We re not like that. No, this time it s different. This time we are sure the Russians did it!  In 2014, Obama claimed that Kim s notorious  Bureau 121  hacked into Sony Pictures. This isn t the first time that President Obama has cried wolf on a foreign  hack  and then tried to sell it for political purposes. Back in December 2014, Obama claimed that North Korea had hacked Sony Pictures in Hollywood. Pentagon-CIA media proxy CNN quickly chimed in to support Washington s conspiracy theory, floating a colorful story that Kim Jing-Un had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called  Bureau 121.  Just like with today s  Russian Hack  theory, no member of the mainstream press dared to question the White House s ridiculous North Korean claim, and like the  Russian Hack  claims, the only source cited for Sony hack was analysis provided by US firm Crowdstrike.Jumping the SharkAfter their Democratic Party Convention on July 27th, the Clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their Putin narrative.Soon after, a cadre of top Clinton national security surrogates then accused Trump of emboldening Russia in their evil plot to  destabilize and dominate the West.   Tom Donilon, a former national security adviser then accused Russia of interfering  with elections all over Europe and then accused Trump is helping Russia directly. At that point, they were in too deep to turn back.The biggest impact of @wikileaks? Shining a spotlight on Russia s attempt to undermine American democracy and Trump s refusal to condemn it https://t.co/ALzpYm1Bb5  Josh Schwerin (@JoshSchwerin) October 21, 2016Clinton spin doctors Josh Schwerin and Michael Fallon would stoop even lower by accusing RT of having possession of the Podesta emails even before Wikileaks did. Their only evidence  seemed to be Twitter posts by RT News which Clinton held up as  proof  that the Kremlin was front-running Wikileaks email dumps. The Clinton braintrust failed to note that the Podesta emails were posted on Wikileaks own website well before RT News had tweeted about them. At that point it became obvious that the Clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on. We then watched, as one RT reporter after another dismantled the Clinton campaign s desperate claims. It was embarrassing.They could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was WikiLeaks head Julian Assange who chose the timing of the release of the DNC and Podesta emails. Rather than attack Assange himself, who happens to be popular with millennials (the very group Clinton struggles to connect with), her operatives opted to target Russia and Trump instead.Either way, the political strategy here is clear  to shoot the messenger. The Clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rear-guard mode, because based on the content of both the DNC Leaks, Wikileaks files, and Project Veritas video   their own Democratic Party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization.Their other big problem is that despite all the outrage from Democrats and their mainstream media surrogates, none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity. The results speak for themselves. The initial DNC leak of 20,000 emails resulted in the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. They revealed the unthinkable: the Democratic National Committee actively worked to undermine the Presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders in favor of the establishment choice in Hillary Clinton. Sanders never had a chance. Honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process, while party insiders and Clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened.To prove this point, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton then gave Wasserman-Schultz a glowing endorsement on the way out. For the last eight years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back. This afternoon, I called her to let her know that I am grateful,  said Obama. Not surprisingly, Clinton thanked Wasserman Schultz, presumably for helping to knock her only competitor Sanders out of the Democrat primary race.  I am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year s historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week s events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership,  said Clinton.The party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it.Party MeltdownWasserman Schultz s replacement didn t fair much better. DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election, but Brazile was soon skewered by subsequent Wikileaks batches   showing how, on more than one occasion, she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives   straight to Hillary Clinton. A March 12 email exchange shows Brazile stating that she received a town hall question from Roland Martin, a TV One host who co-moderated a March 13 town hall with CNN s Jake Tapper. A March 5 email shows that she shared a question with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and communications director Jennifer Palmieri that was to be asked in a March 6 debate hosted by CNN in Flint, Mich.  (Source: Daily Caller)Brazile s audacious fraud also helped contribute to her party s planned sabotage of Democrat challenger Bernie Sanders. Watch Brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here: In addition, it was also revealed how CNN s head political commentator, Gloria Borger, was named by Podesta as one of a shortlist of  journalists  the Clinton campaign would  work with  to gain favorable coverage. You d think that CNN would have dropped Borger after this was revealed, but no. Amazingly, Borger is still leading CNN s election coverage.Clearly, CNN cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.Ever-unbiased CNN's Gloria Borger refers to being in ""GOP hell"" and says she'll ""reach out soon"" to Podesta. Heart-warming #PodestaEmails13 pic.twitter.com/CQFdcJ12Q5  400-lb Hacker Owens (@NubianAwakening) October 21, 2016Worse Than WatergatePerhaps a bigger scandal which the Obama White House and Clinton campaign operatives would like to bury   is the FBI s investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the FBI and the Justice Department, over whether or not to pursue an investigation into Clinton issue: Some investigators grew frustrated, viewing FBI leadership as uninterested in probing the charity, these people said. Others involved disagreed sharply, defending FBI bosses and saying Mr. McCabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the Justice Department and FBI agents pursuing the Clinton Foundation case. It isn t unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited. But the internal debates about the Clinton Foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president. There s more. It was also revealed last week how Jill McCabe, the wife of FBI Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe, received $467,500 in campaign funds in late 2015 for her Virginia State Senate run. This unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by Virginia Gov.Terry McAuliffe   a Clinton Foundation board member. After the funds were donated, Andrew McCabe was then put in charge of the Clinton Email case. In normal times, this one scandal would be bigger than Watergate, but these are not normal times.So why is Washington going all out to deflect to Russia, and cover-up the Clinton scandals, and the Wikileaks document dumps? One reason is because the Clinton email issue goes all the way to the top   to the President himself.What 21WIRE reported on Oct 21st is how President Obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of Hillary s unauthorized private server. Obama told CBS News on March 7, 2015 that he only found out about Clinton s server  the same time everybody else learned it through news reports.  The President s lie was confirmed when newly released FBI documents showed that: Obama used a pseudonym [bobama@ameritech.net] when communicating with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by email, and at least one of those emails ended up on Clinton s private email server. So, not only did Obama lie on national TV, but he also broke strict White House security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails  off grid  with Hillary Clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server    maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system. Who knows why he did it.Sure, he s not the first US President to lie, but like, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, Obama just joined that exclusive liars club   caught out lying to the American people.On top of this, any communications made by the President of the United States are de facto labeled as  born classified.   The same goes for any State Department communications with other foreign ministers. COVER-UP: John Podesta and Huma Abedin on the Hillary campaign jet (Image: ABC News)It should be well known by now after watching both Attorney Generals Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch in action   that the Obama Justice Department (DOJ) is one of the most politicized in history. Bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the Hillary Email case.On Friday, FBI Director James Comey set the election alight after announcing that the FBI would be reopening the Clinton email case   currently examining 650,000 emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former US Congressman Anthony Weiner (estranged husband of top Clinton aid and long-time confidant Huma Abedin) who was snared in a  sexting  scandal, allegedly involving a underaged female. So which DOJ person is in charge of this investigation? None other than Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik. Who is Kadzik?  Zero Hedge reports: Oh yes. Recall our post from last week,  Clinton Campaign Chair Had Dinner With Top DOJ Official One Day After Hillary s Benghazi Hearing  in which we reported that John Podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked DOJ officials the very day after Hillary Clinton s Benghazi testimony? It was Peter Kadzik. Oh, and if that wasn t good enough, Kadzik was also Podesta s lawyer back in 1998 when Ken Starr was investigating Podesta over his role in helping Bill Clinton intern/mistress Monica Lewinsky land a job at the United Nations. The two were described as  best friends. FOX News confirms: Fantastic lawyer. Kept me out of jail,  Podesta wrote on Sept. 8, 2008 to Obama aide Cassandra Butts, according to emails hacked from Podesta s Gmail account and posted by WikiLeaks.To call the Clinton circle incestuous would be an understatement, and on the whole, Americans are sick of it.Russia   The Party ScapegoatFormer Democratic Party leader Howard Dean was so incensed about the FBI reopening the case, he accused the FBI director of being in league with Russia, Tweeting:  Ironically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin. Ironically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin.  Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) October 29, 2016Another veteran party operative and lifetime Clinton defender, James Carville, was so upset by the FBI announcement that he accused  the KGB  working with Republicans to  hijack the election  during his wild rant on MSNBC. I think this an outrage and I think the fact that the KGB is involved in this election is an outrage and I think the American people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for Comey. That s what I think,  said Carville.Maybe someone can remind Carville that there is no KGB, and that the Soviet Union actually dissolved in 1991.These are just a few scandals surrounding the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, along with the many expos s revealed through Wikileaks, and the Podesta email batches. Those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence   unlike the Russians hacking the DNC and John Podesta and passing those to Wikileaks. Suffice to say, the Democratic Party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning Wikileaks material, and also blame Donald Trump in the process. It should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised Hillary Clinton over the finish line on November 8th, the Washington establishment has concocted the story that  Putin is trying to influence our electoral process in the US.  They ve tried to lay this at the feet of Donald Trump, who Obama and Clinton claim has some secret special relationship with Vladimir Putin. The liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point, and anti-Russian war hawks on the Republican side love it too. For the White House and the Clinton campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep   a perfect double entendre.The geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold. First, this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for  sanctions against Russia. Secondly, the US could continue to lean on Russia in the UN over Syria. Previously, 21WIRE reported how Washington s State Dept and UN delegations, led by the dynamic trio of John Kerry, Samantha Power, and John Kirby, already lied when levelling charges against Russia for war crimes in Aleppo, and again while accusing Russia and Syria of conducting an airstrike on a UN Aid Convoy in Syria. As we have already shown   that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of US-backed  rebels  Al Nusra Front, or Nour al-Din al-Zenki.With so much at stake geopolitically, why would Washington lie about a potential World War III trigger event? If they are prepared to lie about this, what else are they prepared to lie about?The demonization of all things Russian has definitely accelerated since late 2013 when the US engineered a coup d etat in Kiev, Ukraine. Ever since that it s been a go-to talking point for ginning-up and new transaltlantic arms race, as with Republican war hawks   and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection, like Clinton and the Democrats. When the new year rang in 2015, the newly appointed head of the U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors, Andrew Lack, announced the new challenges facing America s own state-run media arm that includes U.S. overseas propaganda assets including Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Free Asia. Lack said,  We are facing a number of challenges from entities like Russia Today which is out there pushing a point of view, the Islamic State in the Middle East and groups like Boko Haram, He was forced to resign shortly after that.What s clear is that when it comes to all things Russian, there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this US Administration. The list is too long to chronicle here, although  Russian-backed Rebles Shootting Down MH17,  and  Assad Regime Sarin Attack in Damascus in 2013  certainly comes to mind.That said, it s hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the Russia government, a world nuclear power and member of the UNSC, of  Hacking Into the US Electoral Process.  When you examine history however, what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the US government and the CIA have altered and flipped 100 foreign elections throughout history, the attempted assassination of over 50 foreign leaders. Knowing all this, one might find it hard to take seriously Washington s claims that Putin and Trump are trying manipulate the 2016 ElectionOn Oct 9, 2016, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov laid it all on the table: We have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive Russophobia that now lies at the heart of U.S. policy towards Russia. It s not just a rhetorical Russophobia, but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security. Self-serving, career political operatives in Washington are playing a dangerous game. History will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the Obama-Clinton era.Knowing what we now know about the NSA and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone, anywhere   if Washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from, maybe they could start there. Far be it from anyone in Washington or the media to ever adopt that line of inquiry.Still, we re waiting for the emergence of an adult in the room in Washington   before it s too late.READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV ",Middle-east,"November 1, 2016"

23196,PARTY CORRUPTION: Clinton Campaign Directly Tied to Disgraced DNC Consultant,"21st Century Wire says A tidal wave of revelations is pouring out of the Clinton campaign as the 2016 presidential election draws to a close.   MELTDOWN    The Clinton campaign continues to unravel following a series of troubling details. (Photo illustration 21WIRE)Over the weekend, it was discovered through a Wikileaks email dump, that Neera Tanden of the Center for American Progress, John Podesta s top aide, had an email exchange with Michael Lux of Progressive Strategies revealing that the Democratic consultant Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners, was closely allied with Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook.  POLITICAL BOMBSHELL    Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook had close ties to disgraced DNC consultant Robert Creamer. (Image Source: Lockerdome)Creamer gained national attention when he became the subject of video sting operation captured by the investigative non-profit Project Veritas. Not only was it revealed that the Creamer discussed ways to commit voter fraud and violence at Donald Trump rallies on camera   he also met with White House officials some 342 times over the past year, including 47 private meetings with President Obama or other senior officials.  DNC SCANDAL    Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners and Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky. (Image Source: National Vanguard)Creamer s visits to the White House also included his wife, a 9-term Illinois Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky.White House visitor records have shown that Schakowsky took 47  private meetings with Obama or his senior staff, over the past year. The consultancy Democracy Partners appears to have applied Schakowsky as a political buffering point, in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level. The nature of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain high-ranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics, potentially giving the Clinton campaign and the DNC plausible deniability.The Mook fallout is the latest in a laundry list of problems for the Clinton campaign and comes at a time when interim DNC chair Donna Brazile, is embroiled in controversy of over leaked debate questions prior to at least two 2016 town hall debates. Brazile stepped down from her role at CNN earlier in October. Here s a passage from the Daily Caller describing the scenario: Donna Brazile, the interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, began providing town hall and debate questions to the Clinton campaign earlier than previously known, emails released by WikiLeaks on Monday show. The article continued by stating that the revelations expose that the interim DNC chair was more deeply involved than previously outlined: In the March 12 exchange, Brazile mentions [Roland] Martin by name and offers to provide more than just the one town hall question that she is known to have shared with the campaign. I ll send a few more. Though some questions Roland submitted,  Brazile wrote to Palmieri in the March 12 email thread, which is entitled From time to time I get the questions in advance. Martin, is a commentator for TV One and the host of News One Now, as well as a CNN contributor.In another matter, the Wall Street Journal revealed the following, while disclosing an apparently contentious relationship between the FBI and DOJ, while the FBI appears to be somewhat fractured over the latest email server case developments: The latest development began in early October when New York-based FBI officials notified Andrew McCabe [of the Terry McAuliffe campaign contribution scandal], the bureau s second-in-command, that while investigating Mr. Weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a teenage minor, they had recovered a laptop. Many of the 650,000 emails on the computer, they said, were from the accounts of Ms. Abedin, according to people familiar with the matter. Some critics have called for McCabe to recuse himself after it was revealed his wife received $675,000 from a well-known Clinton confidant, Terry McAuliffe. This was further underlined after the House Oversight Commitee wanted more information about the Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe and its ties to the Clintons.The alleged internal feud among agencies was compounded when Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates objected  to FBI Director James Comey reopening the Clinton email server case this past week   something that added to the Lynch/Clinton tarmac meeting before the first FBI ruling in the Clinton case.According to a report filed by Zero Hedge, a close friend of Podesta, Peter Kadzik, the Assistant Attorney General of the Department of Justice (DOJ), will be in charge of a probe into Huma Abedin, Clintion s closest aide.Interestingly, as a mountain of controversy envelops the Clinton campaign, the FBI is now conducting an early inquiry into former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, over his alleged foreign business connections.Back in August, the following business connection was revealed by NBC news: In 2008, according to court records, senior Trump aide Paul Manafort s firm was involved with a Ukrainian oligarch named Dmytro Firtash in a plan to redevelop a famous New York hotel, the Drake. The total value of the project was $850 million. Firtash s company planned to invest over $100 million, the records say.That same year, Firtash acknowledged to the U.S. ambassador in Ukraine that he got his start in business with the permission of a notorious Russian crime lord, according to a classified State Department cable. Other cables say Firtash made part of his fortune through sweetheart natural gas deals between Russia and the Ukraine. Although the US State Department has determined that Firtash may have ties to a criminal enterprise in Russia   so far, there s nothing directly linking Manafort to any underground element at this time.Watch this space   as the Russia/Trump meme fostered by mainstream media or some other politically polarizing element will look to deflect from the Clinton campaign meltdown.More from LifeZette below   OUT OF CONTROL?    Wikileaks reveals Robby Mook s links to DNC contractor who discussed ways to commit voter fraud and violence.

He was sending people to provoke Trump at events.Creamer has thus become a red-hot issue in the campaign. And now it s apparent he is close to Mook.

23197,"Hillary’s Secret Weapon: Evan McMullin is CIA-Goldman Sachs candidate, backed by Mitt Romney’s Wall Street Machine","J.R. Smith 21st Century WireMuch has been made by Democrat Hillary Clinton and the White House s accusation that Russia is trying to influence US elections,  although neither has presented any real evidence to back up this extraordinary claim. On the other hand, there is plenty of evidence documenting the CIA interfering and altering numerous foreign elections throughout history. This raises an interesting question: would the CIA ever try to interfere in an US election? Evan McMullin is a 40-year-old self-described conservative Mormon   and  former  CIA operative. I enjoyed being a grey man,  said McMullin of his 11 years in the CIA.On the wall in his Salt Lake City campaign offices is a poster which reads  007 for President. That s a bit worrying, if indeed McMullin fancies himself as a James Bond character, but in a way it really sums up what his presidential run is all about   working in the  grey  areas, in back room meetings with GOP establishment luminaries, colored by private and public deception. It s what the CIA has specialized in for decades; manipulating and perverting hundreds of overseas elections   all in the interest of transnational corporate elites (like Mitt Romney), and now it seems they have an inside man nested in another key position  Oddly, the media often introduces him as a  conservative columnist    seemingly in an effort to distract from his total insider pedigree. McMullin is no  newcomer  or fresh face   he is a career operative, inserted into special niches, including his most recent stint as Congressional director of GOP policy. Now he s come out of the shadows to play a key role in the US election   on behalf of some very powerful interests.According to Real Clear Politics, McMullin describes his work as a clandestine operative for the CIA in both Iraq and Afghanistan, in  all the war zones post-9/11 until 2010 and most of the other hostile environments . He admits his job was to  penetrate insurgent and terrorist groups as well as foreign governments , recruiting agents to pass information  to take these people off the battlefield   either capture or kill them. Interesting skill set,  penetrating  governments. We can safely assume that also entails subverting elections overseas, or maybe using Saudi Arabian cash to buy weapons for Jihadi terrorist  rebels  in Syria.Not surprisingly, McMullin trumpets a loud anti-Putin and anti-Assad rhetoric which is almost perfectly in synchronization with that of Hillary Clinton s. Like Clinton, McMullin relies on a campaign of fear set against Russia and Syria in an attempt to try to bracket Trump togther with other overseas leaders currently under a  demonization order  by the Washington DC establishment. Donald Trump is an authoritarian just like Vladimir Putin, just like Bashar Al-Assad, just like the Communist regime in China. I have worked against and around authoritarians overseas and I know them when I see them. Donald Trump is one of them. He would bring the same kind of economic stagnation, internal turmoil and discord to our country that other dictators bring to their own. I m sure the Kremlin considers Donald Trump by far its most successful intelligence operation ever. It s very clear that Vladimir Putin and his regime have some control over Donald Trump. Trump s support for Putin is the only thing he has been consistent on. The following is straight off of McMullin s campaign website, under the heading of,  America s Role in the World : Evan will impose tougher sanctions on Russia and increase America s military presence in the Baltics in order to deter and reverse Putin s aggression, rather than pretending that he is a partner for peace in Syria. Evan will stand up for the rights of American and allied ships to sail freely in international waters, rather than letting China dominate the Western Pacific. This statement could ve just as well have written by the CIA s office of forward information planning, or from the office of Hillary 2016, take your pick.The next line in his r sum  should also throw up a big red flag: he s also a former operative at Goldman Sachs investment bank. So, CIA and Goldman Sachs. Aside from bank-rolling Bill and Hillary Clinton s political machine for the better part of the last 15 years, Goldman also backed Mitt Romney s failed 2012 presidential run.The connections here between all of these establishment players is undeniable   with McMullin sitting comfortably in his CIA  grey  area.Stealing Utah for Hillary If we can send a strong message here from Utah, it will change the discussion in Washington and across this country,  said McMullin.This is the problem with the contrived McMullin campaign: it will not impact the national political discussion.Since he announced his candidacy three months ago on August 8, 2016, his  campaign  has only really existed inside Utah, but conveniently amplified by an US corporate mainstream media   and the very same media outlets that have been demonstrably pro-Clinton, anti-Sanders and anti-Trump since the very beginning of the presidential race.Evan McMullin s primary directive seems to be to steal Utah s 6 electoral votes away from Republican candidate Donald Trump   who is currently enjoying a comfortable lead over Hillary Clinton in Utah. Recent polls show Trump and McMullin running neck and neck in Utah, at 30% and 29% respectively. In an already tight national race between Trump and Clinton, those 6 electoral votes could easily decide the national election   in favor of Hillary Clinton.Aside from Utah, McMullin is also hoping to steal away Republic votes in key states with substantial Mormon populations like Arizona, Idaho, and Wyoming. McMullin is hoping to exploit Mormon voter blocks over the issue of Donald Trump s bolshy demeanor and alleged past sex scandals   a negative which will resonate with conservative Mormon voters in places like Utah.Based on the incredible amount of national media access he s being given across all of the top establishment broadcast TV networks, it s pretty clear that the McMullin campaign is being engineered at the highest levels. For a candidate who appeared from nowhere in the last two months, he s enjoyed carte blanche airtime, including softball interviews on Meet the Press with Chuck Todd, The Week with George Stephanopoulos, as well as primetime slots on pro-Clinton media outlets CNN, CBS, NBC, and of course, on Democratic Party channel MSNBC.Here s his debutant spot on Morning Joe, where McMullin waxes on about how,  George Bush kept this country safe after 9/11 , and other familiar platitudes: When McMullin speaks, you can almost hear the voice of Mitt Romney and the old GOP establishment. If the Republican Party can t make the changes, as wasn t able to do after 2012, the conservative movement will need a new political vehicle,  said McMullin to Stephanopoulos.From these sort of statements, we can see that the object of McMullin s campaign is the same as Romney s   to keep the Republican candidate from winning on November 8th.Establishment scion Mitt Romney (photo, left) and his Wall Street partners are desperate, and deathly frightened that if Donald Trump wins, he will build a new GOP power base   one which is not based on a tight elite Wall Street investment bank circle that uses men like Romney as their intermediary to control govemnent affairs and fix markets   but rather, real people power based on grassroots, working class and middle class voters.The other subtle piece of the McMullin deception is how he constantly spins in the mainstream media about how a Clinton victory is already a fait accompli. In other words:  Trump has already lost, so cast your vote for me as a protest vote against the winner, Hillary Clinton.  By applying that subtle spin, McMullin hopes to avoid being fingered as Mitt Romney s #NeverTrump tool.Getting on enough ballots in enough states requires money, and a political machine. Enter the Team Romney McMullin s ability to get on the ballot in 11 states, and also  write-in  access in 32 others, was financed and run by a 501c3 Not for Profit organization which, like McMullin, suddenly popped up this year. It s called,  Better For America,  said to be founded by GOP operatives John Kingston and Joel Searby.When asked whether or not he s backed by Mitt Romney, McMullin always says  no , but the facts say otherwise. Here we can see clearly that McMullin is a creation of Mitt Romney s so-called #NeverTrump Movement. McMullin s primary backer in this project appears to be Kingston, who just happens to be a former GOP delegate from Massachusetts and donor to former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, as well as executive producer for the 2014 documentary, Mitt.In addition, McMullin s running mate is former Mitt Romney campaign staffer, Mindy Finn. Aside from working in the Bush Administration, Finn also worked for Twitter and Google, specifically building their tech networks with the Washington Beltway. Another total insider.McMullin has also been working with former Mitt Romney campaign strategist Stuart Stevens.Behind the patriotic rhetoric in Better For America s marketing spin is well-financed, laser focused operation to steal Utah from the Republican party. In public, the organization claims that: We deserve better than two candidates that are deeply unfavorable among a majority of the people they claim to represent. Together, we can give a voice to the millions of Americans who cannot in good conscience vote for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. If a third party candidate emerges, they need to know the support they have on the ground among the nearly two-thirds of Americans said they are willing to support an independent candidate. Better For America s claim is disingenuous at best, if not outright deceptive, not least because there were already third, and fourth party candidates   Gary Johnson (Libertarian Party) and Jill Stein (Green Party), both of whom have been organizing in all 50 states. This casual ignorance of the other alternative candidates indicates an attempt to totally manipulate the electoral conversation.Very underhanded yes, but this is something a CIA operative would be doing overseas thrawrting elections and destablizing fledgling democracies in target nations. Romney and Goldman Sachs End GameBeyond engineering a narrow victory for Hillary Clinton, Mitt Romney and the #NeverTrump conclave s last option is to steal the election after Nov 8th. It goes like this .Their final play would be if neither Trump nor Clinton receive the 270 electoral college votes required for an outright victory   which would then send the election to the House of Representatives. This hasn t happened since 1825. At this point a Republican House of Representatives (many of whom are #NeverTrump supporters) would choose any of the top three candidates who had won a state. If McMullin wins Utah, then he would theoretically be in with a chance. But not as good a chance as Hillary Clinton would.Regardless, either scenario (although the Clinton scenario is more real) is predicated on Evan McMullin s role as a spoiler. McMullin admits this openly: It depends on the race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump being very, very close and it is not close now. For Clinton friends and campaign backers like Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and fellow Wall Street elites, a Donald Trump victory could mean an interruption in profits   slowing down the financial organized crime and fiat paper fraud which has enriched them and the Clintons (and soon the Obamas too) ever since Bill Clinton gave Goldman and Co. the ultimate blank check when the outgoing US President repealed the Glass Steagall Act in 1999. With that one stroke of the pen, the Clintons set the stage for the 2008 Financial Collapse   and bailout recipient Blankfein and the Goldman syndicate (and Romney too) made vast fortunes off other people s misery. Notice that Goldman and Wall Street have been stuffing money into the Clinton s pockets ever since with speaking fees, jobs, investments, and also bank-rolling Chelsea Clinton s husband Mark Mezvinsky s hedge fund.Blankfein and his ilk brought the US economy to its knees, and were paid handsomely for their effort.It s an incestuous ring of financial skull-duggery   and you will not hear the righteous, self-styled  liberty  advocate Evan McMullin so much as mention any of this, let alone bad mouth his former employer and criminal financial institution   and yet, this is the real story that everyone should really be talking about this election   the seedy relationship between the likes of Goldman Sachs and the establishment s favored political candidates.READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV ",Middle-east,"October 31, 2016"
23198,‘The Process Has Begun’: FBI examine 650k emails on Clinton aide Abedin husband’s laptop,"21st Century WireAccording to reports, the FBI have obtained a warrant to examine newly discovered emails relating to possible classified material originating from Hillary Clinton s unauthorized private email server. The FBI will now pour through 650,000 emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former US Congressman Anthony Weiner (photo, left) who has been caught in a  sexting  scandal alleged to have involved an underaged girl. Weiner is estranged husband of top Clinton aid and long-time confidant Huma Abedin. The process has begun, said an FBI source to the New York Times.This comes after a Friday afternoon announcement by embattled FBI Director James Comey stating the agency intended to reopen the previously closed investigation into former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s long-running email scandal.21WIRE reported on Comey s shock announcement Friday, and also detailed a leaked  memo supplied to Fox News  indicating that there might be an internal upheaval within the FBI over botching the previous leg of the investigation and possibly caving into the political pressure from the White House and the DOJ to drop the case in order to preserve Hillary Clinton s presidential run.Since the FBI announcement, the Clinton campaign has gone into full damage control mode, while the Trump campaign has enjoyed a small surge which has cut into Clinton s lead across all national polls. All this happening less than 10 days before voters go to the polls on Nov 8th.Oddly, Clinton, a former lawyer, has publicly demanded that the FBI  release all the information, and let the public know exactly what they have,  even though this would be a violation of legal procedures in a criminal investigation.Nevada Senator Harry Reid (photo, left) issued an open letter/press release accusing director Comey of somehow being in violation of the Hatch Act by attempting to interfere with a US election, stating, I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act,  said Reid. Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law,  he added.Congressman Trey Gowdy (SC-R), the Chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, was the first to discover Clinton s illegal email server during the initial Benghazi hearings. According to Gowdy, this latest move by the FBI could net an indictment due to possible evidence of a cover-up. Gowdy s reponse on FOX News to Reid s letter was stunning: Thank God he s leaving (office), is my initial reaction. My second reaction is, I did not know Mormons used drugs. Anyone who is capable of sending out that press release has to be under the influence of something.

23199,Moore: Why Millions of Americans Are Voting Trump,"Brasscheck TVA lot of people are going to vote for Donald Trump in November. Tens of millions of them.

Ironically, Moore s film was meant to be a last-ditch pro-Clinton project, but as it turns out, this ultra-liberal enemy of Donald Trump delivered to best explanation for the Trump political phenomenon. Moore set out to make an anti-Trump film, but this clip accidentally went viral and has become a key rallying cry for the Trump Movement.

23201,"Ammon and Ryan Bundy Found ‘Not Guilty’ in Oregon Federal Case, Gov. Kate Brown Upset by Jury Decision","21st Century Wire Yesterday, Judge Anna Brown handed out  not guilty  verdicts to both Ammon and Ryan Bundy, leaders of the 41 day occupation of Malheur National Wildlife refuge near Burns, Oregon earlier this year.  The Bundys along with five other defendants, were acquitted of all major charges relating to the Oregon protest event, including  conspiring to impede refuge employees  and possession of firearms at a federal facility. Ammon Bundy led the protest in Oregon in January 2016.Ammon and Ryan Bundy are still being held in custody however, awaiting a second trial will they will face federal charges in the state of Nevada over the high-profile Bundy Ranch Standoff with the employees of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) near Bunkerville in April 2014.The Burns standoff came to an abrupt end after one protest spokesman and Arizona resident, Robert LaVoy Finicum (photo, left), died after police fired on protester vehicles, before a special federal tactical team tracked, shot and killed the rancher at a pre-planned ambush along a remote rural road outside of Burns.Not surprisingly, the surprise acquittal has sent Democratic Party-linked media outlets into a tail spin. The New York Times still labelled the the Bundy brothers as  Armed antigovernment protesters  indicating a hyperbolic editorial bias against the defendants which was visible through the trajectory of this story.Similarly, both Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and Harney County Sheriff David Ward are on record saying that were not happy with Friday s verdict, not surprisingly, as both these officials played a crucial role in the state s escalation of violence which colminated in Finicum s death. Brown even issued a public statement saying she was disappointed  the jury s decision.Despite a campaign of highly coordinated  trial by media  propaganda, led by the Oregonian Newspaper and other federal-leaning media outlets like the Washington Post, and ultra-liberal websites like Salon.com the jury was still able to judge the facts, and eventually ruled on the side of the protesters. I knew that what my husband was doing was right, but I was nervous because the judge was controlling the narrative,  said Angela Bundy, 39, wife of Ryan to a Times reporter.According to one juror, the verdict was a statement regarding the various failures of the prosecution  to prove that there was a conspiracy   indicating that the federal government s botched affair might have been down to over-zealous political atmosphere in Washington that led to proscecutors going for a completely over-the-top set of charges in order to make a political statment   instead of just sticking to the facts and Constiutional law.Police Tase Bundy Lawyer in CourtroomRight after the verdict was rendered, a bizarre courtroom scene erupted which ended in one of the Bundy s defense lawyers was tased and taken into custody after he asked the court to produce paperwork showing the order to rearrest  his client.

23202,FBI Director Comey’s ‘Leaked’ Memo Explains Why He’s Reopening the Clinton Email Case,"21st Century Wire says 21WIRE reported on Friday about the FBI s surprising announcement that it would be reopening the Clinton email case due to new evidence of  classified information  found on sex cheat Anthony Weiner s (newly estranged husband of Clinton chief aid Huma Abedin)  computer which was subject to a seperate investigation. Will this really yield anything significant in the 10 days running-up to the Nov 8th election, or is this just clever Democrat party smoke and mirrors? It seems that Washington s political tricksters have already sprung into action After Comey s shock announcement, a leaked  memo appeared out of nowhere, supplied to Fox News, in which Comey and the FBI seem to be going through a routine set of prescribed political moves designed to implement damage control. ELITE CIRCLES: FBI head James Comey and friend Hillary Clinton.Certainly, a desperate Democratic Party, and an even more desperate Obama White House (over the last 3 weeks, Obama and his wife Michelle have been out campaigning more that Hillary Clinton herself), could be pressuring or nudging the FBI on this volatile issue which could easily tilt a close presidential race against Donald Trump. Aside from the obvious potential of another Clinton scandal, yesterday s FBI move could also be a prelude to the following possible scenarios:NOTE: Despite calls from the Clinton camp for FBI to disclose what they have (which they cannot by law anyway, you d think Hillary would have already known that), it is highly unlikely that the FBI will release any real specifics before the election   if they have anything at all. It s just too early to tell. SEE ALSO: FBI James Comey was board member of HSBC   Clinton Foundation & Drug Cartel  bank of choice The FBI director stoked outrage last month when he announced that he would not recommend the Justice Department seek an indictment against Clinton or any of the other parties to the investigation   allowing Clinton to dodge any criminal probe before the election   despite the fact that Comey stated to a Congressional investigative committee that Clinton was  extremely careless,  and that Clinton openly lied about her handling classified information on her unsecured private server throughout her tenure as the US Secretary of State.Zero Hedge adds: Now, it is the democrats turn to rage at Comey and the FBI, although Comey likely did not have much choice: had he kept the information secret, it certainly would have leaked as we predicted; as such his best recourse was to come clean, although many have speculated about the cryptic nature of the disclosure. Needless to say, all Comey would need to do to regain the Demcorats  trust and favor is to announce in just a few days that nothing material has been found and that the second probe is also over.

23203,FBI REDUX: What’s Behind New Probe into Hillary Clinton Emails?,"21st Century Wire says In a stunning turn of events 11 days before the 2016 presidential election, the FBI announced it is reopenning its investigation into Hillary Clinton s email server case, by probing newly emerging emails linked to Hillary Clinton.  NEW PROBE    The FBI gives Hillary Clinton a second look. (Photo illustraion 21WIRE)FBI October Surprise?According to reports, in a letter written today, FBI Director James Comey, stated that the FBI has begun a new probe into Hillary Clinton related emails once again. Comey offered scant details about the new probe, but due to an unrelated case, additional classified material may have been mishandled on Clinton s personal email server.CNBC reported the latest FBI developments, including a passage from Comey s letter discussing the new investigation: In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton s personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony,  Comey wrote.In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation,  he added.Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony,  Comey concluded. Huma s Estranged  Sexting  HusbandAccording to a new report released via The New York Times: The presidential campaign was rocked on Friday after federal law enforcement officials said that emails pertinent to the now-closed investigation into Hillary Clinton s private email server were discovered on a computer belonging to Anthony D. Weiner, the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide. In a letter to Congress, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said the emails had surfaced in an unrelated case, which law enforcement officials said was an F.B.I. investigation into illicit text messages from Mr. Weiner to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, is married to Huma Abedin, the top aide. Comey has come under fire recently for apparently letting Clinton off the hook for mishandling, and lying to Congress, about classified emails coming through her  home brew  email server while she was Secretary of State. After previously closing the case, Comey has done a U-turn and is now saying the FBI will review the new emails to for classified information, and see whether it was mishandled.This unprecedented investigative move comes just two days after a Wikileaks docu-dump revealed a memo containing detailed financial information between Clinton Foundation donors and former president Bill Clinton s private financial activities. Among those included in the memo, was a $30 million dollar business arrangement under  Bill Clinton, Inc.,  with another $66 million dollar deal scheduled over nine years.The following is a tweet from Brad Jaffy of NBC Nightly News containing the new FBI recommendation The new investigation into the Clinton camp will most certainly spark new  Pay-to-Play  allegations, as the new FBI revelations also comes days after a Project Veritas hidden camera sting operation revealed that the Democratic consultant Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners, discussed ways to commit  large-scale  voter fraud as well as paying political agitators to cause violence at Donald Trump rallies.Out of Creamer s 342 visits to the White House, also included his wife, a 9-term Illinois Democratic congresswoman, Jan Schakowsky some 47 times.White House visitor records show that Schakowsky took 47  private meetings with Obama or his senior staff, also over the past year. The consultancy Democracy Partners appears to have applied Schakowsky as a political buffering point, possibly in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level. The impetus of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain high-ranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics  thus giving a political campaign or political entity plausible deniability.  CAUGHT ON FILM    Robert Creamer resigns over a massive Democratic Party controversy. (Image Source: CNN)Creamer, a convicted felon, (in 2005, Creamer plead guilty $2.3 million in bank fraud and tax violations) was promptly shoved out of the Hillary Clinton campaign s inner circle,  following a heavily publicized video sting revealing his discussion about voter fraud and violence at Trump rallies. PAY TO PLAY?    Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe closely allied with the Clinton s negotiated a a campaign contribution involving the FBI. (Image Source new republic)It remains unclear what exactly reopened the new Clinton probe, but perhaps the FBI had its own cobwebs to clear out after it was revealed that a longtime Clinton associate, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe,  helped steer $675,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an FBI official who went on to lead the probe into Hillary Clinton s use of a private email system, according to a report. The NY Post also reported on the matter this past week: The political action committee of McAuliffe, the Clinton loyalist, gave $467,500 to the state Senate campaign of the wife of Andrew McCabe, who is now deputy director of the FBI, according to the Wall Street Journal.The report states Jill McCabe received an additional $207,788 from the Virginia Democratic Party, which is heavily influenced by McAuliffe.The money directed by McAuliffe began flowing two months after the FBI investigation into Clinton began in July 2015. Around that time, the candidate s husband was promoted from running the Washington field office for the FBI to the No. 3 position at the bureau. In a CNN report from October 18th, a week before the McAuliffe revelations,  According to notes from interviews conducted during an FBI investigation into Clinton s email practices, Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy personally tried to convince FBI officials that the email should be declassified. One interviewee described feeling  pressured  by another FBI official at Kennedy s request. The newly reopened FBI investigation into Clinton could be related to all or some of the items listed above, but there s no doubt that due to public backlash the FBI received following the first Clinton investigation, in addition to concerns over dealings between the FBI and Clinton associates   the agency needed to save face.It remains to be seen how new case will impact the US Presidential election.More from RT below (Image Source: youtube)FBI reopens Clinton investigation as new emails found   ComeyRTThe FBI has learned of more emails involving Hillary Clinton s private email server while she headed the State Department, FBI Director James Comey told several members of Congress, telling them he is reopening the investigation.

Are we due for another October surprise ?RT Everyday that you publish is a day that you have the initiative in the conflict, Assange said via telephone at a conference in Argentina on Wednesday. The whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from Clinton s campaign chair, John Podesta, on a daily basis since early October.Assange claimed the release  whipped up a crazed hornet s nest atmosphere in the Hillary Clinton campaign  leading them to attack WikiLeaks. They attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the UN and British courts to accuse me of being both a Russian spy and a pedophile,  he added.READ MORE: Suspicious US company tried to frame Assange as  pedophile  and Russian spyEcuador s decision to shut down his internet was described by Assange as a  strategic position  so that its  policy of non-intervention can t be misinterpreted by actors in the US and even domestically in Ecuador.

It cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform. He also attacked US TV networks, many of whom he accused of being  controlled by Clinton supporters.

23205,New Bill Gates AI-powered ‘Evolv’ Body Scanners will ‘inspect’ Americans in public spaces,"Beta testing set to begin at transportation hubs in Los Angeles, Denver and Washington for  Total Recall-style  high-speed body scanners  (IMAGE: Mashable)Mark Harris The Guardian  A startup bankrolled by Bill Gates is about to conduct the first public trials of high-speed body scanners powered by artificial intelligence (AI), the Guardian can reveal.According to documents filed with the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Boston-based Evolv Technology is planning to test its system at Union Station in Washington DC, in Los Angeles s Union Station metro and at Denver international airport.Bill Gates: turning society into a technocracy.Evolv uses the same millimetre-wave radio frequencies as the controversial, and painfully slow, body scanners now found at many airport security checkpoints. However, the new device can complete its scan in a fraction of second, using computer vision and machine learning to spot guns and bombs.This means individuals can simply walk through a scanning gate without stopping or even slowing down   like the hi-tech scanners seen in the 1990 sci-fi film Total Recall. A nearby security guard with a tablet is then shown either an  all-clear  sign, or a photo of the person with suspicious areas highlighted. Evolv says the system can scan 800 people an hour, without anyone having to remove their keys, coins or cellphones. The importance of it being fast can t be overstated,  said Aaron Elkins, an AI professor at San Diego State University, who is developing his own AI security technology.  Any place you currently see a metal detector would probably consider an upgrade. Millimetre-wave scanners are useful because they can identify both metallic and non-metallic items, such as 3D printed guns and explosives. But they have also attracted criticism because scanners were able to capture realistic images of people s bodies beneath their clothes. We never build an image that would enable anyone to see anatomical details, so there s no naked peepshow in the first place,  says Michael Ellenbogen, Evolv s CEO.  None of the raw data is stored and none of the data we do keep is traceable to an individual. Evolv claims that no human sees what the scanner is looking at. The system uses solid state micro-antennas to steer radar beams over anyone walking through the gate, and to pick up the reflections. That data is then fed to an AI system that has been trained to spot distinctive scattering patterns from all kinds of objects, including firearms, suicide bomber vests and even knives. The scanner also has a camera that takes a photo of each person passing through, enabling facial recognition.Because it promises to be faster and cheaper than existing millimetre-wave scanners, the new device could bring airport-level screening to venues that were previously difficult to secure Continue this story The GuardianREAD MORE A.I.

23206,After The 2016 Election: A Gullible and Shattered America," David Kerans Strategic CultureBoth inside the US and around the world, political observers have been waiting a long time for an election that would promise relief from the most noxious features of the American system. Alas, while it is high time that the US lead the way in reversing these trends, the outcome of the 18 month struggle to elect a new administration looks likely to scuttle all hopes for serious leadership and reform. I m looking forward to a market crash to awaken the electorate out of our rut, honestly. Because if a Loony Tunes candidate {meaning Donald Trump   DK} doesn t give Democrats the courage to put up a push-left candidate {Bernie Sanders, or some facsimile   DK}, then catastrophe is the only correction we have left.   Commenter  Snapshotist Both inside the US and around the world, political observers have been waiting a long time for an election that would promise relief from the most noxious features of the American system, such as neoliberal economic austerity policies that hamstring governments  ability to maintain basic services and safety nets, military aggression and destabilization of regimes across a wide swathe of the globe, wholesale violation of privacy via NSA surveillance, trade agreements designed to maximize the power of international corporations over national governments, facilitation of fossil fuel extraction and infrastructure in the face of dire climate change consequences, a financial system sucking wealth away from the population and accelerating wealth inequality, and more.Alas, while it is high time that the US lead the way in reversing these trends, the outcome of the 18 month struggle to elect a new presidential administration looks likely to scuttle all hopes for serious leadership and reform on any of these critical issues. It follows, therefore, that in the near term (if not longer), progress will not be possible unless new forms of politics arise to deliver pressure from below on Washington, DC.

23207,REVEALED: The Dark Agenda Behind Globalization and Open Borders,"The T.I.N.A. Doctrine    There Is No Alternative  Brandon Smith Alt-MarketWhen people unfamiliar with the liberty movement stumble onto the undeniable fact of the  conspiracy  of globalism they tend to look for easy answers to understand what it is and why it exists. Most people today have been conditioned to perceive events from a misinterpreted standpoint of  Occam s Razor    they wrongly assume that the simplest explanation is probably the right one.In fact, this is not what Occam s Razor states. Instead, to summarize, it states that the simplest explanation GIVEN THE EVIDENCE at hand is probably the right explanation.It has been well known and documented for decades that the push for globalism is a deliberate and focused effort on the part of a select  elite;  international financiers, central bankers, political leaders and the numerous members of exclusive think tanks. They often openly admit their goals for total globalization in their own publications, perhaps believing that the uneducated commoners would never read them anyway. Carroll Quigley, mentor to Bill Clinton and member of the Council on Foreign Relations, is often quoted with open admissions to the general scheme: The powers of financial capitalism had (a) far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences. The apex of the systems was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland; a private bank owned and controlled by the world s central banks which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank  sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world.    Carroll Quigley, Tragedy And HopeThe people behind the effort to enforce globalism are tied together by a particular ideology, perhaps even a cult-like religion, in which they envision a world order as described in Plato s Republic. They believe that they are  chosen  either by fate, destiny or genetics to rule as philosopher kings over the rest of us. They believe that they are the wisest and most capable that humanity has to offer, and that through evolutionary means, they can create chaos and order out of thin air and mold society at will.This mentality is evident in the systems that they build and exploit. For example, central banking in general is nothing more than a mechanism for driving nations into debt, currency devaluation, and ultimately, enslavement through widespread economic extortion. The end game for central banks is, I believe, the triggering of historic financial crisis, which can then be used by the elites as leverage to promote complete global centralization as the only viable solution.This process of destabilizing economies and societies is not directed by the heads of the various central banks.  Instead, it is directed by even more central global institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements, as outlined in revealing mainstream articles like Ruling The World Of Money published by Harpers Magazine.We also find through the words of globalists that the campaign for a  new world order  is not meant to be voluntary.  When the struggle seems to be drifting definitely towards a world social democracy, there may still be very great delays and disappointments before it becomes an efficient and beneficent world system. Countless people   will hate the new world order   and will die protesting against it. When we attempt to evaluate its promise, we have to bear in mind the distress of a generation or so of malcontents, many of them quite gallant and graceful-looking people.    HG Welles, Fabian Socialist and author of The New World Order In short, the  house of world order  will have to be built from the bottom up rather than f rom the top down. It will look like a great  booming, buzzing confusion,  to use William James  famous description of reality, but an end run around national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece, will accomplish much more than the old-fashioned frontal assault.   Richard Gardner, member of the Trilateral Commission, published in the April, 1974 issue of Foreign Affairs The New World Order cannot happen without U.S. participation, as we are the single most significant component. Yes, there will be a New World Order, and it will force the United States to change its perceptions.    Henry Kissinger, World Action Council, April 19, 1994I could quote globalists all day long, but I think you get the general idea. While some people see globalism as a  natural offshoot  of free markets or the inevitable outcome of economic progress, the reality is that the simplest explanation (given the evidence at hand) is that globalism is an outright war waged against the ideal of sovereign peoples and nations. It is a guerrilla war, or fourth generation warfare, waged by a small group of elites against the rest of us.A significant element of this war concerns the nature of borders. Borders of nations, states and even towns and villages, are not just lines on a map or invisible barriers in the dirt. This is what the elites and the mainstream media would like us to believe. Instead, borders when applied correctly represent principles; or at least, that is supposed to be their function.Human beings are natural community builders; we are constantly seeking out others of like-mind and like-purpose because we understand subconsciously that groups of individuals working together can (often but not always) accomplish more. That said, human beings also have a natural tendency to value individual freedom and the right to voluntary association. We do not like to be forced to associate with people or groups that do not hold similar values.Cultures erect borders because, frankly, people have the right to vet those who wish to join and participate in their endeavors. People also have a right to discriminate against anyone who does not share their core values; or, in other words, we have the right to refuse association with other groups and ideologies that are destructive to our own Continue this story at Alt-MarketREAD MORE NWO NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire NWO Files",Middle-east,"October 27, 2016"

23209,Clinton’s ‘No-Fly Zone’ over Syria Will Not “Save Lives” – It Will Lead to War with Russia,"Prof Michel Chossudovsky Global ReaseachThe media has failed to address the confrontation between the U.S. State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Francis Dunford (image, left) has warned both the US Senate as well Secretary of State John Kerry in no uncertain terms that a  No Fly Zone  over Syria would lead to war with both Syria and Russia, intimating a dangerous process of military escalation.In a Senate Arms Services Committee hearing, Dunford said, responding to questions from Republican Senator Roger Whicker (Mississippi): Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia  That s a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I m not going to make.  (Senate Armed Services Committee, September 22, 2016, emphasis added)At the third presidential debate, Hillary Clinton reasserted her commitment that if elected president, she would implement a no-fly-zone, intimating that the objective was to  save lives : I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict. I am well aware of the really legitimate concerns you have expressed from both the president and the general,  Clinton said in response to a question from Fox News debate moderator Chris Wallace. This would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation and would also take making it clear to the Russians and Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground   I think we could strike a deal and make it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interest of the people on the ground in Syria.  (Fox News, emphasis added)At present, under the Obama administration, the joint chiefs of staff are opposed to the  No Fly zone .The Joint Chiefs of Staff are appointed by the Secretary of Defense.Under a Clinton presidency, a new Secretary of Defense as well as a new Chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, firmly committed to  A No fly Zone  over Syria would be appointed.Mich le Angelique Flournoy, a former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy is Hillary s choice for the position of Secretary of Defense, who favors the  No Fly Zone  option.According to Defense One:  The woman expected to run the Pentagon under Hillary Clinton said she would direct U.S. troops to push President Bashar al-Assad s forces out of southern Syria and would send more American boots to fight the Islamic State in the region.     Confirmed by the Leaked Emails Michele Flournoy is a crony of the Clintons. She has called for  limited military coercion  to help remove Assad from power in Syria, including a  no bombing  zone over parts of Syria held by U.S.-backed rebels. This is tantamount to a no fly zone to protect the terrorists including ISIS Daesh from actions by Syrian and Russian forces.According to Defense One:Flournoy did not deny the entire report that she favors increased U.S. intervention; for instance, she acknowledged her support for U.S.  strikes using standoff weapons   to retaliate against Syrian military targets  to enforce the no-bomb zone Continue this article at Global ResearchREAD MORE HILLARY NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Clinton Files",Middle-east,"October 26, 2016"
23210,Paul Craig Roberts: ‘By Cooperating with Washington on Syria & Russia Walked Into a Trap’," By Paul Crag RobertsA month ago I wrote a column ,  He Who Hesitates Is Lost And Russia Hesitated.  The consequences of this hesitation are now apparent:1. A UN report orchestrated by Washington has accused Syria and Russia of war crimes in Aleppo. According to the report,  indiscriminate airstrikes across the eastern part of the city by Government forces and their allies [Russia] are responsible for the overwhelming majority of civilian casualties. These violations constitute war crimes. And if knowingly committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against civilians, they constitute crimes against humanity. The UN Human Rights Council has now voted to start an  independent  investigation. The purpose of the investigation is to indict Russia and Putin as war criminals and to  bring to justice those responsible for the alleged abuses.  Moreover,  the situation should be urgently referred to the International Criminal Court. Every party to this conflict must know that they will be held accountable for the international crimes they commit   all, without selective protection or discrimination.  Keep in mind that Washington provides the largest share of the UN s budget, and the UN will overlook that it was Washington that sent ISIS to Aleppo.Obviously, neither Washington nor the UN will be able to drag Putin into the International Criminal Court, but a war criminal charge can serve Washington s purpose by stopping Putin from traveling abroad and curtailing his diplomatic efforts. The purpose of this orchestrated exercise is its propaganda value. Among Washington s many concerns is that some Eastern European countries, alarmed by the conflict that Washington is leading them into with Russia, will threaten NATO with a non-participation statement. If Russia is branded a war criminal, it becomes even more difficult for countries that foolishly and thoughtlessly joined NATO to extricate themselves from the consequences.2. Washington has succeeded in bringing to power in Poland the far right-wing Law and Justice Party. These agents of Washington have re-opened the matter of the death of Poland s President Kaczynski in a plane crash, making wild claims that the crash was a terror attack by Russia aimed at depriving Poland of its political leadership. Despite massive and convincing evidence to the contrary, the Law and Justice Party s claims will find traction thanks to the scary portrait of Russia painted by Washington s demonization campaign. The intended result is to further blacken and isolate Russia and its government.3. As the anointed spokesperson for the neoconservative warmongers, Hillary wants Washington to enforce a no-fly zone in Syria. A no-fly zone would require Washington to attempt to prevent Syrian and Russian air strikes against ISIS positions. It seems clear enough that Syria and Russia would not accept any attempt to deny Syria the use of the country s own airspace in the conflict against forces sent by Washington to overthrow the Syrian government, as happened to Gaddafi in Libya. Unless Russia and Syria surrender, Hillary s no-fly zone would result in military conflict between Russia and the US.To advance the no-fly zone proposal, the  use of chemical weapons  ruse has been resurrected. Fabricated reports are appearing that the Syrian air force is guilty of dropping chemical weapons on the Syrian population. On October 22, the Indian Express reported that on October 21 the UN-Led Joint Investigative Mechanism informed the UN Security Council that the chemical attack on Qmenas  was caused by a Syrian Arab Armed Forces helicopter dropping a device from a high altitude which hit the ground and released the toxic substance that affected the population.  The report concluded that three of the chemical attacks investigated were made by Syria and one by the Islamic State.The fact that the Russians resolved the chemical weapons issue in 2014, a year before the alleged attack on Qmenas, by taking possession of the weapons and removing them from Syria means that the report has little credibility. However, at no time during Washington s 15-year-old attack on Muslim countries have facts played any role, and certainly facts have played no role in Washington s demonization of Russia.4. Diana Johnstone has concluded that Hillary intends regime change for Russia and will use the presidency for that purpose.It is impossible to imagine a purpose more reckless and irresponsible. Many members of the Russian government have stated that Washington s provocation and demonization of Russia have brought trust between the nuclear powers close to zero and that Russia will never again fight a war on her own territory Continue this article at The Institute for Political EconomyREAD MORE RUSSIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Russia Files",Middle-east,"October 26, 2016"
23211,"Insider Firm ‘FlashPoint’ tied to Orlando Shooting, Now Investigating DDoS Hack on America","Shawn Helton  21st Century WireIn the wake of the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that targeted many online companies and news agencies last week such as Amazon, Netflix, CNN and The New York Times, we learned that the threat intelligence firm Flashpoint assumed the lead public relations role in the media after the event   just as they did following the highly suspicious Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando this past the summer. Flashpoint is said to be investigating the nature of the alleged  hacker DDoS attacks against the networks of the internet traffic management company Dyn and many others just days ago.Later in this report, we ll focus our attention on the uncanny ties between the firm Flashpoint, the Orlando Shooting and the massive internet related outage this past week.But first things first, let s review elements of the recent DDoS attack in America   CYBER GAMES    The DDoS attack story falls in line with a designer western political agenda. (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)On October 21st, the technology blog Engadget discussed the cyber attacks that led to an internet outage across America and other parts of the world: Today s nation-wide internet outage was enabled thanks to a Mirai botnet that hacked into connected home devices, according to security intelligence company Flashpoint. The distributed denial of service attack targeted Dyn, a large domain name server, and took down Twitter, Spotify, Reddit, The New York Times, Pinterest, PayPal and other major websites. Flashpoint has observed Mirai attack commands issued against Dyn infrastructure,  Flashpoint writes.  Analysts are still investigating the potential impact of this activity and it is not yet clear if other botnets are involved. The Engadget article mentioned above, further explained that security experts had been prepping the public for an eventual Mirai malware attack since its code open-source was leaked: The author of the Mirai malware made its code open-source, and security experts have been warning of a possible large-scale attack since this information came to light. In another media supplied back story the coming  launch  of Mirai was discussed through the security based website managed by Brian Krebs, on KrebsOnSecurity   who ironically, have twice been the victim of cyber attacks over the years: The source code that powers the  Internet of Things  (IoT) botnet responsible for launching the historically large distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against KrebsOnSecurity last month has been publicly released. Interestingly, according to Bradley Barth, a senior reporter for the IT security online magazine SC, the Mirai (supposedly leaked on September 30th) contains a very unique subset of characteristics that will not attack certain IP addresses such as the Department of Defense (DoD), the US Postal Service and consumer giant General Electric (GE) due to its coding: An Imperva analysis of the source code revealed several unique traits, including a hardcoded blacklist of IPs that the adversary did not want to attack, perhaps in order to keep a low profile. Some of these IPs belonged to the Department of Defense, the U.S. Postal Service and General Electric (GE). Though SC claims that the makers of Mirai may have been trying to keep a low profile, the recent DDoS attack attributed to the malware was as high-profile as you can get   so this begs the question, what was the real reason the malware creators put an IP blockade on the DoD, the Postal Service and GE?Is it possible the malware originated from whitehat hackers associated with the US government, or from a major US defense contractor like GE?Politico disclosed that the hacktivist avatar known as the  New World Hackers  and Anonymous (now a ubiquitous brand which could be anyone or anything) were responsible for the DDoS attack on Twitter and others, adding that  U.S. officials preached caution, arguing there is still scant evidence to determine who is behind the attack, warning that both groups have falsely taken credit for high-profile attacks in the past.  Flashpoint then declared that the group were  imposters,  as the article then referenced Obama s recent far-fetched claims that Russia is somehow  meddling  with US elections through proxy hackers   once again, without offering any definitive proof.Mainstream media pundits, including those at CNN, were also quick to dismiss the New World Hackers as an  illegitimate group  who had  falsely taken credit for hacks in the past. Less than 24 hours after the nationwide DDoS cyberattack, former Homeland Security Advisor to United States President George W. Bush, Fran Townsend, (left photo) reignited the ever popular blame Russia  meme (as we predicted) in a CBS article: CBS News homeland security consultant Fran Townsend pointed to Russia as a possible instigator. Is this sort of a brushback pitch from the Russians sending us a message that we should be pretty careful about engaging in this sort of cyberactivity with them because they are very capable,  she said. Townsend, also made the rounds on media after the bizarre anomaly ridden Nice Attack, pushing the mainstream narrative.In our first report regarding the alleged hack on America, we discussed the DDoS event and how it would be politicized by the media and US officials to blame Russia, feeding into the false claims that the Kremlin is somehow tampering with the 2016 US elections. We also talked about how the incident might be used to push a newer and more restrictive Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and its Senate doppelg nger, the PROTECT IP Act aka PIPA   dual provisions aimed at restricting the use of copyrighted material on the internet, which could have vast implications on free speech. It is also important to reiterate that one of the main issues concerning the US government as the cyberspshere grows is ISP  governance  which is code for making ISP comply to any unlawful requests by Federal authorities   including cutting internet access to individuals or organizations deemed to be  undesirable  by the state.Last week s choreographed cyber attack on popular websites and companies that allegedly spread through the Mirai botnet malware via the Internet of Things (IoT), has opened up another aspect of the story. This part of the narrative, appears to prey on the fears of the general public as IoT devices have become increasingly connected, setting the stage for new security protocols and new cyber security products to be conveniently rolled out at any future date following a cyber crisis.It should be mentioned that the security firm Flashpoint was front and center (along with the internet performance company DYN)   weighing in on the situation prior to any US intelligence agency making an official statement.Flashpoint operates as an intelligence watchdog, as well as an intelligence asset, in addition to playing a PR role for some recent large-scale incidents   but who are they really?  PUZZLE PIECE     The security firm Flashpoint delves into the deep dark web for its clients. Screen Shot Image Source: (flashpoint-intel.com)Meet FlashpointAccording to Flashpoint s own website, they are a private cybersecurity firm that is composed of a diverse crew of white-hat hackers, engineers, analysts, salespeople, marketers, and operations specialists [who] are fearlessly problem-solving as we change the way organizations evaluate risk. The clandestine firm adds that their  premium Business Risk Intelligence solutions afford superlative access and visibility into opaque areas of the Internet, empowering our clients to defend themselves against various cyber and physical threats. While looking into Flashpoint s investor section, we learn that the American venture capital firm Greycroft Partners is listed among those contributing to the security firm. It turns out that Greycroft is also a large campaign contributor to the Clinton campaign, as discussed by Huffinton Post: At least eight hedge funders are listed as Clinton fundraisers, collecting more than $100,000 each for the campaign. These include Blair Effron of Centerview Partners, Marc Lasry of Avenue Capital Group, Orin Kramer of Boston Provident, Charles Myers of Evercore, Deven Parekh of Insight Venture Partners, Alan Patricof of Greycroft Partners, and Lisa Perry, who is married to Perry Capital CEO Richard Perry.  FLARE UP    Here s Flashpoint s mission statement. (Screen Shot Image Source: (flashpoint-intel.com)While Greycroft s contributions to the Clinton campaign are somewhat of a sidebar to the recent internet outage attack, it does represent another uncanny business and political connection that links a secretive firm (Flashpoint) that appears to be taking a large role in steering the public s perception over certain incidents occurring in America. You have to wonder if this is really just a coincidence?By this, we can see just how tight the elite inner circle is, with a small collective of corporate and media gatekeeper   and their political operatives   all carefully stage-managing the narrative around almost every high-profile controversial event in America, and also in Europe too.From America s largest mass shooting to America s largest Internet outage?On June 24th, less than two weeks after the Orlando shooting at Pulse Nightclub, Flashpoint was said to have acted as a  translator  for al Qaeda s terror publication Inspire, which according to the security-based firm, appeared to be  claiming some responsibility  for the shooting even though the purported shooter Omar Mateen was allegedly linked to ISIS.The NBC report stated the following on June 24th: Flashpoint co-founder Evan Kohlmann, an NBC terrorism analyst pointed out that even though Mateen cited ISIS as the inspiration for the attack, al Qaeda seemed to be claiming some responsibility because it has called for  lone wolf  attacks against the West. Kohlmann said the statement   which lauded Mateen as a heroic  lone jihad  holy warrior   appears to be an official Inspire release. But he said it was far less professional than others, including one after the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings that went to great lengths to praise the Tsarnaev brothers, who said they learned to make their explosive devices from another Inspire publication. The purported terror publication Inspire has come under fire in recent years as some critics charge that the magazine may actually be a CIA creation, something which is echoed through its ties to the dubious AQAP terror operation.During our summertime investigation into the suspicious events at the Orlando Pulse nightclub, we found evidence that Omar Mateen s worldwide security firm G4S was a client of the crisis staging company called Crisis Cast. The following is a passage from that report: Truth is often stranger than fiction when looking at the bizarre phenomena surrounding many mass casualty incidents   and the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting was no exception.It was recently revealed that the world s largest security firm G4S, who had employed the man named in the Orlando pulse nightclub shooting, Omar Mateen  is a client of the mass casualty staging company called CrisisCast.   STAGING REALITY    CrisisCast specializes in replicating mass casualty events. (Screen Shot Image Source crisiscast)Casting Crisis & Training for Disaster The heavily-stylized company CrisisCast, appears to be a revamped version of the Visionbox Crisis Actors project (a crisis actor production emerging after Sandy Hook), with a professional team of actors, elaborate film crews, expert producers and theatrical effects makeup squads mimicking real-life injuries (additional prosthetics)   all focused to deliver a simulated crisis-likereality to the public, later to be managed accordingly through their public relations division via various forms of social media. RELATED: (VIDEO)  Active Shooter  and  Terror  Drills: The Truth WILL Shock YouInterestingly, another client listed on the Crisis Cast website appeared to be another company named Flashpoint, apparently unrelated to the internet based security firm   MILITARIZED    Another company also called Flashpoint, was tacitly connected to the Orlando shooting via Crisis Cast. (Screen Shot Image Source crisiscast)There is nothing concrete linking the two Flashpoint companies but the very fact that both are tied to the Orlando shooting, albeit in an opaque way, suggests there could be some deeper connection.Is  Flashpoint   Reality Based Training,  the militarized counterpart to the cybersecurity firm Flashpoint?Here s Flashpoint   Reality Based Training describing the reality they construct for their clients, which appears to fall in line with the internet based Flashpoint: Environments will need to become more realistic   the sights, sounds and smells will increase in fidelity.  We believe the requirement for combined live and virtual events will increase and that these will be networked geographically by governments, military and NGOs. We also anticipate an increase in the requirement for us to track trainees and deliver accurate after-action reviews as part of our Reality Based Training.

23213,Trump’s Latest Tease Pales Next to Bush and Gore’s Election War in 2000," It s teetering on the ridiculous watching the US mainstream media get their knickers in a twist over Donald Trump s provocative comments during the last Presidential Debate about the possibility of election rigging,  and whether or not he would respect the official result on November 8th.Paul Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House, also weighed in decriying Trump s assertion akin to a  threat to democracy , stating,  Our democracy relies on confidence in election results, and the speaker is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity. More than a bit melodramatic, considering recent history It seems that the unashamed pro-Clinton US mainstream media have an incredibly short memory. Remember the 2000 Presidential race between George W. Bush (Republican) and Al Gore (Democrat)? It was not only contested, the election was eventually called on a technicality by the US Supreme Court.Who held up the election: the very same Democratic Party who are going hysterical over Trump s recent off-hand remarks. Again, that same Democratic Party also cried foul in 2004, when John Kerry lost by a narrow margin to the incumbent Bush.Was there fraud and rigging in 2000 and 2004? Many leading leftwing media pundits still think so, and yet the US liberal-dominated mainstream media and political savants still equate Trump s comments with a coup d etat threat.Brasscheck TV says: Here s sanitized, mainstream news media s account of  the endless campaign of 2000.  And even their version is wild and unbelievable   Anyone who has seriously studied the issue knows that the level of voter fraud, although not zero, is minuscule, and that in-person impersonation hardly ever exists. Yet by saying it over and over, Trump is fanning flames that are dangerous for our democracy.

23215,"SOPA False Flag? Alleged ‘Hack’ on Netflix, Twitter, Amazon – US ready to blame Russia","Shawn Helton 21st Century WireYesterday, a wave of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks hit some of the top online companies websites including Amazon, Netflix, Twitter and Reddit. One cannot rule out the very real possibility that this a staged-managed event, especially when you consider The New York Times was listed among those affected. If recent US media and political themes are anything to go by, you can expect a cascading chorus of blame directed at Russia.In this age of America s new and improved trial by media format, you can expect a litany of unfounded accusations, along with the usual anti-Russia hyperbole and waving fingers at Washington s new go-to scapegoat   Russian president Vladimir Putin.The likelihood of Russia or any other country being involved in this heavily coordinated DDoS incident falls flat, when you consider that the US media has been floating the  blame Russia  meme for months now, and even more conveniently during this 2016 US presidential election cycle, led by Vice President Joe Biden, and of course, the Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, all blaming the Kremlin for both the DNC Leaks and the Wikileaks email dump.Indeed, as you look back at NY Times articles since the summer, the stage was being set to implant the idea of an alleged Russian cyber war being waged at the US, principally charging that they would  meddle  with the US presidential elections in 2016 by aiding Donald Trump. Here s the NY Times building the case for Washington, seemingly without the burden of proof: An unusual question is capturing the attention of cyberspecialists, Russia experts and Democratic Party leaders in Philadelphia: Is Vladimir V. Putin trying to meddle in the American presidential election?Until Friday, that charge, with its eerie suggestion of a Kremlin conspiracy to aid Donald J. Trump, has been only whispered. In August, the western media s claims against Russia hit overdrive, when the  New York Times s Moscow bureau was the target of an attempted cyberattack this month. But so far, there is no evidence that the hackers, believed to be Russian, were successful. Flash forward to September here and here, as well as early October in the lead up to President Obama s decree, the Clinton friendly outlet the NY Times had all but solidified the Russian cyber/hack claims   once again, without any definitive proof.If Russia is going to be the scapegoat for this recent DDoS attack, then consider the following   HACK ATTACK?    Who was behind the Black Friday internet outage in America? (Photo illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)Immediately when the cyber attack story broke, the establishment quickly wheeled out their  experts , as CNN s chief gatekeeper Wolf Blitzer cued-up scripted questions to Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) advocate, Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn (R, TN), Vice Chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Not only is Blackburn is a staunch supporter of more draconian copyright laws (she once claimed that  Fair Use  was the same as  theft), she is also a fellow traveller on Washington s Anti-Russia bandwagon.In true propagandist fashion, Blitzer wasted no time asking her,  Do you think this be the work of a foreign government?  Blackburn immediately blamed the hack on the fact that the SOPA bill didn t pass, claiming that SOPA  would have blocked some of the bad actors ,  and went on to blame  cyber bots  (activists) for defeating the bill. From the obvious way that Washington oracle CNN had this story already cued up, it strongly indicates that the Washington was stage-managing this latest  cyber crisis.  WAITING IN THE WINGS: Tennessee  Republican Congressman Marsha Blackburn.As scapegoats go, blaming Russia is the gift that keeps on giving (and way past this Christmas). Last week, President Obama threw Hillary Clinton a campaign assist by formally accusing Russia of interfering with US elections process through Wikileaks. Suddenly, Washington had declared a Cyber War against Russia. The NY Times wrote: Since the Obama administration formally accused Russia about a week ago of trying to interfere in the election, there has been intense speculation about whether President Obama has ordered the National Security Agency to conduct a retaliatory cyberstrike.Despite all the White House and corporate media hype, no evidence at all has been presented by Washington that proves the Kremlin are hacking and  interfering with the US election process. Vice President Joe Biden, also spoke on matters of security and sent a telegraphed  message to Putin  through NBC s Meet the Press, just one day after Obama s own  Russian  declaration. Based on these latest developments, it s easy to see how this could have been an effort prime another back story to blame Russia for these DDoS attacks.The real question surrounding this apparent DDoS attack, should be directed at America s National Security Agency (NSA) and its bevy of contractors, many of whom are tasked with global and (illegal) domestic surveillance, through passive data collection and clandestine processing of communications. Surely they would know where this attack was originated (including in-house).Could this latest incident possibly be to further create a  climate of fear  during this, the most contentious presidential election in 40 years?Could this also be a government-coordinated cyber drill?Was this a government orchestrated false flag hack?It s no secret that the US government would like to pass a newer more potent version of 2011-2012 s  Stop Online Piracy Act otherwise known as SOPA. In fact, NextGov, reported the following in 2014: Nearly three years after a massive online protest derailed the Stop Online Piracy Act, many lawmakers are still nervous about even uttering the name  SOPA  in public.The bill, which once had broad bipartisan support and was a top priority for the entertainment industry, has become a dirty word. The backlash was a traumatic lesson for members of Congress about the danger of siding against tech companies and Internet activists, who warned the bill could break the Internet.Now, for the first time since SOPA crashed and burned in early 2012, the House Judiciary Committee is preparing to work on a major update of copyright law. As lawmakers cautiously return to the issue of copyright protection, the SOPA protest looms large in their minds. Tech outlet Wired described the incident in the following manner. It s crucial to note that the internet performance management company Dyn was front and center   weighing in on the situation prior to any US intelligence agency making an official statement. Dyn states: This morning s attack started around 7 am ET and was aimed at Dyn, an Internet infrastructure company headquartered in New Hampshire. That first bout was resolved after about two hours; a second attack began just before noon. Dyn reported a third wave of attacks a little after 4 pm ET. In all cases, traffic to Dyn s Internet directory servers throughout the US primarily on the East Coast but later on the opposite end of the country as well was stopped by a flood of malicious requests from tens of millions of IP addresses disrupting the system. Late in the day, Dyn described the events as a  very sophisticated and complex attack.  Still ongoing, the situation is a definite reminder of the fragility of the web, and the power of the forces that aim to disrupt it. Regardless of who was actually behind the widespread internet attack, judging by the rhetoric and the mainstream media talking points  this has to be about the government wanting to usher in new  ISP governance  (making ISP s bent to government wishes to  kick out the bad actors  off their networks) and rights-violating security protocols. Is it also possible that social media giant Twitter and mega-consumer brands like Amazon have been used as willing guinea pigs, just like Yahoo was recently when their mailable CEO Marissa Mayer handed over the backdoor keys to Yahoo customer email account to the NSA and FBI.Are the US government determined to gain complete access and have total control over the internet?The idea isn t that far-fetched Yahoo s Marissa Mayer: sold out to the NSA.After Yahoo recently admitted to creating a virtual backdoor for US intelligence agencies to spy on everyday citizen s email accounts, the government exposed its own Orwellian ambitions: Yahoo last year secretly built a custom software program to search all of its customers  incoming emails for specific information provided by US intelligence officials, according to people familiar with the matter.The company complied with a classified US government directive, scanning hundreds of millions of Yahoo Mail accounts at the behest of the National Security Agency or FBI, two former employees and a third person apprised of the events said. This is a very important issue moving forward, as a dip in consumer confidence could be a crushing blow to any company s overall brand after complying with new  1984  security measures   all at the behest of the FBI, NSA, CIA and their trusted partners.Back in March, individual privacy versus global security was at the heart of the case between Apple and the FBI. Here s a telling passage from that report as it relates to this most recent internet attack: The ongoing encryption saga between Apple and the FBI, we stated that there are no guarantees in the security world, especially if a digital master-key were to be created, as this would potentially make it easier for invaders (either the government, or various hackers) mining for data moving forward into the future.In a recent Guardian article, some of those involved in the technology and security sector offered their thoughts regarding the government s continued encroachment on individual privacy: Dan Kaminsky, the security expert who made his name with the discovery that one of the most basic parts of the internet, the domain name system, was vulnerable to fraud   disagrees:  Feds want final authority on engineering decisions, and their interests don t even align with fighting the vast bulk of real-world crime. Kaminsky further explained why Apple s security measures already help law enforcement, If my iPhone is stolen, my emails stay unread, my photos stay unviewed, and I don t need to notify anyone that the secrets they entrusted me with are going to show up on the internet tomorrow. Continuing, The Guardian interviewed former FBI agent Michael German, currently at judicial think-tank the Brennan Center. The following is a portion of that interview: After 9/11, you had this concept of total information awareness. The intelligence community was very enamoured of the idea that all information was available. Much like the NSA, they wanted to see it all, collect it all, and analyse it all. Additionally, there are many who believe weaker encryption may pose an even bigger security risk globally.In many ways, it appears as though federal agencies are seemingly searching for the right crisis to push public opinion in favor of the state when it comes to security.This is at the core of the perpetual privacy and security battle post 9/11 How could it be that such propaganda could happen in America?

23217,COVER-UP: Both Obama and Clinton Lied About Trading Classified Emails,"21st Century Wire says  The mainstream media have gone to great lengths to hide obfuscate the following story.During an interview with CBS News on March 7, 2015, President Barack Obama claimed he only learned about Hillary Clinton s use of a private email server,  the same time everybody else learned it through news reports. Subsequent email leaks show, however, that Obama in fact lied when he said he  didn t know  Clinton used an unsecure private server. According to the Daily Caller, newly released FBI documents show that: Obama used a pseudonym when communicating with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by email, and at least one of those emails ended up on Clinton s private email server. This proves two things: not only did Obama break White House security protocol by carelessly trading private emails  off grid  with Hillary Clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server   but he also lied about it after the fact.(NOTE: This would not have been as big of an issue for Obama had he simply not commented on the issue, or actually told the truth, but this is president who struggles on both those fronts) COVER-UP: Attorney General Loretta Lynch, FBI Director James Comey, and President Obama.This leads us to the FBI  led by its director and elite fixer, James Comey, the FBI carefully whitewashed over the Clinton email case   to protect the President. Cleary, the FBI and the DOJ closed ranks to protect the President, but  from what  you might ask? This is why: any communications made by the President of the United States are de facto labeled as  born classified.   The same goes for any State Department communications with other foreign ministers.It also proves that Hillary Clinton is lied when she claimed that  no classified emails  lived on her private server. They both lied.From the beginning of this scandal, at every turn it seems, the Democratic Party nominee has lied about having classified emails on her unauthorized private server, and this week we discover that one of her State Department operatives, Patrick Kennedy, tried to shield her culpability by asking the FBI to downgrade the classification of certain emails in exchange for  quid pro quo  political favors.Maybe it s an attitude certain people in Washington have (especially if they are the party in power), that they are  above the law  and not subject to the same rules as their lessers in Washington. But the fact remains: both Clinton and Obama lied to the American people, but let off by a corrupt US media who appear to be more concerned about getting Clinton elected   than holding any Washington s power elite accountable.According to Clinton though, all this is somehow  Vladimir Putin s fault.

Within those are emails sent from secret address used by the president.The first batch from Wikileaks are searchable under the email address bobama@ameritech.net, an email account Obama was possibly using before winning the election in November 2008.Among them is an email, dated October 30, 2008, from John Podesta to then-Senator Obama, with a confidential attachment, discussing an economic transition team, mapping out why Obama needs to get it up and running before his term begins in January 2009.

23219,SHOCKING: DNC Contractor Caught in Voter Fraud Sting Visited White House 342 Times,"21st Century Wire saysFollowing a wave of hidden camera sting operations captured by the investigative non-profit Project Veritas, it has now been revealed that the Democratic consultant Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners, met with White House officials some 342 times over the past year.    SCANDAL    (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)The DailyMail reported the following as it relates to the Democratic campaign bombshell: A convicted felon caught up in a pair of stinging political expos s has visited the Obama White House 342 times, according to the administration s records, including several visits to the Obama family s residence and one, in October of last year, to the Oval Office.Robert Creamer was caught on one hidden-camera video discussing ways to commit large-scale voter fraud, and talking in another about paying liberal activists to start fights and otherwise disrupt Donald Trump rallies.Democracy Partners, the community organizing firm that until Tuesday employed Creamer, works hand-in-hand with Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign.   CAUGHT ON FILM    Robert Creamer resigns over massive Democratic Party controversy. (Image Source: CNN)Creamer s visits to the White House also included his wife, a 9-term Illinois Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky.White House visitor records show that Schakowsky took 47  private meetings with Obama or his senior staff, also over the past year. The consultancy Democracy Partners appears to have applied Schakowsky as a political buffering point, possibly in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level. The impetus of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain high ranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics.Creamer, a convicted felon, (in 2005, Creamer plead guilty $2.3 million in bank fraud and tax violations) was promptly shoved out of the Hillary Clinton campaign s inner circle,  following a heavily publicized sting that caught the Democratic consultant discussing how to commit large-scale voter fraud, while also apparently outlining how to incite violence at campaign rallies.Scott Foval, the former national field director at Americans United for Change also discussed controversial and apparent criminal campaign methods, prompting him to be fired after the Project Veritas video footage went viral. Whatever your political persuasion and whether or not Wikileaks may or may not be just another western intelligence asset masquerading in public, some of the emails recently released have raised some interesting questions. Notably, the dissent among the Clinton campaign, the Clinton Foundation s perceived misconduct in Haiti, an email disclosing that ISIS received clandestine financial and logistic support from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which was a story that dovetailed another possible  Pay-for-Play  scheme, in the form of an attempted Qatari gift to Bill Clinton for $1 million in 2012.Other  Wikileaks  of importance, presented the collusion between the Clinton campaign and media arms the Associated Press and The New York Times, the latter of which in the last 24 hours, has provided damage control for Hillary Clinton s sycophantic Wall Street speeches that outline an amnesty-laden open borders strategy as well as a rights dissolving trade deal like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The TPP trade deal has been covered extensively at 21WIRE over the past few years and is under the guise of a so-called  free-trade  agreement. The international trade law for new trade treaties appears to be a way for private corporations to exempt themselves from the laws of sovereign nations, something which belies a truly free market the world over.Despite the Democratic candidate s timely flip flop shift over the TPP deal during the election cycle   she provided a lot of vocal support for the deal while seating as the Secretary of State.Indeed, as released in the Wikileaks batch #12, Democratic pollster Joel Benenson, is quoted as stating the following, the reality is HRC is more pro trade than anti and trying to turn her into something she is not could reinforce our negative [sic] around authenticity. This is an agreement that she pushed for and largely advocated for. Interestingly, one of the most impactful and potentially criminal docu-dumps to come out recently was released by the FBI this week, which according to Real Clear Politics, outlined the following  quid pro quo  allegations: Notes from an interview with a now-retired FBI agent suggest that the State Department tried to get the FBI to declassify a Benghazi-related email found on Hillary Clinton s private email server, in exchange for the State Department allowing the FBI to place more undercover agents in certain countries. The conversation allegedly took place while the State Department was engaged in a review to prepare emails from Hillary Clinton s private server for public release. The Washington Post added the following on the matter: The purported  quid pro quo  between [Brian] McCauley and [Pat] Kennedy was first reported over the weekend by Fox News and The Weekly Standard and confirmed Monday when the FBI released dozens of interview summaries from its criminal investigation into Clinton s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. According to FOX News: Undersecretary [Patrick] Kennedy s attempt to barter away American national security interests for plainly political purposes is appalling, and may rise to the level of a federal crime,  Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., wrote in a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Tuesday.In the heavily redacted files, known as 302s, an FBI official described the incident with Under Secretary for Management Patrick Kennedy as a  quid pro quo.  According to the files, in exchange for marking a particular email unclassified, the State Department would  reciprocate  by letting the FBI place  more Agents in countries where they are presently forbidden. If true, these FBI and State Department files could reveal yet another glaring example of collusion that may have provided political protection for presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.Both the FBI and State Department deny any arrangement was made. However, records show that Kennedy attempted to reduce the number of classified emails linked to Clinton s personal server.In early October, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) dropped all charges against an American arms dealer named Marc Turi, whose weapons made it into the hands of radical Libya militants.According to federal court records obtained by Politico: The deal averts a trial that threatened to cast additional scrutiny on Hillary Clinton s private emails as Secretary of State, and to expose reported Central Intelligence Agency attempts to arm rebels fighting Libyan leader Moammar Qadhafi. It also worth mentioning again that over the summer we discussed how the 2016 s DNC convention was the latest in a long line of sordid political productions. Bernie Sanders delegates staged a mass walkout after a series of email leaks disclosed that a Clinton lawyer gave the DNC strategy advice on how to sideline the Sanders campaign.Expect the Clinton campaign and the White House to whitewash the DNC voter fraud fallout and other FBI allegations as another scandal replaces them. Something to watch for will be the case of former Joint Chiefs of Staff vice chairman General James Cartwright, who plead guilty this week to felony charges of lying to the FBI after allegedly leaking classified material about covert operations against two Iranian journalists.Here s another look at one of the many DNC operatives outlining how to disrupt a Trump political rally through intimidation. More from Zero Hedge below Why Did Vote-Rigging Robert Creamer Visit The White House Over 200 Times During The Obama Admin?Zero HedgeEarlier today we wrote about a new Project Veritas undercover video that uncovered several democratic operatives openly discussing, in explicit detail, how to commit massive voter fraud.  One of the operatives was a person by the name of Robert Creamer who is a co-founder of a democratic consulting firm called Democracy Partners.  Within the video, an undercover journalist details a plan to register Hispanic voters illegally by having them work as contractors, to which Creamer can be heard offering support saying that  there are a couple of organizations that that s their big trick  (see:  Rigging Elections For 50 Years    Massive Voter Fraud Exposed By Project Veritas Part 2 ).Unfortunately, the embarrassing video caused Creamer to subsequently resign from consulting the Hillary campaign as he issued a statement saying that he was  stepping back from my responsibilities working the [Hillary] campaign  over fears that his continued assistance would be a distraction for the campaign.Zero Hedge continues here READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"October 20, 2016"

23221,CIA GATEKEEPER? CNN’s Chris Cuomo says Americans are ‘criminals’ for reading WikiLeaks’ Clinton email dump," 21st Century Wire says CNN s Chris Cuomo (image, above) is certainly one of America s most maligned and gaff-prone mainstream media pundits. But are these really gaffs, or is there more to this media operative?This week, Cuomo went into full establishment mode, by attempting to scare the American public into NOT viewing Wikileaks emails online.Cuomo declared this week,  Also interesting is remember, it s illegal to possess, ah, the stolen documents   it s different for the media. So everything you re learning about this, you re learning from us. After Cuomo s fatal misstep, he quickly began back-pedaling and obfuscating his troubling position regarding public access to items that are in the public interest:What is even more disturbing about Cuomo s off-hand legal declarations here, is that he is doing so in defense of Hillary Clinton s presidential run   whose numerous scandals are pervasive throughout the Wikileaks emails. This is hardly the role of a  journalist. NEWSFLASH FOR CNN: If the leaked documents are about elected and appointed public officials (especially those seeking the presidency), and the content exposes illegal and unethical activities   and is clearly in the public interest (which these emails are)   then any decent journalist worth their salt (no such thing at CNN) would publish them and even encourage the public to comb over the documents, unless the media outlet in question functions as a gatekeeper (which CNN does). SEE ALSO: Congressman Jim Jordan stops CNN gatekeeper Chris Cuomo on Benghazi cover-upAs the son of former New York governor Mario Cuomo, and the brother of New York governor Andrew Cuomo, Chris is part of a political dynasty family and member of an elite establishment.

23223,REVEALED: How Democratic Party pays Agit-Prop ‘Protesters’ to incite violence at Trump events," By Anthony Brian Logan . James O Keefe of Project Veritas has released undercover, button-camera video that outlines the process of bird-dogging and how it is being used to rig the 2016 Presidential election of the United States in favor of Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party. The central focus of the video, which is a collection of various undercover videos with commentary, is the process of  bird-dogging  which refers to essentially hiring people to behave as the equivalent to crisis actors. Except for the fact that there is no actual crisis, and these people are used to simply incite violence, among other things, to goad the media into giving Donald Trump s campaign negative coverage.Various people appear in the video, complete with both audio and video, saying how they skirt the laws of our nation to engage in corruption. Hillary Clinton s campaign is not allowed to directly collude with the phony actors on the ground, so they use degrees of separation by hiring consultants. These consultants then go on to sub contract work  on the ground  such as the actors who engage in fake riots and protests.

23225,“PROPHECY” PROPAGANDA: Zionist Millennialism Refuted," Jay Dyer 21st Century WireDemonstrating where bad hermeneutics and theology lead, plus evidence of a continued conspiracy against historic Orthodox Christianity.Pastor John Hagee of the the large Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas has recently published a book,  In Defense of Israel,  in which he outlines in detail his own total apostasy from the most basic of Christian beliefs that Christ was the Messiah! See our posted video where he states it plain as day. But what is the root of this problem? I say several things. Aside from his own dubious character and obvious bad will, the cause can be found in bad hermeneutics. Hermeneutics is the science of interpretation how we interpret he texts of Sacred Scripture.SEE ALSO: The Holy Business: End-Times Buffoonery in a Modern WorldWhen I saw Hagee on the Glenn Beck Show a couple weeks ago talking about Israel non-stop, I knew something was going on. I used to use John Hagee s  Prophecy Study Bible as an idiot evangelical when I was 18 (several years ago), so I can speak from experience concerning Hagee (also having read some of his books and watched his  prophecy  lectures). END TIMES 2.0: Pastor John Hagee attempting to rapture his flock  (donor base) to the promise land after a possible nuclear Armageddon.  Let s examine some errors of the false hermeneutic of the premillennialists and evangelicals. The first error this entire system is built upon is the idea that Israel is still God s chosen covenant nation. God s promises to Abraham s descendants were purely literal and never able to be revoked, this view holds. God is bound in his eternal love to the literal nation of Israel, even though they have rejected Christ for the most part for the past 2000 years. However, historic Orthodox Christianity has always taught that the Church of Christ is the New Israel, the true bride of Christ, that faithfully keeps the testimony of Christ (Apoc. 12:17). Let s look at some texts that show this point:1. When we examine Christ s parable of the wicked vinedressers, we see an explicit statement from our Lord concerning the possession of the kingdom of God. Keep in mind, Hagee and all his evangelical &liberal friends think God has never, in any sense, revoked the old covenant with Israel, and that they are still the possessors or future possessors of His kingdom:Matt. 21:33:  Hear another parable: There was a certain landowner who planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it, dug a winepress in it and built a tower. And he leased it to vinedressers and went into a far country. 34 Now when vintage-time drew near, he sent his servants to the vinedressers, that they might receive its fruit. 35 And the vinedressers took his servants, beat one, killed one, and stoned another. 36 Again he sent other servants, more than the first, and they did likewise to them. 37 Then last of all he sent his son to them, saying, They will respect my son. 38 But when the vinedressers saw the son, they said among themselves,  This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance. 39 So they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him.40 Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vinedressers?  41 They said to Him, He will destroy those wicked men miserably, and lease his vineyard to other vinedressers who will render to him the fruits in their seasons. 42 Jesus said to them, Have you never read in the Scriptures:The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone. This was the LORD s doing, And it is marvelous in our eyes.43 Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it. 44 And whoever falls on this stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder.  45 Now when the chief priests and Pharisees heard His parables, they perceived that He was speaking of them. 46 But when they sought to lay hands on Him, they feared the multitudes, because they took Him for a prophet. The parable is quite clear, and is explained by our Lord Himself. This was fulfilled when the Romans sacked Jerusalem in 70 A.D., and destroyed the Temple and its administration. This was the definitive end of the Old Testament dispensation, and fulfilled also the predictions of Luke 21. In response to the Jews, Christ says the kingdom of God will be taken from them because of the fact that they are going to murder him. Christ states unequivocally that the kingdom will be transferred to the Gentiles because of the rejection of Christ by the Jews.2. Our Lord commissioned the 12 Apostles to be the foundation stones of the New Israel, replacing what St. Paul calls  flesh Israel  or  Israel after the flesh. Luke 22:  28 But you [Apostles] are those who have continued with Me in My trials. 29 And I bestow upon you a kingdom, just as My Father bestowed one upon Me, 30 that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.So, our Lord has conferred upon the 12 the possession of the kingdom, and it is they and their successors (Luke 10:16, 1 Tim. 1:3-4), who will sit on thrones judging in this spiritual kingdom. Those who sit on these thrones are also their successors, the Bishops of the Church. This is why St. Paul can write in Eph. 2: 19 Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, 20 having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone, 21 in whom the whole building, being fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord, 22 in whom you also are being built together for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit. 3. Isn t it ironic that Hagee s church is named  cornerstone. It makes one wonder whether he meant Christ, the true cornerstone, or the Masonic  cornerstone  ceremony performed by masons at the erecting of a new lodge. And in case you think this is far fetched, consider what wikipedia states about Hagee in the entry under his name: Hagee was awarded the  Humanitarian of the Year  award by the San Antonio B nai B rith Council. It was the first time in the history of San Antonio that this award has been given to a Gentile. Dr. Hagee was presented the ZOA Israel Award by U.N. Ambassador Jean Kirkpatrick. This award was given by the Jewish Community of Dallas, Texas. He was presented the ZOA Service Award by Texas Governor Mark White. Houston Mayor Kathy Whitmire issued a special proclamation in his honor declaring Pastor John C. Hagee Day. Hagee has received numerous honors and accolades from national Jewish organizations for his support of Israel. For those that don t know, B nai B rith equates with Jewish Freemasonry. Could Hagee be a Zionist agent? It seems so.4. In response, it is the Catholic Church, and she alone, that is the building of God, the temple of God, the New Jerusalem, that is the kingdom of God built upon the foundation stones of all the Apostles, and it is this kingdom which can never fall. She alone has lasted 2000 years without changing her doctrines and without committing massive apostasy. This is why we see the name of an Apostle and the name of a tribe on each of the 12 foundation stones of the New Jerusalem in St. John s Apocalypse (Apoc. 21). The Cathoic Church has never repealed, though it has qualified the meaning of the inspired words of St. Paul in 1 Thess. 2: 14 For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus. For you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, just as they did from the Judeans, 15 who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they do not please God and are contrary to all men, 16 forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved, so as always to fill up the measure of their sins; but wrath has come upon them to the uttermost. And Christ Himself has no fear of being labelled  anti-semitic  (though He was, of course a semite!) when he calls Judaism a  synagogue of Satan,  in Apoc. 2:9 & 3:9).5. Is this racism? Anti-semitism? Absolutely not. Arabs are  semites  as much as Jews, and there are and have been millions of Arab Christians. What we are concerned with opposing here is an occult, racist philosophy Zionism, which is just as bad as  white supremacy  or the Black Panthers  ideology. Only by being incorporated into the God-man and His Body, the Church, can these petty, fleshly divisions be overcome, as St. Paul writes in Galatians 3:28-29. There we learn that the true descendants of Abraham are those who operate with the faith of Abraham, not racist pride. John Hagee is, in fact, the racist, who now worships the nation of Israel. Without Christ, there is no salvation. The flesh nation of Israel is cut off from the covenant and cannot attain to heaven without faith in Jesus. Let us look at an important allegory from St. Paul on this matter.Galatians 4:21 Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law? 22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman. 23 But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through promise, 24 which things are symbolic. For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar  25 for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children 26 but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all. 27 For it is written:Rejoice, O barren, You who do not bear! Break forth and shout, You who are not in labor! For the desolate has many more children Than she who has a husband. 28 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise. 29 But, as he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, even so it is now. 30 Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the forewoman. 31 So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free. 6. So, you see, there are only two covenants, and there have only ever been two covenants. One, symbolized by Mt. Sinai, which represents Judaism, and which cannot give life to those who seek to externally fulfill its precepts, and the New Covenant, which is the eternal covenant (Heb. 13:20), confirmed in the counsels of the Persons of the Trinity before the foundation of the world (Apoc. 13:8). This New Covenant is the covenant confirmed in Christ s Blood, which is the Eucharist celebrated at every Mass and Divine Liturgy throughout the world (Luke 22:20 with Jer. 31:31). The Old Testament saints themselves put their faith Christ not in Judaistic observances, as Jesus states in John 5:45-46, 8:56. Thus, He is the only way for Jew and Gentile alike (Acts 4:12). And, He only has one Church on earth that has faithfully maintained the traditions of the Apostles, both in Word and in Epistle (2 Thess. 2:15). Unfortunately, Hagee, like those who for a time believed in Christ in the first century and fell away as the writer of Hebrews mentions, Hagee has also has apostatized into Judaism because he is blind to the Spirit of Christ operative in the Old Testament. In other words, in this bad hermeneutic, one fails to understand typology. This is why St. Paul writes: 7 But if the ministry of death, written and engraved on stones, was glorious [the Old Covenant], so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of the glory of his countenance, which glory was passing away, 8 how will the ministry of the Spirit not be more glorious? 9 For if the ministry of condemnation had glory, the ministry of righteousness exceeds much more in glory. 10 For even what was made glorious had no glory in this respect, because of the glory that excels. 11 For if what is passing away was glorious, what remains is much more glorious. 12 Therefore, since we have such hope, we use great boldness of speech 13 unlike Moses, who put a veil over his face so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the end of what was passing away. 14 But their minds were blinded. For until this day the same veil remains uplifted in the reading of the Old Testament, because the veil is taken away in Christ. 15 But even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart. 16 Nevertheless when one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. 17 Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. 18 But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord. What could be clearer? The Old Covenant has been brought to fulfillment and fruition by the New. It (the Law alone) cannot save (and never could), and those who still adhere to it as the proper way to approach God are unfortunately blind to the types of Christ which are found throughout the Law (Luke 24:44). Christ is the true High Priest; Christ is the true Moses; Christ is the true inheritor of the Abrahamic promises; Christ is the fulfillment of the promise to David concerning a kingdom, and on and on. And, all of this is actualized at Christ s First Advent not at some fictitious, literal millennial kingdom in Jerusalem or Illinois. Thus, the kingdom is now (Col. 1:13), and it is the Church, and is ruled by His faithful Bishops abnd priests (Matt. 16:18 with 18:18).7. Consider the First Century writer, St. Clement of Rome, who was ordained by St. Peter wrote: Through countryside and city [the apostles] preached, and they appointed their earliest converts, testing them by the Spirit, to be the bishops and deacons of future believers. Nor was this a novelty, for bishops and deacons had been written about a long time earlier. . . . Our apostles knew through our Lord Jesus Christ that there would be strife for the office of bishop. For this reason, therefore, having received perfect foreknowledge, they appointed those who have already been mentioned and afterwards added the further provision that, if they should die, other approved men should succeed to their ministry  (Letter to the Corinthians 42:4 5, 44:1 3 [A.D. 80]). That s  apostolic succession. Or consider what St. Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, wrote in his Letter to the Smyrneans (ca 100 A.D.): CHAPTER VIII. LET NOTHING BE DONE WITHOUT THE BISHOP.See that ye all follow the bishop, even as Jesus Christ does the Father, and the presbytery as ye would the apostles; and reverence the deacons, as being the institution of God. Let no man do anything connected with the Church without the bishop. Let that be deemed a proper Eucharist, which is [administered] either by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude [of the people] also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church. It is not lawful without the bishop either to baptize or to celebrate a love-feast; but whatsoever he shall approve of, that is also pleasing to God, so that everything that is done may be secure and valid. St. Cyril of Jerusalem, in his Catechtical Lectures, Lectures 4 and 18, warns: Fall not away either into the sect of the Samaritans, or into Judaism: for Jesus Christ henceforth has ransomed you. Stand aloof from all observance of Sabbaths, and from calling any indifferent meats common or unclean. But especially abhor all the assemblies of wicked heretics; and in every way make your own soul safe, by fastings, prayers, almsgivings, and reading the oracles of God; that having lived the rest of your life in the flesh in soberness and godly doctrine, you may enjoy the one salvation which flows from Baptism; and thus enrolled in the armies of heaven by God and the Father, may also be deemed worthy of the heavenly crowns, in Christ Jesus our Lord, to Whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen. 25. Of old the Psalmist sang, Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, (ye that are) from the fountains of Israel. But after the Jews for the plots which they made against the Saviour were cast away from His grace, the Saviour built out of the Gentiles a second Holy Church, the Church of us Christians, concerning which he said to Peter, And upon this rock I will build My Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it Matthew 16:18 . And David prophesying of both these, said plainly of the first which was rejected, I have hated the Congregation of evil doers; but of the second which is built up he says in the same Psalm, Lord, I have loved the beauty of Your house; and immediately afterwards, In the Congregations will I bless you, O Lord. For now that the one Church in Judea is cast off, the Churches of Christ are increased over all the world; and of them it is said in the Psalms, Sing unto the Lord a new song, His praise in the Congregation of Saints. Agreeably to which the prophet also said to the Jews, I have no pleasure in you, says the Lord Almighty Malachi 1:10; and immediately afterwards, For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same, My name is glorified among the Gentiles. Concerning this Holy Catholic Church Paul writes to Timothy, That you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the House of God, which is the Church of the Living God, the pillar and ground of the truth 1 Timothy 3:15 . St. Athanasius, in his First Festal Letter, Sec. 8, writes: 8. Now observe; that city, since the coming of our Savior, has had an end, and all the land of the Jews has been laid waste; so that from the testimony of these things (and we need no further proof, being assured by our own eyes of the fact) there must, of necessity, be an end of the shadow. And not from me should these things be learned, but the sacred voice of the prophet foretold, crying;  Behold upon the mountains the feet of Him that brings good tidings, and publishes peace Nahum 1:15;  and what is the message he published, but that which he goes on to say to them,  Keep your feasts, O Judah; pay to the Lord your vows. For they shall no more go to that which is old; it is finished; it is taken away: He is gone up who breathed upon the face, and delivered you from affliction.  Now who is he that went up? a man may say to the Jews, in order that even the boast of the shadow may be done away; neither is it an idle thing to listen to the expression,  It is finished; he is gone up who breathed.  For nothing was finished before he went up who breathed. But as soon as he went up, it was finished. Who was he then, O Jews, as I said before? If Moses, the assertion would be false; for the people were not yet come to the land in which alone they were commanded to perform these rites. But if Samuel, or any other of the prophets, even in that case there would be a perversion of the truth; for hitherto these things were done in Judea, and the city was standing. For it was necessary that while that stood, these things should be performed. So that it was none of these, my beloved, who went up. But if you would hear the true matter, and be kept from Jewish fables, behold our Savior who went up, and  breathed upon the face, and said to His disciples, Receive the Holy Ghost John 20:22.  For as soon as these things were done, everything was finished, for the altar was broken, and the veil of the temple was rent; and although the city was not yet laid waste, the abomination was ready to sit in the midst of the temple, and the city and those ancient ordinances to receive their final consummation. Similarly, the 8th Canon of the Seventh Ecumenical Council (787 A.D.) states: Since certain, erring in the superstitions of the Hebrews, have thought to mock at Christ our God, and feigning to be converted to the religion of Christ do deny him, and in private and secretly keep the Sabbath and observe other Jewish customs, we decree that such persons be not received to communion, nor to prayers, nor into the Church; but let them be openly Hebrews according to their religion, and let them not bring their children to baptism, nor purchase or possess a slave. But if any of them, out of a sincere heart and in faith, is converted and makes profession with his whole heart, setting at naught their customs and observances, and so that others may be convinced and converted, such an one is to be received and baptized, and his children likewise; and let them be taught to take care to hold aloof from the ordinances of the Hebrews. But if they will not do this, let them in no wise be received. In conclusion, bad theology leads to worse theology, and often this is based in a faulty hermeneutic with false presuppositions. With Hagee, its a serious failure to recognize Christ in the Old Testament and typology. Both he and the Zionists are united in rejecting the teaching of the historic Orthodox Fathers. Heresy is like a virus that compounds itself. Premillennialism, dispensationalism, and its offshoot, the virtual worship of Israel, are serious errors that, when worked out to their illogical conclusions, end up denying Christ s divinity and/or necessity of faith in Him for salvation. Hagee demonstrates that.READ MORE SHADOW GOVERNMENT NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Shadow Government FilesTo hear Jay s full podcasts, see more information and learn how you can become a subscriber to JaysAnalysis.Jay Dyer is the author of the forthcoming title, Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults and Symbols in Film from Trine Day.

23226,FALSE PROFITS: The U.S. Military’s War Over Russia,"21st Century Wire says We ve said it many times during the last two years here at 21WIRE and on the SUNDAY WIRE radio show   that the present anti-Russia hysteria being rolled out in the US and Britain is simply a cheap facade to gin up a new arms race.  Not small ticket items, but big ticket items   including the next generation of  next generation tactical nuclear weapons. The only problem is: the out-of-control rhetoric, mixed with Washington s careless and belligerent military posturing  might inadvertently lead to belligerent military action.Watch US Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley last week, threatening to  destroy any enemy, anytime,  meaning Russia.. General Milley performed his duty for the corporations. All smiles at the AGM. Indeed, business has never been better. Bravo, encore!  says Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, General Dynamics, BAE Systems, Airbus and General Electric.When will it end? How much profit is enough for the US  defense  industry?The sad truth: it s never enough  Mark Perry PoliticoDuring the Battle of the Wilderness in 1864, a unit of Robert E. Lee s army rolled up some artillery pieces and began shelling the headquarters of Union commander Ulysses S. Grant. When one of his officers pleaded that Grant move, insisting that he knew exactly what Lee was going to do, Grant, normally a taciturn man, lost his temper:  Oh, I am heartily tired of hearing about what Lee is going to do,  he said.  Some of you always seem to think he is going to turn a double somersault, and land in our rear and on both of our flanks at the same time. Go back to your command and try to think what we are going to do ourselves, instead of what Lee is going to do. The story was recalled to me a few weeks ago by a senior Pentagon officer in citing the April 5 testimony of Army leaders before a Senate Armed Services Subcommittee. The panel delivered a grim warning about the future of the U.S. armed forces: Unless the Army budget was increased, allowing both for more men and more materiel, members of the panel said, the United States was in danger of being  outranged and outgunned  in the next war and, in particular, in a confrontation with Russia. Vladimir Putin s military, the panel averred, had outstripped the U.S. in modern weapons capabilities. And the Army s shrinking size meant that  the Army of the future will be too small to secure the nation.  It was a sobering assessment delivered by four of the most respected officers in the Army including Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, his service s leading intellectual. The claim is the prevailing view among senior Army officers, who fear that Army readiness and modernization programs are being weakened by successive cuts to the U.S. defense budget.But not everyone was buying it. This is the  Chicken-Little, sky-is-falling  set in the Army,  the senior Pentagon officer said. These guys want us to believe the Russians are 10 feet tall. There s a simpler explanation: The Army is looking for a purpose, and a bigger chunk of the budget. And the best way to get that is to paint the Russians as being able to land in our rear and on both of our flanks at the same time. What a crock. ( ) The fight over the Army panel s testimony is the latest example of a deepening feud in the military community over how to respond to shrinking budget numbers. At issue is the military s strategic future: Facing cuts, will the Army opt to modernize its weapons  arsenal, or defer modernization in favor of increased numbers of soldiers? On April 5, the Army s top brass made its choice clear: It wants to do both, and Russia s the reason. But a growing chorus of military voices says that demand is both backward and dangerously close-minded that those same senior military officers have not only failed to understand the lessons of Afghanistan and Iraq and embrace service reform, they are inflating foreign threats to win a bigger slice of the defense budget Continue this story at Politico.comREAD MORE RUSSIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Russia Files",Middle-east,"October 18, 2016"

23228,How the FBI Creates ‘Domestic Terror’ in the United States,"21st Century Wire says This is a bit of an oddity as far as TED talks go Investigative journalist Trevor Aaronson actually delivers a TED presentation which calls out the FBI for being the party responsible for creating the majority of so-called  domestic terror  and  Islamic terror  busts in the US since 9/11.Just this week, the FBI are boasting of a high level domestic extremist terror bust of a militia group in Kansas, but when you read the fine print of the case, it features several FBI  confidential informants,  no doubt helping to  egg-on  and steer their prey into a preconceived trap.21WIRE has been saying this for years, and it s refreshing to see what is normally a bland, mainstream talking shop like TED actually allow a speaker to present a real anti-establishment subject like this one.In truth, the FBI s shady record in this area stretched back well before 9/11, when FBI informants (under FBI supervision) helped to organize the 1993 World Trade Center Bombing. Despite this, idiotic mainstream media and politicians in the US still claim that the 1993 WTC event was  linked to al Qaeda. NOTE: The following speaker Trevor Aaronson claims that both the Boston Bombing and the attempted Times Square car bombing. This statement is very likely to be incorrect. It has already been confirmed that the FBI s lead suspect in Boston, Tamerlan Tsarnaev was being active recruited by the FBI for at least two years prior to the event in question, as well as being associated with a CIA front org called the Jamestown Foundation. Similarly, the alleged Times Square bomber, Faisal Shahzad, appeared to have fled to Pakistan with a handler who has connections to the CIA and MI6. Otherwise, we welcome this topic raised by journalist Aaronson.Brasscheck TVGuess who is behind more terrorist incidents in the US than al-Qaeda, al-Shabaab and ISIS combined?The FBI   and when given the change to set the record straight, they don t dispute it.As  law enforcement  scams go, this is one of the most reprehensible. The FBI finds mentally ill people, puts ideas into their heads, works up plans for them and then gives them the money to carry them out   an then arrests them for terrorist plots.They then declare victory in the  war on terror. Domestic anti-terrorism efforts cost $100 billion a year or $1 trillion per decade.And you, your kids and grand kids pay for all this in the form of a reduced standard of living to make sure this useless anti-American scum get nice big paychecks and bloated tax-payer guaranteed pensions for their years of  service.

23230,"US-Saudi Plan: Let 9,000 ISIS Fighters Walk Free from Mosul – to Fight in Syria"," Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireJudging by both the words, and deeds of the Obama White House and its political  diplomatic  appointees led by perfidious John Kerry and caustic Samantha Power   all evidence to date points to the US wanting to escalate its war on Syria   while happily baiting a military confrontation, and World War  scenario with Russia and its allies in the process. If this latest leak is indeed true   and time will certainly tell whether or not it is, it would constitute one of the most egregious violations of both US and international law   by the United States government and its theocratic dictator partner in Saudi Arabia.Washington s own anti-terror legislation expressly forbids colluding to provide logistical or material support for terrorist groups, and this US-Saudi venture would be the latest in a long list of violations  According to news released today (see report below), US President Barack Obama has been briefed that the operation to liberate the ISIS stronghold in Mosul in Iraq is scheduled for the second half of October. Here s what makes this a potential shocker: the operation allows for safe passage for 9,000 ISIS fighters on the proviso that they are transferred from Iraq to eastern Syria in order to help US plans for  regime change  there. At the time of the assault, coalition aircraft would strike only on a pre-agreed detached buildings in the city, which are empty, the source said. According to him [the source], the plan of Washington and Riyadh also provides that the rebels move from Mosul to Syria for the attack on the government-controlled town of troops. Essentially, Washington and Saudi Arabia, will allow 9,000 ISIS (Islamic State) fighter FREE passage into Syria if they agree to join Washington s  regime change  operations there. This could also include,   eastern regions of Syria to follow a major offensive operation, which involves the capture of Deir ez-Zor and Palmyra,  the source added.Before you write this story off as some ornate Russian psychological operation, consider the long trend arch. The US along with its generous Gulf sidekicks, have already established a solid track record of aiding and abetting ISIS   not just in Syria, but in Iraq too.The record shows that the US is guilty on a number of counts If the Mosul leak is true, then it wouldn t be the first time that the US has provided cover in the military pantomime the world has come to know as  the fight against ISIS.  When large ISIS convoys crossed the Syrian desert to invade and occupy the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra in May 2015, the US  Coalition  airforce did nothing, and allowed ISIS to take and destroy part of the world s great historic cultural heritage, along with the murder of scores of innocent civilians.Professor Tim Anderson from Sydney University states: U.S. weapons with Israeli ammunition were used by Islamic State group when taking over Palmyra. The extremists also had U.S. military rations. The U.S., which since 2014 claimed to be conducting a war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and which had air power and sophisticated surveillance of the region, did nothing to stop the huge ISIS advance on Palmyra. The US isn t even shy about its laissez-faire policy with ISIS in the field, with the New York Times openly boasting,  Any airstrikes against Islamic State militants in and around Palmyra would probably benefit the forces of President Bashar al-Assad. So far, United States-led airstrikes in Syria have largely focused on areas far outside government control, to avoid the perception of aiding a leader whose ouster President Obama has called for. Following the derelict incident, New York Times reporters Hwaida Saad and Kareem Fahim, were still kicking and screaming for  regime change like petulant children at the news of ISIS fleeing and Palmyra being liberated by the Syrian Army and Russians. They said that,  Mr. Assad s contention that his government is a bulwark against the transnational extremist group  has been bolstered, but added that  his foes and some allies argue that he must leave power as part of a political settlement to end the war in Syria. In other words:  we still want regime change!  This says volumes about who is really enforcing New York Times editorial lines (either the US State Dept, or the CIA, take your pick).More importantly however, is what kind of message an US statement like that sends to ISIS, as well as Al Nusra and other terrorist brigades inside Syria, which is basically,  we do not need to worry about US air strikes, only Syrian Army and Russian strikes.  This situation really sums up the utter fraud and contempt of the US deception in Syria, and it s no surprise that the Russian Foreign Ministry are reticent to extend themselves any more where the US is concerned.Then, in March 2016, when ISIS fled Palmyra, back across the desert towards Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa   the great and powerful US  Coalition  airforce actually helped ISIS in a number of ways, including allowing them free passage once more.In late August, we were told that the Turkish Army, alongside  allied Syrian rebels  (terrorist group Faylaq al-Sham) backed by the US air cover, invaded Syria in order to capture the  ISIS-held  town of Jarabulus, Syria, this supposedly to cut off ISIS s last open route into Turkey. But what happened to ISIS?The NYT even admitted that,  it appeared that most of the militants had fled without a fight. Here, ISIS appears to have been given advanced warning   by either US or Turkish intelligence, as they left the contested town of Jarabulus quietly, but in droves. In reality, Turkey twisted this operation in order to attack and degrade Kurdish militias including the US-backed artificial construct called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), and pro-Kurdish People s Protection Units (YPG) and Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), the Syrian affiliate of the militant Kurdistan Workers  Party (PKK) in Iraq and Turkey   all of whom are meant to be fighting ISIS. Instead, they are now busy dodging Turkish artillery rounds. Confusing, yes, but true nonetheless.It s also common knowledge now, that top of the line US weaponry is being used by ISIS, both in Iraq, in Afghanistan and in Syria as well. In fact, if not for US weapons and supplies (along with US air intervention, or noninterventions), ISIS would have struggled to maintain many of the strategic positions it enjoys today. For the last 3 years, US officials have been dodging this issue, and when they do admit this is true, their patronizing party line is that,  this must be a mistake, if they do have US weapons, we didn t mean it.  As if the world was born yesterday.Perhaps the most flagrant violation by the US-led forces in aiding and abetting ISIS took place on Sept 17, 2016, when the US-led Coalition bombed Syrian Army positions outside of Deir ez-Zor near al-Tharda Mountain, killing some 80 soldiers and injuring 100 more.  As if by design, an ISIS offensive began immediately following the US massacre of Syrian soldiers. Clearly, this bold move by the Pentagon paved the way for a major ISIS advance.To any normal observer, the US attack was a belligerent act of war that effective destroyed an already fragile bilateral ceasefire agreement, and yet the US response was to somehow blame Russia for calling an emergency UNSC meeting to discuss the incident. Judging by this response, it s pretty clear that US wants to see the Syrian Conflict carry on for a while, and it will need groups like ISIS to make that happen. The other problem with Washington s hollow righteousness in the Middle East is that there are key members of the US-led Coalition  who are financing ISIS, Al Nusra Front, Nour al Din Zinki, and Arar al Sham (all  moderate terrorists we re told) militants in Syria, Iraq and beyond. This fact was recently admitted by former US Secretary of State and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, as revealed in this week s batch of Wikileaks emails. Clinton writes: While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region. Add to that the multiple exposures over the last 3 years of the US CIA illegally trafficking lethal arms to Al Nusra and other terrorists through covert operations like Timber Sycamore.Still, US and NATO member state officials and their media gatekeepers continue to deny it and play dumb, rather than come clean that the United States and its  partners  in the region are helping, not hindering ISIS terrorism.Some might ask: why would they do a thing like that? By now, the answer should be simple, but threefold:What s so comical yet even more tragic, is how prominent the topic of  ISIS  factors into all of the vapid  national security  debates and media panels in this year s US Presidential election, and in the dumbed-down  coverage of the delusional US mainstream media, led by Pentagon surrogate CNN, and hopeless FOX News. Judging by their prosaic  coverage , neither the networks, nor Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump have the slightest clue of what the reality on the ground is. Instead we here,  My ISIS plan is better than yours!  The US political conversation has gone beyond ridiculousness.The corps of US military and CIA media spokesman aren t much better. The sad part is some of them do know what is really happening, but would rather lie to the American public.With so much double dealing, who can you trust? Certainly not anyone in Washington.More on the White House s latest dangerous proposition .RTThe US and Saudi Arabia have agreed to grant free passage to thousands of Islamic State militants before the Iraqi city of Mosul is stormed. The jihadists will be redeployed to fight against the government in Syria, a military-diplomatic source told RIA Novosti. More than 9,000 Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS, ISIL) militants will be redeployed from Mosul to the eastern regions of Syria to carry out a major offensive operation, which involves capturing Deir ez-Zor and Palmyra,  the source said.According to the anonymous diplomatic source, US President Barack Obama has already sanctioned an operation to liberate Mosul, due to take place in October.During the storm of the city in northern Iraq the US-led coalition s planes would only strike detached, vacated or uninhabited buildings, while keeping terrorists as targets, he said.In September, US Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter confirmed that Washington would send an additional 600 troops to Iraq to help liberate Mosul at the request of the local authorities.The source suggested that redeployment of IS militants is necessary because  Washington must somehow counter Russia s achievements in Syria, try to diminish their importance. Apart from the purely political dividends, the other purpose of this operation, obviously, will be to discredit the success of Russian Airspace forces. And, of course, it s an attempt to undermine Syrian President (Bashar) Assad,  he said.The leadership of Saudi Arabia s General Intelligence Directorate will be the mediators and guarantors of the agreement on safe passage for the jihadists from Mosul, he claimed.The source added that a similar scheme had been used by the US and its allies during the liberation of the Iraqi city of Fallujah Continue this story at RTREAD MORE SYRIA NEWS: 21st Century Wire Syria FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"October 13, 2016"

23232,Stuck on Stupid: Why is America Starting WW3?,"SARTRE 21st Century WireEvery day the world moves closer to a nuclear winter. The finger on the trigger presses upon the button and only a slight movement will launch unthinkable destruction.The point that it is so unthinkable yet so close to happening is caused by the overwhelming denial that Americans have towards the real nature of international brinksmanship. The United State foreign policy for global dominance cannot be defended as a righteous imperative. Those who naively believe that NATO occupies the high moral ground are just as confused as the dupes that cheer the dough boys or the GI s in the previous two world wars.The difference in the coming end of days is not that the foolish deployments and menacing circumstances are not known, but that the ultimate consequences and inevitable desolation is simply ignored. When a nation is oblivious to the lessons of history and the reality of insane actions, a rational foreign policy becomes the first causality of national security.Evaluate the titanic failures in the Middle East; Iraq, Egypt, Libya, Turkey, Yemen are well documented as benefiting only a greater Israel, a stronger Iran and a more bellicose Saudi Arabia.Yet the major confrontation with Russia over the Syrian civil war has raised the stakes to Armageddon proportions. Of course the international press wants to avoid any serious discussion on the basis of the  so called  authority that the United States has to bomb the Syrian government back to the Stone Age or even more important to deflect that Russia was invited into the conflict by the President of Syria, Bashar al-Assad. Perpetual warfare without declaring a constitutional war has become the norm in the post World War II environment. No doubt, there will never be a Congressional declaration before the ICBM birds fly. WWIII  is closer to occurring than ever before.Don t be sucked into the military-industrial-complex mindset that Russia is the belligerent behind the coming cataclysm. Remember the actual facts about the coup and who was behind the removal of Viktor Yanukovych in Ukraine. Read between the lines in this Washington Post report: Ousted Ukraine president warns of civil war, criticizes U.S. for aiding current government. Yanukovych, who read from a statement in Russian and did not take questions, accused the West and the United States of backing fascists in Ukraine   another regular allegation being made by Russian authorities. There is a gang of ultranationalists and fascists operating the government,  he said.  I would like to ask those who cover for these dark forces in the West: Are you blind? Have you forgotten what fascism is? Do you recall that NATO is encircling Russia with an unprecedented military buildup? Romanian minister: US anti-missile interceptors will be deployed in 2015, and Lithuania aims to spend $115m on air-defense system amid NATO build-up in Eastern Europe and Deployment of U.S. Missiles in Poland Anti-Russian Move  are just a few examples of NATO s expansion into Eastern Europe with the distinct intention of bringing Russia into the globalist New World Order sphere of domination.( ) Is this the end results from Obama Firing of Military Reminiscent of Stalin s Purge or is it a change in military doctrine to employ the George Armstrong Custer battlefield strategy, when taking on the Ruskies? At least Field Marshal Paulus surrendered at Stalingrad. Sounds like Milley will be directing his troops from an undisclosed bunker, while the rest of us incinerate.If you are still in doubt that the supreme lunacy is upon us, read the detailed explanation about the 8 Alarming Warning Signs That Indicate War With Russia Could Be Imminent.The brick need not be shattered into an irreversible carnage. But before levelheaded minds can revamp the tensions from failed policies, one needs to understand just what this confrontation is all about. Can the simple minds of a dumb down society face up to reality or are they satisfied to die in a contrived holocaust because the globalist controlled State Department are packed with Zionist NeoCons, who are quite willing to endure World War III to destroy Western Civilization?Mark 8:18 states it clearly: Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?Obviously, the public does not see the deception, nor are they able to perceive the falsehoods from the media propaganda, and they certainly do not remember the real nature of the diabolic enemy behind the globalist plan for destroying any nation that opposes capitulation and integration into the New World Order.Being absorbed into the coordinated assault on Donald Trump, the entire establishment exposes itself to be the obedient enablers of the globalist cabal, hell bent on eradicating any opposition to their rule. If you have not already read, National Referendum on the Globalist Establishment, please do.Once this staged and rigged theater is over the end result will cast the forces of oppression against the populist sentiment to become independent and sovereign. The military will not be lead by the mythical Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper concerned about maintaining the national precious bodily fluids, but will be commanded by modern day Air Marshal Arthur Harris, who was as much a war criminal as any NAZI SS fanatic.Humanity is systemically stupid. People simply cannot bring themselves to admit that their society is ruled by dedicated demonic sociopaths. Challenging Russia on the field of war is about as mad as the very MAD strategic nuclear doctrine that the real Dr, Strangelove, Robert McNamara pushed to the threshold of annihilation.The single most compelling certainty is that Russia has always built their foreign policy around an extensive civil defense network that protects millions of their population. The United States has left exposed their entire civilian population as a conscious decision that millions would inevitably be killed in a full exchange of hydrogen bomb weapons.Stable, cogent and balanced individuals know these conclusions are true. Regrettably, none of us are in the loop of influencing policy, much less in positions of authority to reverse the unwarranted confrontation with Russia.General George S. Patton was correct in advocating deposing Stalin and the evil Soviet Union at the end of WWII, but the circumstances are reversed today. Since the end of those international finance inspired hostilities, the American empire has pursued a crusade to do the bidding of the NWO banksters cartel of imperialists.Vladimir Putin Nemesis of the New World Order is the overriding motivation for invoking an absurd cause that can only lead to the unthinkable. The fact that this outcome has now become conceivable if not alluring, illustrates the delusional disease that has taken over the establishment that operates in a fantasy existence of computer simulations and probabilities assessments.The military planning scenarios played by the Pentagon are infinitely more deadly than playing with the WOPR (War Operation Plan Response) computer in War Games. President Obama, Secretary of State Kerry and an aspiring President Hillary Clinton are certifiably insane to set into motion a warmongering conflict that threatens all of humanity.The American people are being held hostage to a globalism of destruction. Any country resisting the worldwide monopoly of elite s dominion must be conquered or destroyed. The United States has already been captured.

23233,SPECTRE OF BENGHAZI: DOJ Drops Charges Against Alleged Arms Dealer of Libyan Weapons,"21st Century Wire says The US Department of Justice (DOJ) is dropping all charges against an arms dealer whose weapons made it into the hands of radical Libya militants.Early this week a motion was filed by the DOJ to drop charges against an American arms dealer named Marc Turi, according to federal court records obtained by Politico.Also according to Politico: The deal averts a trial that threatened to cast additional scrutiny on Hillary Clinton s private emails as Secretary of State, and to expose reported Central Intelligence Agency attempts to arm rebels fighting Libyan leader Moammar Qadhafi.   LIBYA FALLOUT    (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)In the book entitled Definitive Report by both Jack Murphy (Army Green Beret) and Brandon Webb (Navy SEAL), a close friend of Glen Doherty (one of the Americans killed during the Benghazi siege) it was revealed that Obama s former deputy NSA advisor and current CIA director, John Brennan had been directing covert black-ops in Libya as well as other parts in North Africa, prior to the siege that left four Americans dead at a compound in Benghazi.Brennan s covert operations were said to have  prompted retaliation  inside the compound in Libya   as former CIA director David Petraeus had been blackmailed into resignation by senior CIA officials.All of this information was preceded by a massive cover-up involving mainstream media, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Susan Rice and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, both of whom initially blamed the siege on a heavily propagandized YouTube film entitled,  The Innocence of Muslims.  This meme was spread on many major talk shows even though evidence failed to connect the film to the attack.In addition, the White House and President Barack Obama had many inconsistencies in their talking points about Benghazi, first labeling it a terror attack, then quickly shifting gears, denying that there were Al Qaeda operatives anywhere near the compound.US Ambassador Christopher Stevens was said to have helped manage a large gun-running operation from the  Special Mission Compound  in Benghazi, as he was also said to have helped ship guns to  al-Qaeda-linked opposition  to assist in the takedown of former dictator Moammar Gadhafi.In a Business Insider report from October of 2012, the Benghazi story dovetailed the growing proxy war in Syria: In March 2011 Stevens became the official U.S. liaison to the al-Qaeda-linked Libyan opposition, working directly with Abdelhakim Belhadj of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group   a group that has now disbanded, with some fighters reportedly participating in the attack that took Stevens  life.In November 2011 The Telegraph reported that Belhadj, acting as head of the Tripoli Military Council,  met with Free Syrian Army [FSA] leaders in Istanbul and on the border with Turkey  in an effort by the new Libyan government to provide money and weapons to the growing insurgency in Syria. As 21WIRE has previously reported in 2014,  It s worth noting here: like Libya s new militant governor of Tripoli, Abdel Hakim Belhadj, the Chechen terrorist group Kata ib Mohadzherin s leader Airat Vakhitov was also under US supervision for years  imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba circa 2002, after being captured by U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Both were Belhadj and Vakhitov were released by the Pentagon only to be repatriated in the field again   back into fighting regions to organise al Qaeda-type Islamist groups   both active in countries which the US and NATO have been actively vying for regime change   in Libya and Syria, respectively. You can draw your own conclusions here about what Guantanamo is in reality, a fact which was confirmed by thePenny Lane leaks regarding the recruitment of double agents out of Gitmo. Interestingly, in a NY Times article from December of 2012 entitled, U.S.-Approved Arms for Libya Rebels Fell Into Jihadis  Hands,  we see an acknowledgement of an arms shipment at the behest of the Obama administration under the watchful eye of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton   but the mainstream media appears to have provided cover for the White House and State Department by blaming Qatar for the weapons transfer to militants: The Obama administration secretly gave its blessing to arms shipments to Libyan rebels from Qatar last year, but American officials later grew alarmed as evidence grew that Qatar was turning some of the weapons over to Islamic militants, according to United States officials and foreign diplomats.No evidence has emerged linking the weapons provided by the Qataris during the uprising against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi to the attack that killed four Americans at the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, in September.But in the months before, the Obama administration clearly was worried about the consequences of its hidden hand in helping arm Libyan militants, concerns that have not previously been reported. The weapons and money from Qatar strengthened militant groups in Libya, allowing them to become a destabilizing force since the fall of the Qaddafi government. The spectre of Benghazi looms large when connecting the Middle Eastern dots over the past five years.More from Zero Hedge below   TRAIL OF BLOOD    Many questions about 2012 s Benghazi terror siege remain unanswered. (Image Source: foxnews)DOJ Drops Charges Against Arms Dealer Who  Threatened To Expose  Hillary Arming Islamic ExtremistsZero HedgeIn what would under other circumstances likely be a major media spectacle, Politico reported that the Obama administration is moving to dismiss charges against an arms dealer whom it had accused of selling weapons destined for Libyan rebels and who had threatened to expose Hillary Clinton s talks about arming anti-Qaddafi rebels.According to a motion filed in federal court in Phoenix, the DOJ on Monday filed a motion to drop the case against the arms dealer, an American named Marc Turi. One potential reason for the surprising move is that as Politico writes, the deal averts a trial that threatened to cast additional scrutiny on Hillary Clinton s private emails as Secretary of State, and to expose reported Central Intelligence Agency attempts to arm rebels fighting Libyan leader Moammar Qadhafi.Turi was indicted in 2014 on four felony counts: two of arms dealing in violation of the Arms Export Control Act and two of lying to the State Department in official applications. The charges accused Turi of claiming that the weapons involved were destined for Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, when the arms were actually intended to reach Libya. Turi s lawyers argued that the shipments were part of a U.S. government-authorized effort to arm Libyan rebels. It s unclear if any of the weapons made it to Libya, and there s no evidence linking weapons provided by the U.S. government to the Benghazi attacks.According to Politico government lawyers were facing a Wednesday deadline to produce documents to Turi s legal team, and the trial was officially set to begin on Election Day, although it likely would have been delayed by protracted disputes about classified information in the case. A Turi associate asserted that the government dropped the case because the proceedings could have embarrassed Clinton and President Barack Obama by calling attention to the reported role of their administration in supplying weapons that fell into the hands of Islamic extremist militants.Making matters worse, Turi s case had delved into emails sent to and from the controversial private account that Clinton used as Secretary of State, which the defense planned to harness at any trial. They don t want this stuff to come out because it will look really bad for Obama and Clinton just before the election,  said the associate.Leery of admitting the actual truth, in the dismissal motion, prosecutors were vague saying that  discovery rulings  from U.S. District Court Judge David Campbell contributed to the decision to drop the case. The joint motion asks the judge to accept a confidential agreement to resolve the case through a civil settlement between the State Department and the arms broker.This story continues at Zero Hedge READ MORE ISIS NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire ISIS Files   READ MORE LIBYA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Libya FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"October 5, 2016"

23236,"Yahoo caves in to NSA, FBI – and secretly monitors customer email accounts for US Gov’t","21st Century Wire says This will rank as one of the most egregious miscarriages of consumer trust in US history. In a brief statement to Reuters, according to these Silicon Valley executives: Yahoo is a law-abiding company, and complies with the laws of the United States.  Actually, Yahoo is in breach of the law. The  laws  they think they are talking about do not allow for flipping a  dead switch  on the 4th Amendment and conducting mass surveillance on all US citizens.In reality, the US Constitution is meant to be the supreme law of the land and Yahoo just colluded with an out of control US federal government   to trash the 4th Amendment.So who is Marissa Mayer, the Yahoo CEO who willingly colluded behind closed doors with the NSA and the FBI to submit all of Yahoo s customer base to unwarranted surveillance? Why was this 37 year old neophyte allowed to walk into the top spot from Google with no real managerial experience, and put in charge of such a large corporation   and then given a $54 million golden parachute after this dark spying debacle? She has quickly amassed net worth of approximately $500 million   half a billion dollars.It sounds like she was definitely  hand-picked  for this particular job  SELL OUT: Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer sold out her customer base to an out of control, data-hungry Federal government.The GuardianYahoo last year secretly built a custom software program to search all of its customers  incoming emails for specific information provided by US intelligence officials, sources have told Reuters.The company complied with a classified US government directive, scanning hundreds of millions of Yahoo Mail accounts at the behest of the National Security Agency (NSA) or FBI, according to two former employees and a third person who knew about the program.Some surveillance experts said this represents the first known case of a US internet company agreeing to a spy agency s demand by searching all arriving messages, as opposed to examining stored messages or scanning a small number of accounts in real time.It is not known what information intelligence officials were looking for, only that they wanted Yahoo to search for a set of characters. That could mean a phrase in an email or an attachment, said the sources.Reuters was unable to determine what data Yahoo may have handed over, if any, and whether intelligence officials had approached other email providers besides Yahoo with this kind of request.According to the two former employees, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer s decision to obey the directive troubled some senior executives and led to the June 2015 departure of the chief information security officer, Alex Stamos, who now heads security at Facebook.( ) Andrew Crocker, staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that the use of the word  directive  to describe the program indicated that the request may have been ordered under the section 702 of the 2008 Fisa Amendments Act, which allows the government to target non-US citizens abroad for surveillance.Revelations by Edward Snowden about the Prism and Upstream programs   of which the Yahoo program looks like a hybrid, Crocker said   show that US citizens were also subject to mass surveillance. The fourth amendment and attendant privacy concerns are quite staggering,  Crocker said.  It sounds like they are scanning all emails, even inside the US   the fourth amendment protects that fully. It s hard to see how the government justifies requiring Yahoo to search emails like that; there is no warrant that could possibly justify scanning all emails Continue this story at The GuardianREAD MORE SCI-TECH NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Sci-Tech Files ",Middle-east,"October 5, 2016"

In his statement, he reiterated the incredible workload that he and his team have in vetting all the information in their possession before it s released. Wikileaks also has to be careful in order to preserve the integrity of the leaks, but also to organize and catalogue the information for press and public consumption.Assange has since indicated that waves of documents will now be revealed in a time-released fashion, with some items dumped each week, right up until the US election on November 8th.When asked during his Berlin videocast about what the impact might be based on his knowledge of the information, Assange simply relied: We think they re significant.

23238,AGITPROP MACHINE: How the US create Fake Al Qaeda and ISIS videos,"Shawn Helton 21st Century WireFollowing the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the Pentagon reportedly paid PR firm Bell Pottinger $540 million to produce fake terror videos used to steer Western political interests.If this latest report by the The Bureau of Investigative Journalism is accurate, the public is once again privy to another startling example of how deep-state social engineering impacts and propels larger geopolitical war campaigning.This latest Pentagon public relations scandal comes after an onslaught of summertime war propaganda images were found to have been fabricated by the George Soros and US-UK government-backed pseudo NGO known as The White Helmets.   WAR GAMES    (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)As 21WIRE recently reported,  Like so many celebrated attributes of the lauded White Helmets, the rescue numbers are clearly exaggerated. The so-called rebel-held  territories (in actuality, terrorist-held areas) in which the White Helmets exclusively operate, have very few civilians remaining in them. The majority of Syrian civilians have fled terrorist-held enclaves like East Aleppo into government protected areas like West Aleppo  a fact that is routinely glossed over by western media outlets because it runs counter to the storyline being pushed by the US and UK government, both of whom are funding the White Helmets. The creation of all of this modern day agitprop has most certainly contributed to an environment of confusion, fear and uncertainty in the War On Terror era   no doubt costing many lives in the process.  REPUTATION LAUNDERING    The controversial PR firm Bell Pottinger Group. (Image Source: mmbiztoday)The Pentagon, Pottinger & Fake TerrorAccording to The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, there was a secretive operation between Bell Pottinger and those in high-level security working with the Pentagon to create al Qaeda terror videos as well as influence global media outlets through various propaganda: The Pentagon gave a controversial UK PR firm over half a billion dollars to run a top secret propaganda programme in Iraq, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism can reveal.Bell Pottinger s output included short TV segments made in the style of Arabic news networks and fake insurgent videos which could be used to track the people who watched them, according to a former employee.The agency s staff worked alongside high-ranking US military officers in their Baghdad Camp Victory headquarters as the insurgency raged outside. Bell Pottinger s former chairman Lord Tim Bell, confirmed the shocking story with the Sunday Times, who worked alongside with the Bureau to uncover covert operations which were covered by various secrecy agreements,  and  The London-based PR agency was brought into Iraq soon after the US invasion. In March 2004 it was tasked by the country s temporary administration with the  promotion of democratic elections    a  high-profile activity  which it trumpeted in its annual report. Also according the former chairman Bell, Bell Pottinger reported to the Pentagon, the CIA and the National Security Council on its work in Iraq. In total, over half a billion dollars was spent on the creation of various psychological operations crafted by the Pentagon and Bell Pottinger. Additionally, the Bureau tracked Pottinger s work through US army contracting censuses, federal procurement transaction records and reports by the Department of Defense (DoD),  interviewing  half a dozen former officials and contractors involved in information operations in Iraq. The Bureau has identified transactions worth $540 million between the Pentagon and Bell Pottinger for information operations and psychological operations on a series of contracts issued from May 2007 to December 2011. A similar contract at around the same annual rate   $120 million   was in force in 2006, we have been told. According to Martin Wells, a freelance video editor who worked with Bell Pottinger to create the secretive Pentagon propaganda: The third and most sensitive programme described by Wells was the production of fake al Qaeda propaganda films. He told the Bureau how the videos were made. He was given precise instructions:  We need to make this style of video and we ve got to use al Qaeda s footage,  he was told.  We need it to be 10 minutes long, and it needs to be in this file format, and we need to encode it in this manner. US marines would take the CDs on patrol and drop them in the chaos when they raided targets. Wells said:  If they re raiding a house and they re going to make a mess of it looking for stuff anyway, they d just drop an odd CD there. The CDs were set up to use Real Player, a popular media streaming application which connects to the internet to run. Wells explained how the team embedded a code into the CDs which linked to a Google Analytics account, giving a list of IP addresses where the CDs had been played. The tracking account had a very restricted circulation list, according to Wells: the data went to him, a senior member of the Bell Pottinger management team, and one of the US military commanders. QUESTION: Were the CD terror video productions a new form of Cold War-style propaganda leaflet, serving to rouse the populace, or were they only for planting fabricated evidence?Apparently, it s both. And there s the third function: to collect I.P. addresses of anyone who viewed the CD while connected to the internet.The Daily Beast reported that the Pentagon acknowledged their working relationship with Pottinger: The Pentagon confirmed that Bell Pottinger did work for them as a contractor in Iraq under the Information Operations Task Force (IOTF), producing some material that was openly sourced to coalition forces, and some which was not. They insisted that all material put out by IOTF was  truthful. IOTF was not the only mission Bell Pottinger worked on however. Wells said some Bell Pottinger work was carried out under the Joint Psychological Operations Task Force (JPOTF), which a U.S. defense official confirmed.The official said he could not comment in detail on JPOTF activities, adding  We do not discuss intelligence gathering methods for operations past and present. According Wells, some of the clandestine projects went even higher up in Washington.  If [Petraeus] couldn t sign off on it, it would go on up the line to the White House, and it was signed off up there, and the answer would come back down the line . In 2011, former US General David Petraeus served as director of the CIA from September of 20111 to November of 2012   resigning after illegally providing classified material to his biographer Paula Broadwell, with whom he was having an affair.While the Bureau of Investigative Journalism claims appear to confirm the fever-pitch of  War On Terror  propaganda witnessed almost daily now   one should also note that the Bureau has also been awarded by Amnesty International, a military industrial complex connected so-called human rights group, in addition to working with the dubious Qatari-GCC linked media organization, Al Jazzera. The Bureau also suffered a huge reputation dent in 2012 over the BBC-Lord McAlpine affair. However, the Bureau seems to have gone through a revamp of sorts and did recently hire Meirion Jones as an Investigations Editor. Jones is best known for his investigation into the Jimmy Saville abuse scandal which was compounded by a BBC cover-up scandal.Fake ISIS Video Used by US MediaOn a comparative note, in February of 2015, terror analysis experts concluded that ISIS video footage appearing to show the executions of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians was indeed a faked.According to Florida-based Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium, the on camera murders of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians purported to have been decapitated   were ruled to have been  staged , due to the excessive anomalies seen in the dramatic 5 minute film entitled,  Signed With Blood: To The Nation Of The Cross. Editorial Director of the Florida-based Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium, Veryan Khan, told FOX News the following: The Islamic State s manipulation of their high-production videos has become commonplace. The background image shown was likely from another location, the Bay in Sirte, a part of the Mediterranean Sea on the northern coast of Libya. There are several technical mistakes in the video that show it was manipulated. According to Hollywood director Mary Lambert, who created the well-known horror film Pet Cemetery: The shot that seems really tampered with is the one with the really tall Jihadists and the dwarf Christians. The close-ups of Jihadists on the beach are most likely green screen. Prior to experts releasing their conclusion about the ISIS video production, here at 21WIRE, we outlined many of the film s irregularities and inconsistencies  proving that the film was indeed heavily orchestrated for maximum effect.   LARGER THAN LIFE     Notice the extreme height difference between the apparent ISIS members, as they dwarf the alleged Egyptian victims. (Photo link nationalpost.com)Staging A Crime: Public Relations, SITE & TerrorIn our first report regarding the Pentagon/Pottinger propaganda here at 21WIRE, some important ideas were raised. Perhaps most notably, how the public should perceive the ISIS related propaganda splashed all over Western media the past two years, and its use as a pretext for escalating US-led military involvement in Syria: Where this story gets really interesting is taken in context with all of the numerous staged ISIS and  Jihadi John  terrorist propaganda videos which flooded the US and British press and which were the basis for the entire US-led intervention against the so-called Islamic State in Syria. In addition, the character known as Jihadi John  has direct ties to British Security Services.  FAKE ISIS VIDEOS: This  Jihadi John  video was filmed in a studio, against a green screen. Was this produced by Bell Pottinger or a similar PR firm too? FOX News has since admitted that at least one of the ISIS beheading videos was staged in a studio. Part of Petraeus s deceptive operation also involved running an Arabic sector similar to US domestic propaganda efforts like Operation Mockingbird, where the Pentagon contractor would craft scripts for Arabic soap operas where characters would reject terrorism with happy consequences. This is especially interesting when considering that this Turkish TV program seems to predate the  Jihadi John  video genre, indicating that the same production team may have been employed in producing the fake green screen Jihadi John terror videos. Watch:In 2002, Rita Katz and Josh Devon founded Search for International Terrorist Entities Institute (SITE), which eventually developed into its current incarnation, as a propaganda outlet for high-profile terror groups such as al Qaeda and ISIS.The terror monitoring intelligence group is directly linked to both the CIA and Israeli intelligence. In 2006, the New Yorker article entitled,  Private Jihad: How Rita Katz got into the spying business,  discussed how SITE may have provided material support to would-be Jihadists via various message boards: Katz has a testy relationship with the government, sometimes acting as a consultant and sometimes as an antagonist. About a year ago, a SITE staffer, under an alias, managed to join an exclusive jihadist message board that, among other things, served as a debarkation point for many would-be suicide bombers. For months, the staffer pretended to be one of the jihadis, joining in chats and watching as other members posted the chilling messages known as  wills,  the final sign-offs before martyrdom. The staffer also passed along technical advice on how to keep the message board going.Continuing, the New Yorker outlined the serious nature of SITE s involvement with terror related entities from a legal perspective: Katz called officials in Washington, and was met with institutional resistance:  They said,  Oh, Rita, I m not sure you should even be communicating with them you might be providing material support! So, how exactly has SITE avoided any potential charges related to their organization, given that they ve admitted to providing advice to those potentially plotting attacks?Perhaps there s a better explanation Here s another look at a CNN interview with SITE founder and Israeli operative, Rita Katz, who admits,  we had that video beforehand and were able to beat them with the release . Notice how the intelligence group founder Katz, conveniently and calmly discusses acquiring the ISIS videos by claiming that the terror group needs a place to disseminate its exploits:In 2007, SITE came under fire for obtaining an alleged Bin Laden video a month prior to its release. In a sense, SITE was really functioning as a type of PR agent for the well-known terror avatar: Her [Rita Katz] firm provides intelligence about terrorist groups to a wide range of paying clients, including private firms and military and intelligence agencies from the United States and several other countries. Continuing: Katz said she decided to offer an advance copy of the bin Laden video to the White House without charge so officials there could prepare for its release. Many notable researchers and analysts have long believed that the now legendary  Bin Laden Raid  which took place in May 2011, was not only fabricated   but a propaganda ploy, with President Obama being the chief beneficiary by looking  tough on terror  during his re-election run against Mitt Romney. Even today, Hillary Clinton is also using the event as major part of her presidential campaign to covey her  national security  credentials. Based on our past research and reporting at 21WIRE, we ve also believed this to be case, making note of the obvious stagecraft some time ago: One thing which becomes clearer by the day about the fabled  Bin Laden Raid  which took place in Abbotabad, Pakistan, is that the US government has intentionally deceived the public about what happened. In other words, what President Obama described when he addressed the American people following  the raid    was a work of pure fiction. In addition, the bizarre and still relatively unexplained deaths of many SEAL Team 6 members taking place immediately after the alleged Bin Laden Raid has been be more cause for suspicion.The Bin Laden Raid was perhaps the largest ever theatrical man-hunt for a fugitive in the modern era  an event which failed to produce any credible forensic evidence. Many members of the medical field, have long suspected Bin Laden was dead. This supposition has also been supported by many high-ranking officials  including former Pakistani PM Benazir Bhutto, just prior to her assassination.  A Guardian report from October 2001 outlined Bin Laden s apparent serious health problems: Bin Laden has often been reported to be in poor health. Some accounts claim that he is suffering from Hepatitis C, and can expect to live for only two more years. According to Le Figaro, last year he ordered a mobile dialysis machine to be delivered to his base at Kandahar in Afghanistan. Additionally, a bevy of intelligence insiders, along with other mainstream media reports, have stated that the former CIA-linked asset Bin Laden, died somewhere between 2001 and 2002.On an interesting note, Memory Hole editor James F. Tracy discussed how Katz s SITE has suspiciously procured various terror plots ahead of all major US intelligence agencies: As noted, news outlets seldom see fit to closely analyze SITE or Katz concerning their research and function as conduits for terrorist propaganda. A LexisNexis search for SITE Intelligence in the article content of US newspapers and major world publications over the past two years produces 317 items an admittedly low figure given the prominence of SITE s recent disclosures. Yet a similar search for  Steven Sotloff  alone yields over 1,000 newspaper stories and 600 broadcast transcripts, suggesting the sensationalistic usage and effect of SITE s data and how neither SITE nor Katz are called upon to explain their specific methods and findings. Indeed, a similar search for  SITE Intelligence  and  Rita Katz  yields only 26 entries over a two year period. Of these, 14 appear in theWashington Post, a publication with well-established links to US intelligence. Four New York Times articles feature the combined entities. In a CNN interview on the heels of the Sotloff beheading, Katz explains how again SITE curiously surpassed the combined capacities of the entire US intelligence community in securing the Sotloff footage. PSYOP PLAYGROUND?    Bell Pottinger played a role in a psychological operations task force setup in Baghdad. (Image Source: psyopsinsignia)Shades of Propaganda The US Special Operations Center of Excellence, describes a historical context with which to view the type of  gray ops  disinformation campaign discussed above between the Pentagon and Pottinger: The documented history of PSYOP begins with the World War I activities of its antecedent, propaganda. In World War I, PSYOP  came into its own as a formal activity,  said retired Colonel Frank Goldstein. During that period, the three shades of propaganda   white, gray and black   appeared in a variety of unclassified and classified government programs aimed at motivating popular support for the war and demoralizing the enemy. It is important to understand that as propaganda moves from shades of white to black, the source of the propaganda becomes less obvious, until, in black propaganda, the source is unknown. The most memorable and successful World War I white-propaganda themes communicated that the war was necessary to  keep the world safe for democracy  and that it would be  the war to end all wars. For maximum impact, a PSYOP must be rooted in partial reality, followed by various phases of propaganda which parrot each other without contradiction. The scope of these specific types of operations are vast,  They include counterterrorism operations, peace operations, noncombatant evacuation, enforcement of sanctions and maritime interception operations, strikes and raids, etc. NGO WeaponizationThe far reach of NGO propaganda is becoming more transparent and is still being propped up by military arms such as NATO.Here s a passage from Patrick Henningsen s seminal article entitled  AN INTRODUCTION: Smart Power & The Human Rights Industrial Complex,  that intricately dissects the role of NGO s as they relate to the military industrial apparatus: Upon more rigorous inspection, however, a number of uncomfortable realities emerge regarding the 21st century international human rights concern. Though many human rights charities still market themselves as  neutral  and  nonpartisan , the reality is something very different. Below, we will detail a number of high-profile cases where these organisations are being used as public relations organs to further western foreign policy objectives. With public skepticism of the charity sector already at an all-time high, the danger is clear: if conflicts of interest are not addressed in a serious way, they threaten to undermine the credibility of the entire non-governmental organization (NGO) sector internationally.   MASS PROPAGANDA    The Save Aleppo campaign acts out images of war. (Image 21WIRE via (Photo: Land Destroyer)In a recent report from 21WIRE Special Contributor Vanessa Beeley, we see how many Western supported NGO narratives work symbiotically with the international body NATO: Amid the terrorist attacks and the daily massacres of Syrian civilians by [so-called] Western-backed  moderate rebels,  the children maimed and mutilated by these attacks are almost invisible to the mainstream media. The mainstream media does, however, showcase stories like that of Omran Daqneesh stories which serve and propel the NATO narrative despite the dubious sources from which they emanate. Akin to many mass casualty drills playing out simultaneously with America s Daily Shooter events, staged scenes with dust and fake blood are coming out of the  Save Aleppo  protests in Europe that seems to mimic elements of the Soros backed (al Qaeda linked) White Helmets in Syria. The impetus for such fakery, appears to be focused on getting the general public to push for deeper conflict in Syria.Interestingly, while NGO s are busy dialing into the heartstrings of the public with staged imagery, there are also recent designer social engineering studies backed by the Pentagon that are focused on mass civil unrest. All of this, as Soros pledges $500 million for the so-called migrant crisis in Europe.The scale of such US-sponsored social engineering projects are breathtaking. In June of 2014, in an article entitled,  Pentagon preparing for mass civil breakdown,  by Nafeez Ahmed, published at the UK s Guardian, we learned that:A new  research programme is funding universities to model the dynamics, risks and tipping points for large-scale civil unrest across the world, under the supervision of various US military agencies.  The program was brought to fruition during the height of the banking crisis in 2008, as Ahmed points out, suggesting it was already in the works for some time   and time was of the essence. The social science study may have been as big or bigger then the Snowden documents on NSA bulk collection, where not only are Americans being tracked but their behavior is being categorized, labeled and scrutinized, prompting those who value civl rights and privacy to question the ethics and morals of such a US government program. The Guardian article also outlined the type of militarized language used to describe civil movements promoting political change, ironically they used the NGO/US State Department engineered uprising in Egypt as a model for one social science study: Among the projects awarded for the period 2014-2017 is a Cornell University-led study managed by the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research which aims to develop an empirical model  of the dynamics of social movement mobilisation and contagions.  The project will determine  the critical mass (tipping point)  of social contagians by studying their  digital traces  in the cases of  the 2011 Egyptian revolution, the 2011 Russian Duma elections, the 2012 Nigerian fuel subsidy crisis and the 2013 Gazi park protests in Turkey. Essentially, this is computer modelling of  color revolutions  over sees  an expensive digital tool in the Pentagon and the CIA s  regime change  operations.Americans should be reminded that these programs are all taxpayer funded. The total bill is well into the billions by now.What s next in a world with designed outcomes, false narratives and staged crises?

23239,"US admits not targeting Al Nusra, then blames Moscow for separating ‘moderates’ from terrorists","21st Century Wire says While Russian and Syrian forces are doing the real work of actually fighting terrorists in Syria   the United States is arming, funding and training jihadists. In reality, the US failed to fulfill any of its ceasefire commitments in Syria. In fact, the US destroyed any hope of an agreement when it carried out a vicious airstrike killing upwards of 100 Syrian soldiers on Sept 17th.It s just a little bit rich for the ethically and morally challenged political detritus in Washington DC to be blaming Russia for not doing more to separate the  moderates  from the terrorists. Maybe that s because there is no  moderate opposition  in Syria. This is just a piece of fiction that Washington is trying to preserve in order to prop up its diplomatic facade regarding Syria. In the eyes of the Syrian state, if the opposition is armed, then they cannot rightly be called  moderates . This would be the same in the United States, or Great Britain.This hypocrisy, and Washington s adolescent insistence on playing semantic name games when referring to  moderate opposition  and  moderate rebels  are mere euphemisms for moderate terrorists.Despite all of this, CIA director John Brennan wants to keep talking tough, by threatening Russia: I think that pushing back against a bully is appropriate,  Brennan told Reuters.  I think that is very different than rushing in and bombing the hell out of a place.  CAUGHT ON TAPE: John Kerry s UN audio leak proved that the Secretary of State has been lying all along, to the Russians, the Syrians, the world, and to the US electorate that pays his salary. Kerry also admitted on tape that the US was arming and training terrorists in Syria.We know now that from the beginning of Washington s illegal entry into Syria airspace, their plan was to spare Al-Nusra and to keep it  just in case  for Plan B. Watch this recent clip where an Al-Nusra commander testifies on how the US supports jihadists in Syria in the form of arms, tanks and artillery: RTThe US is not targeting al-Nusra terrorists in Syria because they have become too  intermingled  with moderates and civilians, the US State Department claimed, accusing Moscow of causing the mess which prevents Washington from separating the groups.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov once again stressed in an interview with the BBC on Friday that Washington never delivered on its obligation to separate Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (known before the rebranding as al-Nusra Front) and other extremist groups from the so-called  moderate  rebels, to whom the US provides support.However, this time Lavrov went a step further and implied that Washington has been sparing terrorists in Syria on purpose, should they ever come in handy in terms of potentially overthrowing the government of Bashar Assad. They still, in spite of many repeated promises and commitments   are not able or not willing to do this and we have more and more reasons to believe that from the very beginning the plan was to spare al-Nusra and to keep it just in case for  Plan B    when it would be time to change the regime,  the Russian minister said.The US State Department has dismissed Lavrov s statements as absurd , instead accusing Russia of driving the  moderate opposition to intermingle with terrorist fighters on the battlefield against the Syrian government forces.Claiming that the US exerted every possible effort to influence and separate moderates from terrorists, State Departments spokesman Mark Toner told reporters at a daily briefing on Friday, that the  moderate opposition  have been  driven more or less into the arms  and have no other choice but to  turn to Nusra, fight side by side. Toner admitted that the US had not targeted al-Nusra for months because its members had become  intermingled  with other groups and civilians. We did carry out strikes initially, back in 2014-2015, against Nusra. But absolutely, you re correct in that, as they became intermingled and as they became intermingled in civilian areas, we ve always sought to limit the possibility of civilian casualties in any of our airstrikes,  Toner said Continue this story at RTREAD MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Syria Files",Middle-east,"October 4, 2016"

23241,"Diplomatic Frauds: Kerry, Power, Kirby Lying and Shilling for ‘Body Bags’ and War in Syria","Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireWhen US Secretary of State, John Kerry, on Thursday said there was no point  in pursuing further negotiations with Russia over Syria, you had to question on what basis this man is holding his current position as the nation s highest ranking diplomat. Really? No more diplomacy? At this point, even a conservative assessment would have to grade his performance as a failure.Regarding Russia, Kerry proclaimed,  We are on the verge of suspending the discussion,  adding,  It is one of those moments where we re going to have to pursue other alternatives for a period of time. At the time of this statement earlier this week, Kerry was not clear about what those  other alternatives would be, but yesterday, a new leaked audio presented by a New York Times journalist seems to answer this question  According to a leaked taped conversation acquired by The New York Times of a backroom meeting at the United Nations General Assembly, John Kerry was never been interested in a  diplomatic solution  to the conflict in Syria. Quite the opposite: his priority has always been to topple President Bashar Assad by military means and through the implementation of a  No Fly Zone  which would most certainly give a tactical advantage to US and Gulf-backed terrorist proxy fighting groups like Al Nusra Front, Arar al Sham and others. I ve argued for use of force. I stood up. I m the guy who stood up and announced we re going to attack Assad because of the weapons, and then you know things evolved into a different process. There it is: after all the diplomatic doublespeak, the underlying US policy is and always has been regime change.More shockingly, he then told a US-backed opposition operatives that,  you have nobody more frustrated than we are (the US)  that the Syrian conflict is now being solved  diplomatically    a clear betrayal of his job description, but also of the fundamental principles on which the UN was founded.Kerry also added further insult to injury by admitting that both Saudi Arabia and NATO member Turkey are financing Wahabist terrorist fighters on the ground: The problem is that, you know, you get, quote,  enforcers  in there and then everybody ups the ante, right? Russia puts in more, Iran puts in more; Hezbollah is there more, and and Saudi Arabia and Turkey put all their surrogate money in, and you all are destroyed. In the audio, Kerry keeps referring to the  opposition  but is careful and never brackets the confab of terrorist forces on the ground in that conversation, thus making the theoretical fantasy of a ceasefire somehow viable in his own parallel universe.The reality is that if Syria and Russia grounded their airforces in a ceasefire, then Al Nusra Front, Jaesh al Fatah, ISIS and other terrorists (many of whom are armed by the US) would simply step-up their own advances and attacks on civilian and SAA protected areas. The US knows this, and would like to see that happen for reasons now revealed by John Kerry in this recording.Something else in the tape was significant. After saying that Russia do not observe international law , Kerry then admitted that,  Russia was invited in (legally into Syria) while the US was not.Incredibly, Kerry also admitted that,  Hezbollah are not plotting against us (the United States) , and that,  Hezbollah are being targeted by the opposition who we (the US) are arming and training. Now, leaks are rarely if ever accidental in Washington, especially when a pro-Obama Administration newspaper like the New York Times is involved in the operation. Is Kerry trying to extricate himself from this 5 year-long foreign policy debacle? With Washington s crown jewel in the destabilzation project, Aleppo, due to fall any time now, perhaps he might be opening an intermediary exit door for this Administration from the current losing path to partitioning Syria. Time will tell.Listen to this incredibly informative leaked audio here: Interestingly, back in April, Raed Salah, the leader of the White Helmets, was denied entry into the US at Washington s Dulles International Airport and deported, supposedly told due to  extremist connections.  Salah was on his way to receive a humanitarian relief award at a gala dinner hosted by USAID. It turns that USAID has also pumped at least $23 million into the White Helmets. How did Salah get back into the US for this month s UN General Assembly festivities? Did Kerry intervene personally to help sidestep his travel ban? It seems that these days in Washington, the term conflict of interest  has lost all meaning with the ruling Mandarin class.Samantha Power s MeltdownMuch could be gleaned by Samantha Power s flippant tantrum after walking out of a crucial UN Security Council emergency session after the US had attacked and massacred over 80 Syrian military soldiers after a  Coalition  airstrike on Dier Azor   a US attack which allowed ISIS to strategically advance past Syrian Army defensive positions. Undoubtedly, this act by the US is what ruined any chance of a viable ceasefire agreement. Power then went on the blame Russia for the crisis.Here, the US was caught red-handed, and it seems that Power s only recourse was to lash out in an adolescent huff, indicating that she is not capable of maintaining a professional demeanor in public while tasked with managing the sensitive job of international diplomacy. As a result, many now believe that Power was promoted well above her own level of incompetence. Watch Power here: Kirby s Jejune Diplomacy  As if the shrill antics of Power were not enough, US State Dept spokesman John Kirby did his part this week in undermining America s reputation a trusted international broker of diplomacy. What s telling, however, about Kirby crass, passive aggressive evasive diatribes is the sound of desperation. His defensive reactions make it sounds as if the United States is losing in Syria. The truth is they are losing very badly. Still, like a good corporate soldier, he s trying to project confidence, believing he s  one of the good guys. While Kerry threatens to cut off all talks with Moscow over Syria unless they cease attacks on  Aleppo  (the US never want to say East Aleppo), Kirby added something even more toxic into the mix when he issued an unprecedented threat to Russia, saying: Russia will continue to send troops home in body bags..  Just like Kerry, Kirby s dangerous comment should disqualify Kirby from holding any diplomatic position in the US government. Maybe he should go back to the Pentagon where things aren t so complicated.Then Kirby began wielding his ISIS dog whistle, saying that Russia can expect terrorist attacks in Russian cities. Even more disappointing though, is Kirby s fallacious attempt to whitewash the war crimes of Saudi Arabia (and the US, too) in Yemen, as they wage an afront to international law and order with their undeclared war of aggression against their neighbor. In a verbal exchange with RT s correspondent Gayane Chichakyan over Syria, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, Kirby tries to avoid the uncomfortable question by attacking Chichakyan s network RT. Watch: Clearly, we are witnessing the internal implosion of the UN through systematic and institutional corruption, with the main players in this stage act being the United States and Saudi Arabia.Presently, the United States and its client in Saudi Arabia are in direct violation of the Nuremberg Principles that were established after WWII and which provide the legal and moral basis for both the Geneva Convention and the United Nations organization itself.So this is the dynamic trio that Barack Obama is hiding behind. American  diplomats  like John Kerry, Samantha Power, and John Kirby have a lot to answer for, because even though they may not be aware of it, everyone else now knows that their public outbursts are nothing more than smokescreens to cover the numerous lies and covert operations that the US government continues to sell regarding two dirty wars in Syria and Yemen.As it stands today, they are definitely on the wrong side of history.Here s more on John Kirby and US duplicity in Syria and Yemen RTUnless Russia  stops the violence  in Syria, extremists would  exploit the vacuum  to attack Russian interests and even cities, the US State Department has said. Extremist groups will continue to exploit the vacuums that are there in Syria to expand their operations, which could include attacks against Russian interests, perhaps even Russian cities. Russia will continue to send troops home in body bags, and will continue to lose resources, perhaps even aircraft,  John Kirby, the State Department s spokesperson, told reporters at Wednesday s press briefing.If the war continues  more Russian lives will be lost, more Russian aircraft will be shot down,  Kirby said.Early on Wednesday, US Secretary of State John Kerry threatened to end all cooperation between the United States and Russia to stop Syria s civil war, unless Moscow and Damascus ended the current attack on East Aleppo. We are working through steps that we might have to take to begin to suspend our engagement with Russia on Syria. We haven t taken those steps yet,  said Kirby.  The message to the [Russian] Foreign Minister today was that we are perfectly willing and able to move forward on those steps that would end with the suspension of US-Russia bi-lateral engagement in Syria. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov presented a different version of the call with Secretary Kerry, with the demand that the US live up to its obligation to separate opposition forces from extremist groups.The US promised long ago to separate the rebels from terrorists and it needs to live up to that obligation, Lavrov told Kerry, bringing up the recent interview of an Al-Nusra commander about how the group is receiving outside support   including American weapons   as well as the statement of a Syrian opposition leader Riyad Hijab that he did not consider Al-Nusra terrorists.Foreign Minister Lavrov told Kerry that many US-backed groups are working side by side with the Al-Qaeda affiliate, and brought up media reports that Nusra was receiving weapons from the US.During the press briefing, Kirby said the US had  influence over some of the [rebel] groups but not all. There are other nations that have influence. We have admitted that not all opposition groups on every single day have abided by it, and we have continued to work with them on that,  Kirby said, asked about the rebels  violations of the Syrian ceasefire.The Obama Administration has consistently called for regime change in Syria, and Kirby told reporters on Wednesday Obviously, we don t want to see the regime acquire any additional territory  in Aleppo.In response to the statement that Russia was targeting Nusra Front and terrorists, Kirby said  That s not what s happening. They re hitting hospitals, civilian infrastructure. When asked about the US arming Saudi Arabia, Kirby said the State Department had been critical about the  lack of precision in some strikes  in Yemen. We have a strong defense relationship with Saudi Arabia, and Saudi Arabia is under attack from missiles that are finding their ways to Yemen from Iran,  said Kirby, rejecting any comparison between what was happening in Yemen and what was happening in Syria, as  a ludicrous exercise.

23242,COVER-UP? New Details from Orlando Shooter’s Crisis Call Casts Light on FBI,"Shawn Helton  21st Century WireEarlier this week, the FBI released new details regarding an apparent crisis negotiation call made between Orlando Pulse nightclub shooter Omar Mateen and authorities.Will this new release reveal anything new about the Orlando shooting case, or will it continue a trend of unanswered questions regarding the incident? SCRIPT CHANGE OR TRUE MOTIVE?   The FBI has released more details regarding a crisis call said to have been placed by Omar Mateen (Photo illustration: 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)Crisis Call Motive According to the Washington Free Beacon [unredacted] transcripts were released by Orlando police Friday after a Florida court hearing held in response to a lawsuit filed by several news organizations.  The new details supposedly reveal a motive in the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting.Here s an excerpt from the alleged shooter Mateen s negotiation call featured in the Beacon: Yo, the air strike that killed Abu Wahid a few weeks ago  that s what triggered it, okay?  said Mateen, who earlier in the conversation identified himself as a follower the Islamic State terror group. They should have not bombed and killed Abu Wahid,  the former security guard declared.  Do your fucking homework and figure out who Abu Wahid is, okay? The shooting suspect allegedly discussed concern over US airstrikes in Syria, supposedly stating the following: They need to stop the U.S. air strikes. You have to tell the U.S. government to stop bombing. They are killing too many children, they are killing too many women, okay? Given Mateen s profile as stated by media and officials since June, the idea that he would be concerned with the lives of innocent civilians is patently absurd   making this latest, rather timely release, extremely suspect.Mateen s alleged crime confession via a crisis negotiation call, also smacks of another rewrite in the Pulse shooting saga, an event that displayed elements of foreknowledge and planning beyond that of a lonewolf. In addition, it was an incident littered with a number of anomalies and numerous intelligence connections. Although one cannot absolutely prove the scripted nature of this latest FBI release regarding the Pulse shooting, several quotes in the conversation stand out, falling in line with an all to familiar Western policy perspective regarding Syria and Iraq.Interestingly, after a number of strange motives were initially attached to the Orlando shooting, we re conveniently told it was  triggered  by an airstrike apparently killing Abu Wahib in May of this year. Wahib was an al-Qaeda/ISIS leader well-known to authorities and according to the controversial intelligence linked media blog Long War Journal. He had been detained by US officials in 2006 and sentenced to death in 2012, only to mysteriously escape from Tikrit Central Prison after a large jailbreak: Abu Wahib, whose full name is Shakir Wahib al Fahdawi al Dulaimi, has been waging jihad in Iraq for more than a decade. He was detained by US forces in Ramadi in 2006 during the height of al Qaeda in Iraq s insurgency.The LWJ article continued by stating the following: Wahib was sentenced to death and transferred to Tikrit Central Prison. In November 2012, he escaped along with 110 inmates after the Islamic State of Iraq assaulted the prison. That jailbreak and others like it infused the Islamic State of Iraq with leaders and fighters who were captured during US and Iraqi military operations. Given Wahib s lengthy criminal background and unexplained escape from prison, is it possible he may have been a Western intelligence asset released back into the public?The theory may not be as far-fetched as it seems when considering there is a historical precedence for such activity In the aftermath of 9/11 up until 2006, the CIA operated a facility that was used to train terrorists to be double agents to supposedly infiltrate Al Qaeda terror cells. This program was called called Penny Lane.Penny Lane was named after the Beatles tune and was connected to another secret facility called Strawberry Fields, a name also taken from the British rock group.We were told that operation had been successful in its scope   but by 2013, the CIA had  lost touch  with many of its newly trained double agents.The Penny Lane facility was unlike any other building in the Guantanamo Bay prison area, as it was said to have beds, kitchens and a patio for its prisoners. The money to pay informants and double agents was also provided for by the CIA under the codename  Pledge. But how does this relate to the Orlando club shooting?Drills & Informants Shortly after the Pulse shooting attack it was revealed that Mateen had been attending services at a Mosque, meeting with a known FBI informant named Marcus Dwayne Robertson (see left   also played role in 1993 WTC bombing), a former US Marine turned bank robber turned radical imam. Here s this passage from Fox News describing Robertson s role: It is no coincidence that this happened in Orlando,  said a law enforcement source familiar with Robertson s history of recruiting terrorists and inciting violence. Mateen was enrolled in [Robertson s online] Fundamental Islamic Knowledge Seminary.Robertson and several associates were rounded up for questioning early Sunday, according to law enforcement sources, a development his attorney refused to confirm or deny.   DISNEY MONEY BOMB?    Heavily orchestrated fundraising campaigns follow almost every dramatized mass shooting in America.  (Image Source: fox13news)Fast-tracked Fundraisers Interestingly, on September 27th, the Orlando Weekly revealed that  Each of the families of the 49 victims killed in the massacre at the gay nightclub Pulse will get $350,000 from the OneOrlando Fund this week, though privately, they still have to iron out who will get what funds. The Weekly also disclosed the total charitable amount received: The OneOrlando Fund received $29.5 million from various sources, which will now be divided between families and survivors of the mass shooting. The funds will be distributed through the end of this week, Martins says. Additionally, the article continues, stating that even uninjured patrons the night of the shooting will receive quite a large sum from the fund: The families of the deceased victims received a larger share of the funds, totaling about $17.2 million. The 37 survivors who were hospitalized after the shooting will receive anywhere from $65,000 to $300,000 depending on how many nights they spent at the hospital, while 31 people who required outpatient treatment for their injuries will get $35,000 each. An additional 182 patrons of Pulse who were there when the shooting began but not injured will received $25,000 each. The amount granted to Orlando victims is strangely, nearly the same amount given to all of the Charleston church families affected by the suspicious shooting involving Dylann Roof. It turned out, that the Department of Justice fast-tracked $29 million dollars from the Crime Victim Assistance Formula Grant program, shortly after the tragedy.According to OneOrlando s own website,  The OneOrlando Board, chaired by Orlando Magic President Alex Martins, was developed to provide oversight and guidance to ensure that funds are dispersed in a timely, accountable and transparent manner. Other members of the board include the following as stated on OneOrlando s website:Rena Langley, Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Worldwide Government and Industry Relations, Walt Disney World Diane O Dell, Vice President of Community Relations, Universal Orlando Resort Stephanie Ghertner, Director, Darden Foundation & Community Affairs Mark Meyer, Industry Manager, JPMorgan ChaseOn another note, a woman claiming to have been injured at Pulse the night of the shooting, was denied funds, leading her to sue OneOrlando. Here s the Orlando Sentinel on the matter: Jillian Amador, who filed the suit asking for an audit, was at Pulse with friends on June 12. She initially filed the complaint on Friday in Orange County Circuit Court, but a judge tossed it because the respondents were not served. She refiled the petition Tuesday, seeking an emergency order to stop the payout, but Circuit Judge John E. Jordan again denied the request.  VICTIM OR ACTOR?   The purported Pulse nightclub victim shown above was carried to the corner where he was seen walking off without assistance while still on camera. (Image Source: www.wftv.com)Revisiting The Orlando ShootingBack in June, here at 21WIRE, we discussed how the most important aspect of the FBI supplied 911 transcript had gone virtually unnoticed   as there was nothing in the contents of the transcript that discussed an actual shooting occurring inside of the Pulse nightclub.While the report was a basic outline of  America s largest mass shooting it failed to account for any of the shootings said to have occurred within the interior of Pulse. There was no mention of bar patrons being shot or reportedly shot at in the FBI s official narrative. It s as if the mainstream media and authorities left out the biggest piece of the investigation, as the implications of who shot who and when are extremely significant forensically speaking.While the description of the Orlando shooting included mention of the Orlando Police Department (OPD) pulling an air conditioning unit out of a Pulse  dressing room  to evacuate victims, a multi-call crisis negotiation, the alleged shooter s outrageous claims of a  bomb-laced vest  and authorities breaching the back wall of the nightclub with an explosive charge   there was no mention of additional shots fired at club goers inside Pulse? CRIME SCENE PROTOCOL?   Multiple officials seen coming in and out of Pulse nightclub with and without CSI attire. (Image Source: boingboing)In recent years, media press conference rituals backed by law enforcement officials have shaped a narrative within the first hours of a mass casualty event and even if that story turns out to be mostly false, the media runs with it anyway, whether or not new information and crime scene analysis belies the original story pushed by media. The most clear example of this happened during the aftermath of the WTC 1993 bombing, where major media outlets exposed it as an FBI run sting with their operators in control   yet still, media anchors still called it an al-Qaeda led attack.Aspects of the orchestrated bombing in 1993 played out in another high profile case dubbed the Newburgh Sting In May of 2009, the investigative tactics of the FBI came into question, none perhaps more suspect than the  Newburgh sting  an incident that involved the entrapment of four men in a fabricated terror event created by the bureau.Here s another look at a 2011 passage from The Guardian describing how an FBI informant named Shahed Hussain coerced four others to be involved in a fake terror plot: The  Newburgh Four  now languish in jail. Hussain does not. For Hussain was a fake. In fact, Hussain worked for the FBI as an informant trawling mosques in hope of picking up radicals.Yet far from being active militants, the four men he attracted were impoverished individuals struggling with Newburgh s grim epidemic of crack, drug crime and poverty. One had mental issues so severe his apartment contained bottles of his own urine. He also believed Florida was a foreign country.Hussain offered the men huge financial inducements to carry out the plot   including $250,000 to one man   and free holidays and expensive cars.As defence lawyers poured through the evidence, the Newburgh Four came to represent the most extreme form of a controversial FBI policy to use invented terrorist plots to lure targets.  There has been no case as egregious as this. It is unique in the incentive the government provided. A quarter million dollars?  said Professor Karen Greenberg, a terrorism expert at Fordham University. So when you consider what happened in Orlando, one should question the lack of shooting details, in addition to conflicting eyewitness testimony- why have portions of this story still been left open for interpretation when every other part of the official timeline of events appears to be accounted for?Here s a portion reviewing the  FBI s summary of events that excludes any mention of shots fired within Pulse: Based on OPD radio communications, there were no reports of shots being fired inside Pulse between the initial exchange of gunfire between responding officers and shooter, and the time of the final breach. During this time, the shooter communicated with an OPD 911 operator and an OPD crisis negotiator, and OPD radio communications reported that victims were being rescued. Here s a more basic chronology of the Orlando shooting, as told by the FBI: 2:02 a.m.: OPD call transmitted multiple shots fired at Pulse nightclub.2:04 a.m.: Additional OPD officers arrived on scene.2:08 a.m.: Officers from various law enforcement agencies made entrance to Pulse and engaged the shooter.2:18 a.m.: OPD SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) initiated a full call-out.2:35 a.m.: Shooter contacted a 911 operator from inside Pulse.3:03 a.m.: Second crisis negotiation call occurred lasting approximately 16 minutes.3:24 a.m.: Third crisis negotiation call occurred lasting approximately three minutes.4:21 a.m.: OPD pulled an air conditioning unit out of a Pulse dressing room window for victims to evacuate.4:29 a.m.: As victims were being rescued, they told OPD the shooter said he was going to put four vests with bombs on victims within 15 minutes.5:02 a.m.: OPD SWAT and OCSO Hazardous Device Team began to breach wall with explosive charge and armored vehicle to make entry.5:14 a.m.: OPD radio communication stated that shots were fired.5:15 a.m.: OPD radio communication stated that OPD engaged the suspect and the suspect was reported down. The Orlando shooting details state multiple shots [were] fired at Pulse nightclub at 2:02 am, as Additional OPD officers arrived on scene,  at 2:04 am, with law enforcement engaging the shooter at 2:08 am   again, there is no other mention of shots fired until police exchange fire with the alleged suspect after breaching the wall at 5:15 am.Matten s weapons of choice during the apparent attack were a Sig Sauer MCX .223 caliber rifle and a Glock 17 9mm semi-auto pistol    and according to the official story, and he was far more accurate than most well-trained law enforcement agents, defying statistical averages as examined by the Rand Corporation below.Question: Would it have really been possible for the alleged gunman Omar Mateen to have accurately shot over 100 people, take hostages and then engage in a fire fight with officers in just a 6 minute time frame?This scenario is hardly likely, if not impossible.Here s another look at an extensive study conducted by Rand Corporation that involved the NYPD: According to a 2008 Rand Corporation study evaluating the New York Police Department s firearm training, between 1998 and 2006, the average hit rate during gunfights was just 18 percent. When suspects did not return fire, police officers hit their targets 30 percent of the time.Many other such studies and risk assessments exist throughout law enforcement organizations nationwide, and most come to very similar conclusions as the RAND study. The odds are almost zero that the Pulse event was so drastically different   unless there was an intentional, or staged element at play here.Did the Police Kill Most of the Club Goers?Another aspect of the Orlando shooting attack was the possibility that many patrons could have been injured by authorities, something that also seemed to be absent from the official story. Here s a passage from WFAA8, an ABC affiliate discussing that point: Orlando Police Chief John Mina and other law enforcement officers offered new details about the shooting, including the possibility that some victims may have been killed by officers trying to save them. I will say this, that s all part of the investigation,  Mina said.  But I will say when our SWAT officers, about eight or nine officers, opened fire, the backdrop was a concrete wall, and they were being fired upon. Police also used an explosive charge and a Bearcat armored vehicle to breach the wall as civilians were allegedly holed up in a bathroom.

23244,Ron Paul: Syria Has Been in Chaos Ever Since Obama said ‘Assad Must Go’,"21st Century Wire says Ron Paul told RT that the US shouldn t engage in  death struggle  over who controls Aleppo.It s worth noting here that Ron Paul was correct back in Aug. 2013, when the US and Britain were insisting the Syrian government used chemical weapons against its own people in the Damascus suburb of East Ghouta. At the time Paul called it a  False Flag  designed to suck US into arming Jihadist rebels in Syria. Where Washington was demanding military strikes against Syria, cooler and more intelligence heads determined that the event was in fact staged, most likely by western and Gulf-backed  rebels. Regarding the collapse of the ceasefire around Aleppo, the former US Congressman and Presidential candidate said that Washington  should not be there [Syria]  at all, despite this being an  unpopular  opinion in political circles, because the intervention contributes to jihadists expanding even further. So, I think we are doing the wrong thing, Paul told RT.  I don t think it s good for our national defense. I think it makes us more vulnerable, because it does create more enemies. It s unpopular to suggest that maybe our presence over there contributes significantly to those who become radical jihadists and would like to do us harm. Watch Paul s interview here:  It s not a proper function   we don t have the moral authority. We haven t followed our own laws that said that we should not be involved in war and [the] overthrow of governments without a declaration of war,  he said.Source: RT NewsREAD MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Syria FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE and its work by Subscribing and becoming a Member @ 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"September 29, 2016"
23245,‘Feel Good Hoax’: How US Propaganda Works in the Syrian War,"21st Century Wire says One thing is certain about the War on Syria: the propaganda war being waged by the west and all of its agencies, from government to corporate media, to charities and third sector NGOs   is much larger and more pernicious than anything seen in modern history. The effort is extremely well-financed (to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars at least), and well-coordinated   too well in fact for many journalists to follow, many of whom have been seduced by multimillion dollar documentary productions of Netflix and endlessly cycled staged video clips and still images on networks like CNN and the BBC, and in newspapers like the New York Times, the Washington Post, The Times and The Guardian too. Why so much effort, and why the desperation by the west? What s at stake? The credibility of the Obama government, the Erdogan government, the Cameron/May governments, the Hollande government, NATO, the UN, western relations with Saudi Arabia, as well as a gas pipeline for Qatar into Europe, hundreds of billions in defense and  reconstruction  contracts, Soros s billions invested in various  projects , the Golan Heights, Eurasian dominance and checkmate of Russia, and the supremacy of  Smart Power  as a geopolitical weapon of choice for the Atlanticist bloc leaning forward into the 21st century   to mention only a few items.For the nation of Syria, the stakes are even higher  the survival of their country.So as we can see, there is a lot at stake for west and their business partners, and it should go without saying that they will do almost anything to take the many spoils of this latest war Rick Sterling Consortium NewsManipulation of public perception has risen to a new level with the emergence of powerful social media. Multibillion-dollar corporate giants, such as Facebook, Twitter and Google, influence public perceptions, often via payments for  boosting  Facebook posts, paid promotion of Tweets, and biased results from search engines.Marketing and advertising companies use social media to promote their clients, but so do U.S. foreign policy managers who hire or enlist these companies to influence public perceptions to support U.S. foreign policy goals.The results of similar media manipulation can be seen in the widespread misunderstanding of the conflict in Syria, amid the demonization of the Syrian government and leadership and the skillful use of social media by anti-government activists. Influenced by both mainstream and this alternative media, most people in the West do not know that Bashar al-Assad remains popular with many Syrians. Nor do they realize that Assad won an election two years ago. For example, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described making sure that Twitter was primed for street protests in Iran following the 2009 election, ready to spread and manage news of protests following the election and the killing of a young woman, which was blamed on the Iranian government although the circumstances of her death were murky. [Hard Choices hardback, p 423]There were three contestants in the Syrian presidential election of June 2014. Turnout was 73 percent of the registered voters, with 88 percent voting for Assad. In Beirut, the streets were clogged with tens of thousands of Syrian refugees marching through the city to vote at the Syrian Embassy. Hundreds of Syrian citizens living in the U.S. and other Western countries flew to Syria to vote because Syrian Embassies in Washington and other Western capitals were shut down.While Secretary of State John Kerry was condemning the Syrian election as a  farce  before it had even happened, a marketing company known as The Syria Campaign waged a campaign to block knowledge of the Syrian election. Along with demonizing President Assad, the company launched a campaign which led to Facebook censoring information about the Syrian election.  CHEMICAL ATTACK! : A heart-rending propaganda image designed to justify a  no-fly zone,  a major U.S. military operation inside Syria against the Syrian military.Incubating PropagandaThe Syria Campaign was created by a larger company named  Purpose,  which   according to its website    incubated . The Syria Campaign. The company s website says,  Purpose creates new movements, brands and organizations from the ground up to address complex global challenges. We apply this experience as movement creators to our work with progressive companies, nonprofits and philanthropies, helping them to put purpose and participation at the heart of what they do. The  White Helmets  are marketed in the West as civilian volunteers doing rescue work. On Sept. 22, it was announced that the Right Livelihood Award , the so-called  Alternative Nobel Prize,  is being given to the U.S./U.K.-created White Helmets  for their outstanding bravery, compassion and humanitarian engagement in rescuing civilians from the destruction of the Syrian civil war. The major achievement of The Syria Campaign has been the branding and promotion of the  White Helmets,  also known as  Syria Civil Defense,  which began with a British military contractor, James LeMesurier, giving some rescue training to Syrians in Turkey with funding provided by the U.S. and U.K. The group stole this name from the REAL Syria Civil Defense as documented in this recent report from Aleppo.SEE ALSO: WHO ARE SYRIA S WHITE HELMETSBut the White Helmets are largely a propaganda tool promoting Western intervention against Syria. Unlike a legitimate rescue organization such as the Red Cross or Red Crescent, the  White Helmets  only work in areas controlled by the armed opposition. As shown in this video, the White Helmets pick up the bodies of individuals executed by the terrorists; they claim to be unarmed but are not; and they falsely claim to be neutral.Many of the videos from Al Qaeda/terrorist-dominated areas of Syria have the  White Helmets  logo because the White Helmets work in alliance with these extremist groups as primarily a media marketing tool to raise public support for continuing the support to the armed opposition as well as the demonization of the Syrian government. The Rights Livelihood press release said the White Helmets  remain outspoken in calling for an end to hostilities in the country.  But that is false, too. The White Helmets actively call for U.S./NATO military intervention through a  No Fly Zone,  which would begin with attacks upon and destruction of government anti-aircraft positions and aircraft.A Major Act of WarTaking over the skies above another country is an act of war that would require a major U.S. military operation, according to senior American generals.General Martin E. DempseyThe New York Times reported that in 2012 General Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the White House that imposing a no-fly zone in Syria would require up to 70,000 American servicemen to destroy Syria s antiaircraft system and then impose round-the-clock control over Syrian airspace.General Carter Ham, former commander of the U.S. Africa Command who oversaw the aerial attacks on Libya in 2011, said on CBS News that  I worry sometimes that, when people say  impose a no-fly zone,  there is this almost antiseptic view that this is an easily accomplished military task. It s extraordinarily difficult.  It first entails   we should make no bones about it. It first entails killing a lot of people and destroying the Syrian air defenses and those people who are manning those systems. And then it entails destroying the Syrian air force, preferably on the ground, in the air if necessary. This is a violent combat action that results in lots of casualties and increased risk to our own personnel. In other words, an appeal for a  no-fly zone  is not a call for a non-violent solution. It is seeking a bloody act of war by the United States against Syria, a nation that poses no threat to America. It also would almost surely be carried out in violation of international law since a United Nations Security Council resolution would face vetoes from Russia and probably China.Also, the White Helmets have never criticized or called for the end of funding to extremist organizations including Nusra Front, Al Qaeda s Syrian affiliate. On the contrary, White Helmets are generally embedded with this organization which is defined as  terrorist  by even the U.S., which is likely why the head of the White Helmets, Raed Saleh, was denied entry to the U.S.The foreign and marketing company origins of the White Helmets were exposed over 1  years ago   and since then, writer Vanessa Beeley has revealed the organization in more depth in articles such as  Who Are the White Helmets?  and  War by Way of Deception. Despite these expos s, understanding of the White Helmets is limited, with many liberal and progressive people uncritically accepting the propaganda and misinformation about Syria. Much of the progressive media has effectively blocked or censored critical examinations amid a flood of propaganda about  barrel bombs  dropped by the  brutal dictator  and his  regime. In the last week, Netflix started showing a 40-minute documentary movie about the  White Helmets  that amounts to a promotional video. A substantial portion of it takes place in Turkey where we see trainees in hotel rooms making impassioned phone calls to inquire about their families in Syria. The  family values  theme is evident throughout, a good marketing angle. The political message of the video is also clear: after a bombing attack,  It s the Russians  . they say they are fighting ISIS but they are targeting civilians. The movie includes video previously promoted by the White Helmets such as the  Miracle Baby  rescue, an incident that may or may not have been staged. The video includes self-promoting proclamations such as  You are real heroes.  While no doubt there are some real rescues in the midst of war, many of the videos purporting to show the heroes at work have an unrealistic and contrived look to them as revealed here.Tricking Progressives Alternative media  in the West has echoed mainstream media regarding the Syria conflict. The result is that many progressive individuals and groups are confused or worse. For example, the activist group CodePink recently issued a media release promoting the Netflix White Helmets propaganda video.The White Helmets video is produced by Grain Media and Violet Films/Ultra-Violet Consulting, which advertises itself as a marketing corporation specializing in social media management, grant writing, crowd building and campaign implementation. The only question is who paid them to produce this video There is growing resistance to this manipulation and deception. In response to a petition to give the Nobel Peace Prize to the White Helmets, there is a counter petition at Change.org. Following the Right Livelihood Awards  announcement, there will soon be a petition demanding retraction of the award to the White Helmets.The story of the White Helmets is principally a  feel good  hoax to manipulate public perception about the conflict in Syria and continue the drive for  regime change.  That s why big money was paid to  Purpose  to  incubate  The Syria Campaign to brand and promote the White Helmets using Facebook, Twitter, etc. That s why more big money was paid to create a self-promotional documentary. The judges at Rights Livelihood were probably influenced by the documentary since critical examination of facts around Syria is so rare. It s a sad commentary on the media. As veteran war correspondent Stephen Kinzer recently wrote,  Coverage of the Syrian war will be remembered as one of the most shameful episodes in the history of the American press.

23247,What’s Really Behind the Senate’s Override of Obama Veto of Saudi 9/11 Lawsuit Bill?," 21st Century Wire says While the US media follows the red herring of this legislative drama which is Saudi Arabia, the real point of this bill   and why President Obama is so vehemently opposing it   is going completely unnoticed. If any case was brought to court by 9/11 families to sue Saudi Arabia for  state-sponsored terror  regarding the attacks in New York City on September 11, 2001, the court would find there is no real forensic case proving Saudi involvement in this event. Other problems will crop up too. For starters, at least 7 of alleged hijackers were actually found to be alive after their faces were plastered on US TV screens after 9/11. As it stands, the US government s official story of 9/11 is so flimsy and full of holes, including the complete omission or mention of the collapse of WTC Building 7 (which was hit by nothing, and yet collapsed into its own footprint in 7 seconds) and the lack of any plane wreckage at the Pentagon (we re meant to believe that the passenger airliner evaporated into thin air on impact, and no real CCTV footage has been provided to back the government s own wild explanation). In actuality, the US government would love a dead-end lawsuit against Saudi Arabia which could only result in some out-of-court settlement anyway   because this would supply a nice diversion away from any further scrutiny of the US government s bogus explanation of what really happened that day.More to the point, however, is the real potential story here. If passed, this bill would allow a number people, particularly those in Syria, to sue the US, British, French, Dutch, Norwegian, Polish, Turkish and Saudi Arabia and Qatar too, all of who are actively involved in supplying money, equipment, arms and military training to a number of known Salafist Terrorists fighting groups in Syria.KEY POINT: Why is Obama protecting Saudi Arabia? One of Obama s top financial partners in the dirty war on Syria is Saudi Arabia, who has also paid for  off-the-books  CIA operations there. Unlike Saudi and 9/11, by definition, this is state-sponsored terrorism.The House is expected to hold a vote later this week. It could be the first override of a Presidential veto during the Obama administration . Karoun Demirjian Washington PostThe Senate on Wednesday voted to override President Obama s veto of legislation that would allow 9/11 victims  families to sue the Saudi Arabian government over its alleged support for the terrorists who carried out the attacks. The vote was 97 to 1.The House is expected to vote later in the day and if successful, it will be the first time Congress has overridden a veto during the Obama administration. Overriding a presidential veto is something we don t take lightly, but it was important in this case that the families of the victims of 9/11 be allowed to pursue justice, even if that pursuit causes some diplomatic discomforts,  Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who co-authored the bill with Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), said in a statement.Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) cast the lone vote to sustain the veto after receiving a letter from Obama arguing the consequences could be  devastating,  and urging him  to vote to sustain the veto.  Reid voted against the override despite telling reporters earlier this month that  I support that legislation  and Schumer s efforts. He s always had the president s back,  said Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson.Both chambers passed the legislation without dissent earlier this year, but now several lawmakers are echoing the White House s argument that the legislation could set a dangerous precedent, inviting other nations to respond by suing American diplomats, military personnel and other officials in foreign courts.Critics of the bill are now focusing on how to scale back the measure once it becomes law. Approximately 20 senators have signed onto a letter expressing their intention to return to the issue during the lame duck if there are negative consequences once the 9/11 bill becomes law Continue this article at the Washington PostREAD MORE 911 NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 9/11 FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE and its work by Subscribing and becoming a Member @ 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"September 28, 2016"
23248,Hillary Clinton’s ‘Presidency’ has Already Begun as Lame Ducks Promote Her War on Syria,"21st Century Wire says One glaring conclusion from last night s US Presidential debate is that there is virtually no difference between either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton s view on what the US should do in Syria. Both are advocating for more war   for more airstrikes in Syria, and for  building safe zones  which are actually  No Fly Zones  (where only US Coalition aircraft are allow to fly).There is one vast difference however, between these two candidates. During her tenure as Obama s Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was both the architect of the US-led destruction of the Libyan State, and also of Washington s secret war against Syria, officially from 2011. Clinton led the notorious  Friends of Syria  lobbying tour through Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, which was used to promote the US policy of  regime change  for Syria by bringing together Gulf Arab Monarchies (Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, UEA and others) and other US client states to create a policy of economic, military and social subterfuge which, with the help of the CIA and others, has since destroyed large parts of Syria now occupied by Terrorist fanatical groups   who are backed by the same  Friends of Syria  member nations managed by Clinton. From start, these two wars were managed by what is allegedly a liberal  or left-wing Democrat Party. They are anything but.What this really means, is that the next  President Clinton  is already priming Americans for a escalation of warfare in Syria come this January. Here s why  In 2011-2012, Secretary of State Clinton was busy drumming up support for an attack on Syria, and supporting armed  rebel  terrorists in Syria (Image: IB Times)Diana Johnstone Consortium NewsIf the British Empire was built on the playing fields of Eton, United States world hegemony gets its training in Hollywood studios and advertising agencies. Selling your product, or yourself, by looking sincere is a cultivated American art. Current top U.S. leaders are expert practitioners.In the space of a few days, Samantha Power, John Kerry, and Barack Obama all turned in war-winning performances.Three Deadly U.S. Blows to Hopes of Peace In SyriaLast August 8, on that serious think tank the Charlie Rose show, former acting CIA director Michael Morell said that U.S. policy in Syria should be to make Iran and Russia  pay a price . Russians and Iranians should be killed  covertly, so you don t tell the world about it , he said. Morell proposed that U.S. forces begin bombing Syrian government installations, in order to  scare Assad . Probably angling for a good job next year, he is on record supporting Hillary Clinton as a  highly qualified commander in chief  and a  strong proponent of a more aggressive approach  in Syria.Act I   An Act of WarThen, on Saturday, September 17, the U.S. Air Force did exactly what that CIA insider had called for. In sustained air strikes, four U.S. jets bombed a key Syrian Army position that had been defending the town of Deir ez-Zor from ISIS/Daech fighters. More than sixty Syrian soldiers were killed and over a hundred wounded. Daech forces immediately took advantage of the strikes to overrun the government position. In effect, the U.S. Air Force acted as air cover for the Islamic fanatics U.S. to advance against the legitimate army of Syria.This was not only a violation of the cease-fire painstakingly worked out by Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. It was an open military aggression by the United States on the territory of a sovereign state.The Russians immediately called an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council to respond to this deadly violation of the truce supposedly intended to facilitate peace negotiations and humanitarian aid. When Russian ambassador Vitaly Churkin took the floor to speak, his American counterpart, Samantha Power, draped in her long red mane, walked out to give a press conference that clearly illustrated the difference between Russian and U.S. diplomacy.Churkin, like Lavrov a few days later, cited facts and analysed the situation rationally. Samantha Power put on a show of evasion and insults.Why all the fuss? was her opening theme. After all, we halted the attack when we were informed that  it was possible we might be hitting Syrian regime personnel and vehicles , she stated, adding that  if  we did so,  that was not our intention . That should settle the question; who could believe that the United States might deliberately attack the regime their politicians have been saying  must go ? The best defense is offensive, and Power can be most offensive: Even by Russia s standards, tonight s stunt   replete with moralism and grandstanding is uniquely cynical and hypocritical , she declared.Samantha Power, that conniving arriviste whose carefully constructed career has been built on moralism, grandstanding, cynicism and hypocrisy, had all the nerve in the world to turn these epithets against the prime target of her own habitual moralism, grandstanding, cynicism and hypocrisy.If the air strikes hadn t been enough to destroy Russian confidence in dealing with the United States, Samantha Power s contemptuous reaction was sure to do the trick.Act II   Change the SubjectNext ploy: change the subject. Our little accidental bombing is nothing, Power implied, compared to the alleged fact that  since 2011 the Assad regime has intentionally been striking civilian targets with horrifying, predictable regularity . Here is the core of the Samantha Power fraud, containing two elements:1/ While good-hearted bumbling America occasionally kills a few people by accident, the others do it all the time and above allintentionally.2/ Killing civilians is what war is all about. War is not about battles between armed forces for control of territory. It is not about geopolitical power struggles. It is about  civilian victims .At the close of her stunt, grandstanding and scoring cheap points, Samantha Power exhorted Russia  to stop the cheap point scoring and the grandstanding and the stunts and focus on what matters, which is implementation of something we negotiated in good faith with them.  Good faith? They are supposed to believe we negotiated  in good faith  an agreement which we just flagrantly destroyed?Lo and behold, only two days after the U.S. bombing of Deie ez-Zor, the subject was definitively changed when an international humanitarian aid convoy was attacked on its way to Aleppo. Twenty aid workers were killed and the aid mission was halted. Without waiting for any evidence, the unanimous cry went up from Washington that  the Russians did it! In the U.N. Security Council this time, John Kerry took the stage. Again, the critical point was the contrast between what we certainly did and what they allegedly did. Yes, we committed  a terrible accident . But what they (allegedly) did was worse. I got to tell you, people running around with guns on the ground, from the air, is a very different thing from trucks in a convoy with big UN markings all over them,  Kerry declared. He was implying that the difference was between an understandable accident, whose victims were  running around with guns , and an attack on civilians. Yes, but in war, attacking soldiers is the whole point. It can make a difference in the outcome. Hitting an aid convoy is  collateral damage , as the U.S. calls it when the bombs are American.  By bombing Deir ez-Zor, the United States was taking part in a war in which Syria is fighting for its life.It cannot be ruled out that Syrian forces attacked the aid convoy because the truce was already broken at Deir ez-Zor and they believed it concealed weapons being transported to Daech. Such things happen. Or the attack could have been carried out by rebels as an act of propaganda, a  false flag , designed precisely to be used to accuse the adversary. Such things also happen.It has already been established by careful research that the notorious Al Ghouta chemical weapons attack, attributed to Assad, was almost certainly carried out by rebels precisely in order to incite the United States to cross the  red line  set by President Obama and bomb Damascus. The War Party which by now controls the Pentagon, much of the State Department, most of Congress, as well as leading media and think tanks, has been castigating Obama ever since for not having seized that opportunity to wage a full-scale  regime change  war against Syria. The critics have never forgiven Obama for accepting the Russian proposal to use the occasion to rid Syria of its chemical arsenal, instead of overthrowing the Syrian government.But in recent weeks, as the Hillary Clinton campaign grows more frantic, Obama himself has joined the War Party. IMAGE:  Dusty Boy  Omran.Act III   Wallow in SentimentalityOn September 20, President Obama used a Leaders Summit on Refugees to portray the Syrian episode in what increasing appears to be World War III as a sentimental children s story. Obama read the letter from 6-year-old Alex, who lives in Scarsdale, New York, expressing his wish to adopt Omran Daqneesh, the bewildered 5-year-old boy with a mop of dusty hair whose photo sitting in an orange ambulance seat was iconized across the world. The letter, provided to mass media by the White House, with its childish writing but nearly perfect spelling, was full of touching details about butterfly collections and shared toys. Obama read the letter, as people reached for Kleenexes all over the country, and then commented: Those are the words of a six-year-old boy   a young child you has not learned to be cynical, or suspicious, or fearful of other people because of where they come from, how they look, or how they pray. We should all be more like Alex. Imagine what the world would look like if we were. The little boys are very cute, very sweet. Fortunately, Omran Daneesh s parents are alive, so there is no need to adopt him. Many other children are dead, notably in Yemen, killed by Washington s ally Saudi Arabia with arms provided by the United States. Too late to adopt them. We should all be more like Alex , Obama tells his good people. Imagine indeed, if all Americans were as innocent and na ve as six-year-old children. And indeed, that seems to be the goal of government propaganda.This propagandistic heartstring tugging is aimed at distracting from U.S. involvement in a long-term joint criminal enterprise to overthrow a government that indeed did not discriminate against people because of  how they pray , and replace it by fanatics who are ready to behead people because of  how they pray .An infantilized public will believe that  geopolitics  and  national sovereignty  are just big words that don t mean anything. An infantilized public will believe that when the United States goes to war, it is all about protecting little children from their bad, mean dictators, whose only aspiration is to  bomb their own people . They will believe that the world out there is Little Red Riding Hood, threatened by the Big Bad Wolf, and that there really is a Santa Claus.It will never occur to an infantilized public that the war to destroy Syria has been planned for years   even though someone like General Wesley Clark revealed this years ago. Or that it is carried out to eliminate Israel s enemies, keep Arabs busy killing each other, and incidentally help Saudi Arabia spread its Wahhabite fanaticism. No, that will never occur to them.They won t even notice that the Obama administration has now effectively given up any effort to justify the Nobel Peace Prize so foolishly bestowed on the apprentice president, and is now engaged in a scenario designed to prepare for Hillary s next successful regime change war in Syria.And it won t occur to them that the photo of the little boy in the orange seat was quite deliberately iconized by Western media as part of the campaign promoting the Islamic rebel-connected  White Helmets  for the future Nobel Peace Prize.Another subtle step in demonizing the  Assad regime  before Hillary takes over to administer the planned coup de grace. The future chuckler-in-chief is looking forward to seeing another head fall.

23251,STRANGE: Hillary Goes Off the Rails in Labor Union Speech,"21st Century Wire says If you haven t seen Hillary Clinton s bizarre and shrill performance the other night, it should be required viewing for anyone following the current 2016 Presidential Election.Clearly, something was very wrong with the Democratic Party candidate during this segment, as she shouted flippantly, made some very strange statements   almost as if she was parodying herself in a Saturday Night Live skit By Anthony Brian LoganOn Wednesday, September 21st, 2016, Hillary Clinton gave a speech / address to the Laborers  International Union of North America in which she went completely off the rails. Her pitch was to support labor unions and be anti-right-to-work, something that Donald Trump has praised and supported. During the midst of her speech, something went left. Not with the environment of the place she was delivering the speech. Not with the camera equipment. But with Hillary herself. The BIOS mainframe seemed to have obtained a virus.When she begins to talk about why she isn t 50 points ahead of Trump, Hillary begins to shout and point with a scowl on her face. Maybe the numbers have her upset to the point where she can t contain it anymore? It s hard to tell. But whatever the case is, her behavior does not appear to be presidential.And that brings up the question she raised during her tirade.  Why aren t I 50 points ahead of Trump?  Well, the answer to the question is simple. The reason for that is because of her behavior, as exhibited in the aforementioned video to the labor union. Also, countless other videos. Such as the video of her collapsing to the point where one of her shoes flew off and landed under a vehicle during the 9/11 ceremony in New York City. The video of her having what appears to be Parkinson s related episode in a coffee shop where her head moves back and forth in an awkward, somewhat violent way. The constant coughing fits. The Parkinson s fit after the coronation speech at the 2016 DNC. Last but not least, the constant corruption. Emails, Benghazi, Clinton Cash, the list goes on and on.So maybe the answer to the question she raised and the question many people have about Hillary s behavior is much more easy to explain. A fear of losing and a general problem with Hillary herself, whether that be medical or just her personality in general. All Hillary, and Hillary supporters can do at this point is hope these problems don t reveal themselves during the debate on Monday September 26th or her chances at becoming the President will be over. Which, in reality, is good for America anyway  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtLznfIDEzI . READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"September 26, 2016"
23252,ACTIVE SHOOTER OR DRILL? The Cascade Mall Shooting,"21st Century Wire says There have been a string of active shooter events prior to 2016 s first presidential debate this coming week   with many incidents appearing suspicious in nature. The Guardian reports that the apparent motive still remains unclear: A 20-year-old suspect was in custody on Sunday for the killing of five people during a deadly shooting at a mall in Burlington, Washington, two days before. Arcan Cetin of Oak Harbor, Washington, a legal permanent resident who had immigrated to the US from Turkey, was discovered  zombie-like , police said, on Saturday evening after police responded to a tip-off following an intensive 24-hour manhunt. Cetin was unarmed at the time of his arrest, authorities said. Although a motive for the shooting remains unclear, authorities told local media that Cetin s ex-girlfriend had previously worked at the targeted department store but left her job months ago. The suspect had been charged three times with domestic assault against his stepfather and had been ordered by a judge not to possess a firearm, according to the Seattle Times. At a Saturday press conference, the FBI said terrorism was not a suspected motive.

Instead, news media were told victims remained in the mall awaiting the local coroner. The Washington Post reports, As of Saturday morning, the bodies of the four female victims were still inside the mall, Skagit County coroner Hayley Thompson said at a news conference Saturday. Thompson said when she gained access to the scene, the four female victims would be taken to Skagit Valley Hospital and undergo autopsies. Such events are reported on by major news media uncritically, thus supporting the call for strengthened gun control measures while ironically stimulating gun purchases by a public that fears such restrictions.The Cascade Mall shooting s police spokesperson for the event is Washington State Patrol s Mark Francis.

23253,SHOUT! POLL: Do the ‘White Helmets’ Qualify for a Nobel Peace Prize?," 21st Century Wire asks Currently throughout the western media exists a major public relations push to raise the profile of supposed  NGO  in Syria known as the  White Helmets  in advance of the upcoming Nobel Peace Prize award on Oct 7th in Oslo, Norway. Recently, streaming giant Netflix released a documentary film to much fanfare, about this alleged  first responder  group in Syria called the White Helmets. They produce many of the emotional images seen on western media about the Syrian conflict, and also claim to have saved 60,000 lives from  Assad s bombs  since 2013. What many people are not aware of, however, is that this group has been financed by NATO member states to the tune of at $60 million so far, and they are embedded exclusively in terrorist-held areas of Syria.

23255,"ANOTHER KNOWN WOLF? NYC Bombing Suspect Probed by FBI, Leading to Bigger Questions"," Shawn Helton 21st Century WireThe New York bombing attack has a list of details that don t add up.When examining what transpired this past week in New York and New Jersey, we must consider a deeper social engineering agenda that may be at play   as part of a larger geopolitical drama continues unfold in Syria.While August ushered in a hyper-propagandized war image that went viral in the West, September delivered an alleged active-shooter  false alarm  played out at both JFK airport and LAX as well as the apparent bombings in New York City and New Jersey this past week.As bombs go off outside, Obama sails through the UNGA.You have to wonder, were the events in New York and New Jersey also a weapon of mass distraction, following a major international embarrassment for the United States both at home and abroad   the brutal airstrike campaign in Syria that killed over 70 Syrian troops? This unlikely bombing incident just happened to also coincide with the UN General Assembly in NYC, where President Obama was delivering among other speeches, his War on Terror  addresses to the international community. No surprise then, with the city suddenly on  high terror alert    that Obama quickly and confidently and comfortably used his center stage spotlight at the UN, shifting into  national security  mode   boasting how quickly his police forces solved the case. It was almost if he was ready for events that weekend.The alleged NYC bombing suspect was named as 28 year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami, who managed the family Chicken Kebab Shop. He has been charged with using  weapons of mass destruction  in addition to other criminal charges. Similar to what was described in the apparent Boston Marathon Bombing of 2013, Rahami is alleged to have created a homemade pressure cooker bomb which exploded in Chelsea, an affluent neighborhood of Manhattan. Oddly missing are scenes depicting the transport of 31 injured individuals after the explosion in New York.  BOMBER OR PATSY?    Ahmad Khan Rahami was known to both US officials and Pakistani officials (Image Source: BBC)NYC s  Known Wolf After the mainstream media and officials floated the idea that a  Wireless Emergency Alert  system helped to locate and find Rahami with an  electronic wanted poster,  it turns out the FBI already knew him.According to The Washington Post, the FBI had already known Rahami since 2014, making this latest  known wolf  attack a strongly suspicious event: The FBI s probe into Ahmad Khan Rahami, the 28-year-old named as the only suspect in the bombings, was launched based on comments his father had made. An official said his father later recanted his comments. Agents conducted interviews, checked with other agencies and looked at internal databases,  none of which revealed ties to terrorism,  the bureau said in a statement.But why then, was Rahami on the radar of Pakistani intelligence in recent years?During the San Bernardino caper last December, we were told that supposedly Pakistani-born Tashfeen Malik, had ties to The Red Mosque in Pakistan, a well-known Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) linked mosque: Sources have told Daily Mail Online that US officials handed over information to their Pakistani counterparts about links between Tashfeen Malik and the Red Mosque in Islamabad. The mosque is infamous for its links to violence and authorities in Pakistan are now considering taking action against its preacher, Maulana Abdul Aziz, after the disclosures by US officials. If Malik was inspired by ISIS, as claimed by authorities (via social media) then why did her background suggest a Pakistani/ISI/CIA/Al-Qaeda connection, if she was in fact radicalized  as US plot writers insist?The UK s Telegraph stated that the part of Pakistan where Malik was staying is  known as a recruiting ground for Al-Qaeda-linked Islamist groups, including Lashkar al-Taiba, responsible for a bloody attack in Mumbai, India s financial capital, in 2008. If true, this was a new twist in the media hyped San Bernardino shooting, displaying a startling link between the Al Qaeda/ISI affiliated Red Mosque and other Western-backed black ops in Pakistan.In May of 2011, The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) outlined the ISI s material support for various militant groups, including the formation of Al-Qaeda   giving historical context to recent events: The ISI s first major involvement in Afghanistan came after the Soviet invasion in 1979, when itpartnered with the CIA to provide weapons, money, intelligence, and training to the mujahadeen fighting the Red Army. The CFR further stated,  Pakistan s government has repeatedly denied allegations of supporting terrorism, citing as evidence its cooperation in the U.S.-led battle against extremists. The CIA and ISI, have had a long, sometimes contentious relationship on the surface but the reality is that their collective footprint, is all over many tribal areas in Pakistan and places like Afghanistan   where extremism continues to grow to this day.Malik s affiliations suggested that she could have been involved with one of the intelligence agencies active in the exact location she resided in Pakistan   was this also the case with Rahami, given his link to a Pakistani seminary with ties to the Taliban?The UK s Guardian reported the following: The 28-year-old, who was born in Afghanistan but became a US citizen, spent time at the Kaan Kuwa Naqshbandi madrasa on his two visits to Pakistan, a security official working for the government of Balochistan province told the Guardian. Cointinuing, the article discussed how Pakistani officials have limited the information they have about Rahami: US officials have revealed basic details about Rahami s two visits to Pakistan, the first in 2011 when he spent a couple of months in Quetta and got married and almost a year in 2013 when he also made a car journey to Afghanistan.But very little information has emerged from inside Pakistan about what Rahami did during his visits.The government official, who did not wish to be named because he was speaking about a highly sensitive subject, said Pakistani security agencies have tried to  hide all the details of his visits to Quetta  and keep as much information as possible out of the media. It s also worth noting the similarities of this case to that of another  known wolf  who traveled overseas before a major domestic event, the alleged Boston Bomber, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who had previously been recruited by the FBI, most likely as an informant. This might help to explain why Tamerlan traveled overseas to attend the  American Committee for Peace in the Caucasus  in Dagestan, during the summer of 2012   an event organised by the Jamestown Foundation   itself another known CIA front, and part of a vast network  controlled by Freedom House (George Soros) and linked to the CIA , as reported by the Voltaire Network.  INFORMANT OR TERRORIST?    What was Rahami s real role in the New York and New Jersey bombings and bomb attempts? (Image Source: nbcnews) Sturm und Drang During a hotly contested US presidential election cycle, multiple overlapping narratives continue to contribute to an environment of confusion, fear and uncertainty in the War On Terror era.Mass media has worked out their own formula for laying out a familiar series of polarizing political points in the aftermath of any  tragic  event, as they have with many others. Appearing once again, to purposefully redirect the public to look at a ready-made laundry list of hateful rhetoric and random writings as an ironclad motive for a crime. The aftermath in the case of New York is no different, as it rapidly descended into an overindulgent barrage of media speculation and theorizing.All too often we ve seen the  stage persona of any alleged attacker or killer being touted as hard evidence, despite the fact that even strong circumstantial evidence of any apparent crime would likely result in many hours of analysis and debate, potentially without a definitive conclusion, even if the evidence eventually reached a court room setting.As 21WIRE has covered in recent years, very often there is much more involved behind-the-scenes when it comes to sensationalized attacks in America, particularly of those said to be  lone wolf events. The incidents themselves are quickly taken out of the political and forensic realm, giving way to a hyper-realized account, often defying logic and reason.Drills, Patsies & DupesIn May of 2015, the NY Post stated the following, after the city s largest ever terror drill involved mock explosions: Officials said the event was the largest  active-shooter  operation ever, involving more than 200 NYPD and FDNY officers.It was the ninth full-scale exercise of its kind since the beginning of 2014. Chief of NYPD Counterterrorism Bureau James Waters explained that the drill replicated portions of events that occurred in San Bernadino, in the Bataclan in Paris and in Australia. Continuing, the article described the intricate mass exercise: On the third and the fourth floors we had additional explosions go off, replicating things that happened at the Bataclan nightclub, and that pushed the ESU officers up to the third floor, and finally the fourth floor, where they encountered a barricade with a hostage situation,  he said, explaining that the cops again were able to stop the shooters. For the average person, its hard to differentiate from a drill or a real event, causing one to scrutinize the legitimacy of such an operation.In recent years, the investigative tactics of various intelligence agencies have come into question, none perhaps more dubious then the Newburgh FBI sting that involved entrapping four men to participate in a fabricated event created by the bureau. Here s a 2011 passage from The Guardian describing how an FBI informant named Shahed Hussain coerced four others into a fake terror plot: The  Newburgh Four  now languish in jail. Hussain does not. For Hussain was a fake. In fact, Hussain worked for the FBI as an informant trawling mosques in hope of picking up radicals.Yet far from being active militants, the four men he attracted were impoverished individuals struggling with Newburgh s grim epidemic of crack, drug crime and poverty. One had mental issues so severe his apartment contained bottles of his own urine. He also believed Florida was a foreign country.Hussain offered the men huge financial inducements to carry out the plot   including $250,000 to one man   and free holidays and expensive cars.As defence lawyers poured through the evidence, the Newburgh Four came to represent the most extreme form of a controversial FBI policy to use invented terrorist plots to lure targets.  There has been no case as egregious as this. It is unique in the incentive the government provided. A quarter million dollars?  said Professor Karen Greenberg, a terrorism expert at Fordham University. The whole episode seemed born out WTC 1993 bombing case, which involved yet another informant working alongside officials.More below regarding the purported NYC bombing from ZeroHedge  NYC UNDER ATTACK?

23256,AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY: Who Really Killed JonBenét Ramsey?," Do roses know their thorns can hurt?    a quote attributed to JonBen t Ramsey from Lawrence Schiller s Perfect Murder, Perfect Town Shawn Helton 21st Century WireIt s been nearly 20 years since the cold-blooded murder of JonBen t Ramsey shocked America.  On December 26, 1996, the lifeless body of a 6-year-old girl, JonBen t Ramsey, was found brutally murdered in the basement of her family home. The grisly discovery stunned a quiet and affluent community in Boulder, Colorado and quickly became one of the most disturbing unsolved crimes in the United States over the past two decades. Photo Illustration Shawn Helton of 21WIREThe killing of JonBen t was an American tragedy and still to this day, it remains a haunting case and enigma.Below we ll examine some of the key elements surrounding the Ramsey investigation, along with some of the prevailing theories concerning JonBen t s homicide Throughout the course of this crime analysis, there will be references to a compilation of media reports, independent investigative reports, as well as the court case, Wolf v. Ramsey in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia which convened in 2003.The 2003 case stated that a Boulder journalist named Robert Christian Wolf filed a $50 million defamation suit against John Ramsey and wife Patsy Ramsey after being referred to by the family as a possible suspect in the death of JonBen t in the couple s controversial book, Death of Innocence.During the Wolf v. Ramsey court case, some shocking details surrounding JonBen t s murder were reviewed once again. Subsequently, John and Patsy Ramsey were sued in two separate defamation lawsuits (including Linda Hoffman-Pugh) after the publication of their controversial book about the murder of their daughter.  DARK HOLIDAY    The crime taped scene at the Ramsey residence in University Hill on December 26, 1996. (Image Source: eonline)Christmas in Boulder 1996JonBen t Ramsey was discovered dead in what has been referred to as the  wine cellar  of her parent s Boulder mansion just one day after Christmas.According to investigators, the official cause of the young child s death was asphyxia by strangulation associated with craniocerebral trauma.  The savage scene indicated a possible sexual assault based on DNA evidence collected.Court transcripts confirmed that around the time of JonBen t s death, an unknown object (possibly a flashlight) was used to cause blunt force trauma to her head. However, the strangulation came 45 minutes to two hours after the blow to the head (with the killer behind the victim).The initial inspection of JonBen t s body revealed that the child beauty pageant contestant was bound to a broken paintbrush, an improvised garrote with a slip knot that included some of her own hair. A closer forensic investigation would later uncover that the duck tape placed over JonBen t s mouth, allegedly contained hair from a beaver. Similarly, it was discovered that unidentified dark animal hairs were found on her hands. Nothing in the home matched the animal hair samples found on the duct tape.According to the The Colorado Bureau of Investigations, there were fibers found on the duct tape that were also similar to a jacket worn by JonBen t s mother on Christmas day.Those close to the case would later remark how many elements of the crime scene appeared to be staged  as the cord, body positioning, additional bodily trauma, as well as the white blanket covering JonBen t and the Barbie nightgown found near her, indicated manipulation after the crime occurred.In a report by the now retired forensic pathologist and medical examiner, Dr. Michael Doberson, The right side of [JonBen t s] face as well as on the lower left back are patterned injuries most consistent with the application of a stun gun.  According to additional court documents,  Male DNA was found under JonBenet s right hand fingernail that does not match that of any Ramsey. The same court documents also stated, Defendants also assert that male DNA was found under Jon-Benet s left hand fingernail, which also does not match that of any Ramsey,  and that male DNA was found on the deceased s underwear but did not match any other Ramsey family member.The Ramseys assert that JonBen t was last seen alive around 10pm on Christmas day after attending a Christmas party at the White family residence. Along with her brother Burke, the young girl was put to bed shortly after coming home from that party.JonBen t s time of death has remained undetermined, though autopsy results suggest that sometime between 10pm on Christmas night and the early hours of December 26th. Reports confirm that rigor mortis had set in on the body and an odor of decomposition had also been present. It would later be revealed that JonBen t had undigested pieces of pineapple still in her stomach and small intestine.According to other investigative reports, it s inconclusive whether the 6 year-old had the pineapple an hour or two prior to her death or earlier in the day.However, JonBen t was able digest cracked crab she ate at the Christmas party hosted by the White family, suggesting the pineapple was served later that night at home. Interestingly, JonBen t s mother Patsy, claimed to not remember giving her daughter fruit that day or night, even though the bowl containing the pineapple had her and her son s fingerprints on it. Burke Ramsey s fingerprints were also found on a nearby glass.  RANSOM PLOT?    Above is the apparent ransom note found by Patsy Ramsey. Oddly, John Ramsey had recently received a holiday bonus nearly the exact amount demanded in the note. (Image Source: pintrest)The Ransom Note & 911Early on December 26th, Patsy Ramsey (possibly in the same clothes), awoke at 5:33am and was said to have made her way down a staircase known to those familiar with the large house. Sitting on the stairs, the former Miss West Virginia found an apparent ransom note which stated that her abducted daughter was  safe and unharmed  but demanded $118,000 for her return.Strangely, this was the exact amount that Patsy s husband John received for a Christmas bonus in 1996, while working as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Access Graphics, a computer services company and a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin. After discovering that JonBen t was missing from her room, Patsy made a distressing 911 call to police at 5:52am, where Burke was said to have been heard talking in the background. However, John and Patsy maintained that their son was not yet awake at this time.Patsy then called her neighbor and close friends, Priscilla White, as well as John and Barbara Fernie, between 5:55am and 6am. Boulder police arrived at the scene some seven minutes later to find a frantic Patsy and an oddly clam John. There were no signs of forcible entry at the residence, which complicated the purported kidnapping plot.Below is an enhanced version of the Ramsey 911 call seen in a recent CBS series examining the case. The Ramsey 911 call on December 26th, has caused a tremendous amount of speculation about a possible family cover-up in the murder of JonBen t An in-depth investigative site revealed that Boulder Police Detective Melissa Hickman reviewed the 911 call and transcribed it after having it enhanced at the Aerospace Corporation. Similarly, Lawrence Schiller s book Perfect Murder, Perfect Town: The Uncensored Story of the JonBenet Murder and the Grand Jury s Search for the Final Truth, suggested that the voice of Burke Ramsey is supposedly heard in the back ground of the 911 call stating,  Please, what do I do?,  in addition to CBS s findings above.The December 26th phone call to police would be the second 911 call from the Ramsey home over a three-day period. The first was on December 23rd, during a party at the Ramseys house, which included guests said to be from the upper echelon of Boulder society. However, a complete list of attendees was not made public and the reason for the first 911 call was never fully explained as the unknown caller hung up without saying a word.Schiller s book Perfect Murder, Perfect Town, stated that Linda Hoffman-Pugh, the Ramseys longtime housekeeper named some of the families who attended the December 23rd Christmas party: At 5:30 P.M. Santa showed up. By then the Barnhills, the Fernies, the Stines, Pinky Barber, and the Whites, who came with Priscilla s parents, had all arrived. Maybe eight couples and their children. Most of the men gathered by the spiral staircase. John made drinks for everybody from the butler s kitchen. The kids played in the living room by the big Christmas tree. That s where Santa read his little verses about everyone. This year, Mrs. Claus was there too, Santa looked kind of sick. Flashing back to the alleged ransom note, FOX 13 reported that former Boulder police chief Mark Beckner, stated the following during a  Ask Me Anything  segment on Reddit. Here s a revealing passage from that discussion: The FBI told us they d never seen a 2.5 page ransom note, [and that] No note has ever been written at the scene, and then left at the scene with the dead victim at the scene, other than this case. In addition to Beckner s Reddit commentary, the online magazine The Federalist stated that,  The FBI s Child Abduction and Serial Killer Unit had noted that JonBen t s murderer almost certainly hadn t committed a murder before. They also concluded separately that the ransom note was written by someone intelligent but criminally unsophisticated. Continuing, the same article summarized another important aspect in the Ramsey case, lab tests also showed it was Patsy s Sharpie pen used to write the note. The pen used to write the note an FBI profiler estimates it took 21 minutes for the author to practice on the pad and then compose it was found in a cup with other Sharpies right next to the phone in the kitchen where Patsy kept them. It was very conscientious of the murderer to put everything back where he found it. Though Patsy was never conclusively proven to have had a hand in writing the purported ransom note, of those asked to give written samples, she was the only person police could not completely eliminate.According to a longtime FBI agent, the note contained deliberate mistakes and strange manipulative elements in an attempt to confuse authorities.The FBI was said to have arrived at the Ramsey house some fifteen minutes after the body was discovered. Schiller s Perfect Murder, Perfect Town, also noted the protocol of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the following manner: FBI s standard procedure is to investigate the parents and the immediate family first and then move outward in circles. Then would come people who had frequent access to the child babysitters and domestic help. The next circle would contain friends and business associates. The outermost circle would be strangers. The technique was to avoid leaping over these concentric circles too quickly. According to the Bureau of Justice statistics from 1980   2008, 78.1 percent of the time, offenders were not strangers to the victim, and in more than 56 percent of cases, the victim was at least acquainted with an offender. HOUSE OF HORROR   The police taped scene outside the Ramsey residence following the discovery of their murdered daughter. (Image Source: ajc)Spoiling the Scene Upon arriving at the Ramsey residence on December 26th, Boulder policeman Rick French, conducted a quick search of the house, looking for possible intruder exit points. French failed to search the wine cellar room where JonBen t would later be discovered, because he noticed that the wooden latch on the door was on the opposite side for a door exiting the house. Around this time, French was also given the apparent ransom note by the Ramseys. The two and a half page note, was later described as one of the longest ransom notes in the history of kidnapping cases in America.At least two searches were conducted by JonBen t s father John and family friend Fleet White, Priscilla s husband, in the Ramseys  basement sometime between 6:06   8:00am. Shortly after arriving at the Ramsey residence, Fleet searched the basement alone including the wine cellar where JonBen t s body was located within fifteen minutes of arriving. Documents would confirm the search effort in the following description, Mr. White also opened the door to the wine cellar room, but he could not see anything inside because it was dark and he could not find the light switch. Fleet then testified that a window in the basement playroom had been broken and that underneath that window, there was a suitcase and piece of broken glass.Early on investigators were concerned about the lack of debris and other forensic evidence in and around the window thought to have been used in the alleged abduction/murder plot.December 26th, at 6:45am, John calls and leaves a message for Michael Archuleta his pilot. At 7:00am, his 9 year-old son Burke was dressed and taken to the White residence. Also at this time, Rev. Rolland Hoverstock from St. John s Episcopalian Church arrived at the Ramsey residence.The UK s Guardian described other compelling forensic details noted at the house that day: Eventually, other details emerged which competed with the original picture. Though there was no sign of forced entry, there was that small broken window into the basement that had been left open. Though there were no footprints in the snow, there was no snow on the part of the lawn that would need to be crossed to get in through the window. There was a footprint near the body left by a Hi-Tec boot. There was a latent handprint on the doorframe that didn t match any of the Ramseys .   MAP OF MURDER    Here s a bird s eye graphic detailing the Ramsey s basement area and the hidden wine cellar room where JonBen t s body was found. (Image Source: denverpost.com)In the striking book Programmed to Kill by writer and researcher David McGowan, we see an examination of the Ramsey case in a chapter entitled Boulder. In the following passage, McGowan underscored that the crime scene had been mishandled from the beginning: For reasons that have never been adequately explained, the investigation was compromised from the very beginning. Officers inexplicably failed to secure the crime scene, allowing the family s pastor to come and go from the home. No effort was made to prevent contamination of any potential evidence. Detectives did not arrive on the scene until 8:10am, over two hours after the first patrol officers arrived. It took another twelve hours for the coroner to arrive (and once there, he reportedly spent just ten minutes examining the body and the crime scene). Detectives Linda Arndt and Fred Patterson arrived at the Ramsey s residence at 8:10am and are given a rundown of the scene by Officer French from the Boulder police department.Detective Arndt then prepped the Ramseys for the potential ransom phone call, tapping the house phone. Around this time, the police s team of victims  advocates who are skilled in dealing with trauma, arrive with breakfast food. Unfortunately, as was the case with many elements of the Ramsey crime scene, crucial evidence was potentially erased, as the team of advocates inadvertently wiped down parts of the kitchen.Arndt would later remark that there was no acknowledgement from anyone inside the house that the ransom phone call deadline came and went. John would later be seen examining the contents of his mail during the developing tragedy at his home.Detectives Arndt and Patterson sealed off JonBen t s bedroom some time around 10:30am but did not block off the entire house as a potential crime scene. In fact, friends and family moved freely throughout the house most of the day.At 10:30, Arndt calls for backup at least twice while left in the house alone with the Ramsey family and friends (seven in total), she is told that all officers are in a Boulder Police Department meeting and they received her message. Later a qualifier for the lapse was given by the BPD stating that they were short-staffed.At 1pm,  Arndt decided that John should do a  top to bottom  search of the house with specific instructions not to touch anything. John, Fleet and supposedly another family friend, John Fernie, trekked downstairs into the basement, during the tense wait for the alleged kidnappers to call   a call that never happened.John located JonBen t almost immediately at 1:05pm in the wine cellar hidden in the basement of the Ramsey house. Upon discovering JonBen t, John reportedly ripped the duct tape from her mouth and untied her hands bringing her lifeless body upstairs. Arndt then grabbed the young girl placing her near the family Christmas tree after a strange nonverbal exchange with John. Patsy was also said to have grieved over the body at this time.While it was a undeniably an emotional situation, Arndt made a mental note of the disturbance to the crime scene as this was not officially a homicide.Twenty minutes later, after additional officers secure the house and the forensic team returns, John places a phone call to his personal pilot but is instructed by police to stay in Boulder.Sometime later, testimony revealed a time discrepancy over the timeline of John s basement search, as it appeared to contradict other time frames of the initial crime scene investigation. Some researchers contend that John perhaps searched the basement before 6am based on statements given to authorities.Detective Arndt attempted to question Patsy further but the family s lawyer Mike Bynum stepped in blocking the inquiry into his client. The Ramseys did not give formal police interviews until four months after JonBen t s murder.According to The Daily Mail s report,  They also assembled a team of private investigators, a public relations guru, an ex-FBI criminal profiler and two handwriting experts to look at the ransom note, arguing that the local police had botched the initial investigation. In a 1999, during a Good Morning America interview with Detective Arndt, described John s discovery of JonBen t,  I decided that everything made sense in that instance. And, um, I knew what happened. I mean that s, I knew what happened to her. Below is Arndt s interview on ABC News, discussing the behavioral anomalies she witnessed at the Ramsey residence on December 26th During the course of that interview Arndt remarked how long it seemed before officers returned to the house following her radio to police, prompting the detective to become fearful of her own life waiting for backup, after witnessing the severe bodily trauma to JonBen t.In May of 1997, Detective Arndt and Detective Melissa Hickman were dropped from the case.  MEDIA SPOTLIGHT    The body language displayed John and Patsy Ramsey appeared to belie the murder of their child. Furthermore, they were never seen consoling one another by police the day their daughter was discovered murdered. (Image Source: crime.about)Casting SuspicionOn December 27th, it was reported that Patsy s friend Pam Griffin, the seamstress that designed JonBenet s pageant costumes went to comfort Patsy, who was grieving at the Fernie residence. Here s a passage describing that encounter in a Newsweek report three years after the murder of JonBen t: At the Boulder home of John and Barbara Fernie, friends of the Ramseys , Pam, a former registered nurse, touched Patsy s skin and realized she was dehydrated. She brought Patsy some water and made her drink it.  You need to brush your hair,  Pam told her.  You need to lie down a little bit.  But Patsy stood up to greet each new person who arrived to offer condolences, and as she did, tears streamed down her face. Hours later, Patsy finally took Pam s advice and lay down in the bedroom. Patsy reached up and touched Pam s face.  Couldn t you fix this for me?  she asked. Pam thought she was delirious. It was as if Patsy were asking her to fix a ripped seam.  Patsy said something like,  We didn t mean for that to happen ,  Pam would say later. Pam couldn t say why, but she remembered feeling as if Patsy knew who killed JonBenet but was afraid to say. Back in the spring of 1996, Griffin put local dance instructor, Kit Andre in touch with Patsy to help teach JonBen t a routine for the pageant circuit. Andre would later be quoted by media, stating the following: She was a fabulous child,  I told Patsy at JonBenet s memorial service in Boulder.  She was a star.  I never saw JonBenet in a pageant. Never saw her do the routine I taught her until I saw that pageant video on TV. I ve looked at that video several times. They made JonBenet look like a clown. Someone else taught her those pseudo-adult movements, the provocative walk, the poses, all of it. The Daily Mail described the family preoccupation with the child beauty pageant circuit. Adding to that, family visitors noted that JonBenet s room was filled with pageant trophies rather than toys: Patsy later insisted that while JonBenet loved taking part in pageants, it was just a little hobby. Experts immediately pointed to the coaching, dancing, singing, music and beauty sessions   along with the outrageous cost of outfits   that made it an almost full-time occupation.   FAMILY TIES    The Ramsey s and White family on a ski trip. (Image Source: westword)The case most certainly took a different turn once the police had indicated that the Ramseys themselves would also be investigated as possible suspects. Right away, the Ramseys  lawyered-up  and hired an formidable legal defense team. Some twenty months after the brutal murder of JonBenet, John Ramsey s friend Fleet White, wrote an open letter to  the people of Colorado  that questioned the investigation by Boulder police and Boulder District Attorney Alex Hunter: After JonBen t Ramsey was killed in Boulder nearly twenty months ago, her parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, immediately hired prominent Democrat criminal defense attorneys with the law firm of Haddon, Morgan and Foreman. This firm and its partners have close professional, political and personal ties to prosecutors, the Denver and Boulder legal and judicial communities, state legislators, and high-ranking members of Colorado government, including Gov. Roy Romer. The investigation of her death has since been characterized by confusion and delays. Continuing, White outlined a larger conspiracy concerning the Ramsey case: During the course of the investigation, the district attorney has used inexplicable methods including the recruitment of magazine writers and tabloids to leak information concerning the case and to needle witnesses,  suspects , and police detectives. White also mentioned the resignation of Boulder police detective Steve Thomas on August 6, 1998, after publicly accusing the District Attorney of  obstructing  the investigation into the Ramsey murder case. Torn Between Two Theories Something that continued to plague the Ramsey investigation, was that authorities were not able to reconcile the two different types of crime theories, one of the brutal killer and one of the ransom seeking kidnapper, based on the evidence presented.In 2000, Boulder s Daily Camera news, reported that the White family would be drawn even further into the Ramsey case, due to a California woman s descriptive allegations of an expansive child abuse ring. Her claims initially garnered attention because she allegedly knew John and Patsy Ramsey through Fleet: The White family did come in for more public scrutiny than some Ramsey associates during the star-crossed investigation.In his statement, Becker noted that, in 2000,  The police department did investigate allegations made by a California woman to District Attorney Alex Hunter, as reported in the press, that were intended to cast suspicion on the White family. The department found no evidence to support the unfounded allegations. There has never been any evidence to link the White family to the JonBenet Ramsey homicide. The Camera in February 2000 reported that a 38-year-old woman had told Hunter that, when she was young, she had been ritually and sexually abused in a manner similar to the way JonBenet Ramsey died. Prior to the article mentioned above Barrie Hartman, editor for the Daily Camera for 18 years, added the following details concerning the woman interviewed by Boulder law enforcement which describe a deeper level abuse: The woman has described to police years of sexual and physical abuse in California homes at the hands of adults who stayed at holiday and other parties after other guests had left for the evening. Then, she said, another  party,  one of sexual abuse for the gratification of a select group of adults, would begin. Though Fleet White was cleared as a suspect in 1997 and officially exonerated in 2008 along with John Ramsey, publicly scrutiny has remained to this day.In 2014, even though Boulder District Attorney Stan Garnett declined to write yet another letter of exoneration for the Whites, which would have been the fourth such public decree regarding the family.According to reports, in 2002, former Detective Lou Smit who believed in John and Patsy s innocence,  named a convicted Oregon sex offender Gary Oliva as his prime suspect after discovering the drifter had been in Boulder in December 1996. But Oliva s DNA did not match samples taken from the body. Throughout the last 20 years, at least 140 different men have been considered by investigative authorities, including convicted sex offender John Mark Karr, who gave a false confession that was later cleared through a DNA analysis.Additional investigative details state that, DNA samples from 1.6 million offenders   86,000 in Colorado alone   have been checked over the past five years and forensics experts update those files once a week. It was recently revealed in April of 2016, that Ollie Gray, a private investigator hired by John and Patsy Ramsey claimed to have named the killer as one Michael Helgoth. The story implicated Helgoth, a 26-year-old whose family owned a junkyard on the edge of the city. According to an interview with The Daily Mail, Gray stated the following,  Based on what we know now, I believe Helgoth and his accomplices committed the crime. There s no doubt about it.  The Helgoth story gained traction because John Kenady, a former employee of Helgoth s, said his employer allegedly taped a video of JonBen t s death. Kenady supposedly tried to reach police some twenty times according to the Ramseys private investigator.The Daily Mail continued: Then, on February 13, 1997, Alex Hunter, who was then the district attorney, held a press conference where he spoke to JonBenet s unknown killer, saying;  The list of suspect narrows. Soon there will be no one on the list but you. Helgoth died of an apparent suicide two days later at his home. Kenady believes he was murdered by an accomplice or accomplices who were with him when he killed JonBenet. The gun was found on Helgoth s right side, but the bullet hole goes from left to right. It doesn t make sense why someone would commit suicide in that manner,  said Kenady. Below is a documentary featuring former Boulder Detective Steve Thomas   regarding a bed-wetting rage theory revolving around JonBen t s murder (Thomas  testimony is at 24:20) Ramsey Case Oddities In 1998, the NY Times reported that a private detective named Brett Sawyer had been convicted of paying a photo lab tech for  20 autopsy photographs  and reselling to The Globe newspaper for $5,500. Naturally, this caused quite a public outcry, stirring questions about morality, societal behavior and the media s role in sensationalizing violence in America.On an intriguing note, in 2001, the Daily Camera reported that the Ramsey house s address would be changed: [The] Tudor where JonBen t Ramsey was found dead nearly five years ago have discarded the 755 15th St. address plate. Small adhesive-backed, black numbers   749   now adorn the mail slot to the right of the front door,  and that  Before the address change was granted, city officials contacted 18 different agencies   including emergency responders, utility companies and the post office, to determine if such a change would be practical. In 2007, it was reported that a year after Patsy Ramsey died of ovarian cancer, husband John was for a short time reported by some publications to be romantic with Beth Holloway, the mother of Natalee Holloway who disappeared in 2005 after allegedly being  abducted. Other case oddities have included the apparent meaning of the acronym signature at the bottom of the alleged ransom note that read S.B.T.C, something of which that caused quite a stir. Here s a 2011 FOX News report that has only added to the confusion, Some journalists erroneously believed that phrase was a war reference to John Ramsey s training in the Philippines at Subic Bay Naval Base (they believed it could mean Subic Bay Training Center).  However, according to the Chicago Tribune in January of 1997,  John Ramsey, 53, spent March 1968 through November 1969 assigned to the Navy Public Works Center at Subic Bay Training Center, according to the Bureau of Navy Personnel in Washington. In another bizarre and uncanny twist to the Ramsey murder case, Bill McReynolds the man who dressed up as Santa Claus on the night of December 23rd at the Ramsey house, had is own daughter abducted exactly twenty-two years (December 26th, 1974) to the date of JonBen t s murder. Strangely, he and his wife purportedly wrote a screenplay called Hey Rube (possibly named after the circus cry for help) that dealt with the brutal murder of a child in a similar manner to JonBen t.In the early days of the Ramsey case there was also concern about Randy Simmons, a child photographer well-known on the pageant circuit.In 1999, well-known Denver-based journalist Stephen Singular wrote a book about the murder of JonBen t, which investigated the exploitation of children and the dark and seedy elements potentially connected to the brutal crime in Boulder.In terms of historical context concerning Singular s theories, the book by former Nebraska state Senator John De Camp entitled, The Franklin Cover-up, comes to mind. The Cover-up was a scathing expose  that implicated politicians, judges, those in the military, police, as well as members of  the intelligence community   for the subsequent abduction of numerous children over the course of many years, including connections to the wider Boys Town scandal. Former CIA director William Colby wrote the preface to De Camp s courageous book, lending even more credibility to its claims. Decamp had previously been an aide for Colby, who became disillusioned by his time in the CIA.You have to wonder, was JonBen t also a victim of a larger criminal conspiracy?  LAST PICTURE    The last photo of JonBen t alive. Here she is with her mother Patsy on Christmas morning 1996. (Image Source: dailymail.co.uk)Only Theories, No ConclusionTheories about JonBen t s killer or killers, have ranged from an unknown intruder, members of her family, family friends, a larger network of abuse, a wandering criminal who may have acted alone, or someone who played a role in a potential murder-for-hire scenario. But after all these years, every one of these so-called theories has one thing in common: the investigation seems to lead straight back to questions regarding John and Patsy s official story   despite the couple s exoneration.Adding fuel to the fire, for the first time in public,JonBen t s brother, Burke Ramsey, recently discussed the murder of his sister during an exclusive three-part interview with Dr. Phil McGraw, something which has caused more speculation about the tragic and troubling case.Interestingly, since airing a six-hour docu-series called The Case of: JonBen t Ramsey , CBS is now being sued by Burke Ramsey, for the shows suggested conclusion that he may have been responsible for his sister s homicide.In 2013, the Daily Camera revealed that an  unprosecuted grand jury indictment revealed the grand jury prepared charges of child abuse resulting in death and accessory to a crime for both John and Patsy Ramsey in the death of their daughter,  and that  Alex Hunter, the Boulder County district attorney at the time, never signed the true bill, apparently believing he could not successfully prosecute due to a lack of evidence. The tragic story of JonBen t continues, a portrait of innocence shattered   a truly unbelievable crime still unsolved 20 years later.READ MORE TRUE CRIME NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire True Crime FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE and its work by Subscribing and becoming a Member @ 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"September 23, 2016"

23258,Russian Military: US Coalition Predator Drone Spotted at Time & Place of Syria UN Aid Convoy Attack,"21st Century Wire says Despite proclamations by US official, details of the attack on the UN Aid Convoy yesterday are still sketchy. With no evidence to hand John Kerry and  unnamed  US officials claim that  they know  the Russian attacked the UN aid convoy passing through a  rebel  terrorist-held highway while travelling out of West Aleppo and heading southwest towards al-Foua and Kefraya villages. From the onset, both Russian and Syrian military stated they were not involved in this incident, but US maintain they are the guilty parties. John Kerry blaming Russia for mysterious attack on UN Convoy.The US insistence to blame Russia for attacking this UN Aid Convoy appears to be a desperate deflect-and-divert public relations move to mask the fact the Washington destroyed its own ceasefire agreement on Saturday when it massacred over 70 Syrian Army soldiers and wounding another 100, in a sustained one hour-long attack involving multiple aircraft from the US, UK, Australia and Denmark. Because of that US-led airstrike, ISIS was allowed to advance immediately forward towards taking the key strategic city of Deir al-Zour. In spite of the unlikely coincidence, Washington claimed this was all just  a mistake. In addition, US Coalition and Gulf-backed  rebel  terrorists had already broke the Russia-US ceasefire multiple times, and are also on record boasting earlier in the week how terrorist-held East Aleppo militants would refuse any UN aid convoy that crossed their sights.Did the US and its  rebel  forces on the ground orchestrate another false flag event designed to avoid condemnation of Saturday s massacre? Our western colleages are putting their best efforts to hype up the situation and  blur  the tragedy in Deir ez-Zor and to distract the international community from Al-Nusra s advance on Aleppo and thus cover the US incompetence in distinguishing between the  moderate  opposition and terrorists in Syria.    Russian spokeperson.Now, new evidence suggests that the US Coalition may be misleading the world about their true intentions  RTThe Russian Defense Ministry says that a US coalition drone was in the vicinity of a humanitarian convoy when it was attacked outside Aleppo. According to the Russian military, the unmanned aircraft was a Predator drone. On the evening of September 19, in that specific region, a drone belonging to the international condition, which had taken off from the Incirlik air base in Turkey, was flying at a height of 3,600 meters and traveling at around 200 kilometers per hour,  said Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov. The object was in the area around the town of Urm Al-Kubra, where the convoy was a few minutes before it caught fire,  Konashenkov added.  It left after about 30 minutes. The Defense Ministry spokesman said he wanted to point out that, as was the case with the tragedy on September 17 which saw US-led coalition airstrike kill and injure 200 people, the Russians would not be making any unfounded allegations. Only the owners know what exactly the drone was doing at this particular area at that exact time,  he added.Moscow says it has provided all the data it possesses regarding the attack on the convoy, which was carrying aid to rebel-held areas in Aleppo, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at a UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday. There was another unacceptable provocation on September 19   the shelling of a humanitarian convoy near Aleppo,  he said.  I am confident that such coincidences require serious analysis and an investigation. On September 19, a humanitarian convoy consisting of 31 trucks was attacked while heading to Aleppo. According to the Red Cross, 20 civilians and one aid worker died as a result. Initial reports claimed the convoy had been targeted by an airstrike. Later the UN said all it could confirm was that the convoy was attacked.On Tuesday, the Russian Defense Ministry reiterated that neither it nor the Syrian military had launched airstrikes on the convoy. Russian and Syrian warplanes did not carry out any airstrikes on a UN humanitarian aid convoy in the southwest of Aleppo,  Konashenkov said in a statement. He added that the military had studied video footage of the convoy, which appeared to rule out that an airstrike took place. We have closely studied the video footage from where the incident took place and we did not find any signs of any ammunition having hit the convoy. There are no craters, while the vehicles have their chassis intact and they have not been severely damaged, which would have been the case from an airstrike,  Konashenkov said. All of the video footage demonstrates that the convoy caught fire, which strangely happened almost at exactly at the same time as militants started a large-scale offensive on Aleppo. In a statement Konashenkov said Moscow was compelled to disclose the  sensitive details  in response to the accusations made by US deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes, who has laid the blame for the attack on the aid convoy on Russia. This type of drone can not only monitor the situation, but also guide ground weapons to their targets and inflict surgical airstrikes at objects located on the ground by itself,  the Russian spokesman explained Read more at RTREAD MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Syria Files",Middle-east,"September 21, 2016"

23260,‘We’re Just Not Into Her’ – Hillary Clinton Losing Support of Millennials,"Patrick Henningsen  21st Century WireWhat s up with the millennials? The Clinton campaign may have felt a jolt after seeing the front page headline from this morning s Wall Street Journal which read, Millennials Have Cooled on Hillary Clinton, Forcing a Campaign Reset. Traditionally, the 21 to 35 year old age bracket (born 1980-1993 in our epoch) has been a bastion of the Democratic Party. According to a recent Quinnipiac poll, Hillary Clinton s lead over Republican Donald J. Trump among under 35 s plummeted in the month of August from 25 points  down to only 5 points. Pretty shocking, but even more so in a week that has seen a Hillary health scare, resulting in Trump surging ahead of Clinton in multiple national polls, and also in perennially pivotal electoral patches like Florida and Ohio.So what s up? Why can t Hillary chill with the millennials, like Barack once did?Back when she was battling Bernie Sanders in the primaries, Clinton pulled out all the stops for the millennials   even promising America s students a  debt free  college experience including free university tuition. Somehow, Hillary s sizzle has failed to produce the Bern with this crucial demographic. As much as they would love for it to be true, even the most optimistic of students knows that free tuition for all is nothing more than pie in the sky, with some left feeling patronized in a way that voters have come to expect from desperate politicians making increasingly desperate promises on the campaign trail these days. What s really being overlooked by Democrat Party elites here though, is the uncomfortable truth that the old party ways simply aren t working anymore, and the Clinton campaign is not viewed as transformative (as Colin Powell calls it) and thus, millennials are finding it difficult to get behind it.So if they are no longer with Hillary, where are they going? Definitely not to the GOP. Trump is a non-starter when it comes to millennials, many of which are already registered Democrats. No offense to Trump supporters, but that s just the way it is   there s simply not enough young deplorable jugend to go around. Both Trump and Clinton are two of the oldest potential president elects ever to face off in a general election, at 70, 69 yrs old respectively. Instead, a sizeable number of young swing(ing) voters are flocking to Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, who is currently polling at around 9% nationally, and also to Green Party candidate Jill Stein who is polling around 4%.One aspect worth noting here is that, unlike their generational predecessors, 21st century millennials are not afraid to take a risk on what they might view as a  political start-up  like the Libertarian or Green party. While traditional two-party system dinosaurs dream of squeezing rich donors at fundraising dinners, millennials dream of Podemos and crowdfunding the next revolution. But digital Jerusalem is still a ways off, and here is where idealism inevitably clashes with hard-core political reality: with the Trump-Clinton race in a near dead heat, millennials who have migrated into those alternative Johnson and Stein camps will indirectly decide the 2016 Election in much the same way that Independent candidate Ralph Nader did in 2000 and to a lesser extent in 2004, although it s not so easy to calculate between Clinton and Trump exactly who will be the chief beneficiary from that alternative displacement vote. CHILLERY: Clinton is struggling to excite the millennial voters (Illustration: TrumpNews)There is another spanner in the Democratic machine which no one is talking about, and one which could certainly hurt Hillary Clinton, and help Donald Trump on November 8th. One pronounced crimp in the Clinton juggernaut came as a result of the Wikileaks  DNC email leaks which revealed how, in its effort to shoe-in Clinton ahead of this past summer s party convention, the Democratic Party conspired to railroad the Bernie Sanders campaign  effectively killing its mercurial millennial phenomenon. Old party hacks might not understand why this is so important because they are so wrapped up in time-honored Tammany Hall traditions, but to young idealistic millennials, this party betrayal would not only be viewed as unfair, but also as undemocratic, and rightly so. As a result, a nationwide write-in campaign for Sanders as President has begun to pick up steam. If this pulls in 2%, or even 1%   away from Hillary s tally, especially in the key battleground states like Pennsylvania, Arizona or Michigan, then the race becomes even tighter still, and more unpredictable.This excerpt from the Reason report (below) should be the most sobering of all for Democrats, and it reveals the source of their fatal disconnect:A Reason-Rupe poll of millennials in 2014 found 66 percent of them believing government was wasteful and inefficient even as many said they planned to vote Democrat in that year and in 2016. The drop off in support for Democrats is unsurprising, given that the rhetoric about government that Democrats deploy does not match the reality on the ground.In other word: the Democrats are as addicted to lying as any other political organization, and this cannot be fixed   it s an institutional thing.In order to shore-up the millennial gap, the Democratic Party has dispatched its cohort of  rock stars  to college campuses across the country in order to woo millennials. Michelle Obama, Elizabeth Warren, and even Sanders (how Bernie could go out stumping after the DNC Leaks is pretty amazing in itself) have been sent like missionaries to the four corners of the country, in order to try and win back those millions of lost liberal souls, and lead them back into the party flock.To millennials, Bernie Sanders  primary election loss dashed their hopes in much the same way Ron Paul supporters felt in 2012  betrayed by a collusion between party mob bosses and the mainstream media. In both cases, aside from the obvious corruption, what was really dashed was the idealistic view that their generation had a real and meaningful stake in US politics and could even elevate its own candidate in a national election. Millions of previously disengaged voters finally found an original voice that resonated with their generation, and to see that voice crushed by political insiders and media operatives is a bitter pill to swallow. In America s winner-take-all system of Presidential elections, there is only room for one party winner   a reality which will continue to frustrate young voters going forward, many of whom are well aware of parliamentary systems in other nation states, and systems which appear to allow more plurality when it comes to choosing a viable political leader. Like it or not, managing those global expectations in terms of party and leadership choice is a reality that America will have to contend with in the future.With so many free radicals  still orbiting this election, it will be tricky to project a clear winner. Shades of 2000 perhaps, but this year there will be no hanging chads, but maybe something worse. Half the voters will be blaming either Obama (vote rigging), or Putin (vote hacking), as a reaction to any perceived electoral stitch-up (see #HashTagHell).It s a tricky year for the bookies, but one thing you can bet on is a serious fall-out after election day. So brace yourself, because in case you haven t noticed, many Americans are viewing this election as a true do or die  moment.In a United States already polarized along very pronounced partisan lines, whichever the result, one side will be baying for blood. That s just the way it is this year.Author Patrick Henningsen is journalist and geopolitical analyst for 21WIRE and host of the SUNDAY WIRE weekly radio show and also ON THE QT podcast@21WIRE.TV. Here s more useful analysis on the 2016  millennial dynamic  from Ed Krayewski at Reason ReasonA number of new polls show Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson doing very well with millennials and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton underperforming with the same demographic that helped President Obama build winning coalitions in 2008 and 2012.A New York Times/CBS poll shows 26 percent of voters under the age of 29 supporting Johnson and a further 10 percent supporting Green presidential nominee Jill Stein. Similarly, a Quinnipiac poll shows Johnson at 29 percent of young voters, and Stein at 15. In that poll, Clinton barely edges out Johnson among young voters, getting 31 percent. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is at 26 percent among that demographic in the poll. Further, a Global Strategy Group poll of millennials in 11 battleground states found 73 percent of millennials saying that Trump was a racist, and just 38 percent supporting Clinton in a 4-way matchup.The results have yielded unsurprising hand-wringing from older liberals who feel the vote of millennials belongs to them. Clara Jeffrey, editor-in-chief of Mother Jones, tweeted that she has  never hated millennials more  in response to the NYT/CBS poll, which earned refreshing responses from millennials Continue this story at ReasonREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"September 17, 2016"
23261,Not a Journalist: CNN’s Brian Stelter Manages Clinton Health Cover-up,"21st Century Wire says CNN s Brian Stelter hosts a show facetiously titled,  Reliable Sources , where Stelter pretends to be a hard-hitting  journalist , but the reality couldn t be further from the truth. Based on CNN and Stelter s reporting so far, their only  sources  appear to be those of the Clinton campaign s damage control team. IMAGE: CNN s Brian Stelter host of  Reliable Sources . Normally, Stelter, who describes himself as a  media analysis expert , is able to play the part of journalist partly because it s easy to blend in at CNN which probably employs more political operatives and pseudo-journalists than any other media outlet in the US, but in the high stakes game that is the 2016 election season, Stelter s cardboard facade has quickly fallen apart, in full view. Buckling under pressure while trying to manage Clinton campaign messaging on CNN, Stelter then lost it, attacking two leading nationally syndicated radio hosts, Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh, accusing them of wanting Hillary Clinton  dead,  (yes that s right, he said dead) during the nationally aired PBS Charlie Rose segment with fill-in host Andrew Ross Sorkin.Listen to the rebuttal by Rush Limbaugh: The HillMedia reporters are a relatively new breed. A breed that basically came along during the last decade when digital media came into existence, creating hundreds of more avenues for actual reporting to exist, and therefore keep an eye on.The job of media reporter is fairly straightforward: Observe the industry in all of its forms. And when good or bad reporting happens, simply call it out.If a police force is a parallel of the Fourth Estate, a media reporter exists in that context as Internal Affairs, as a check and balance for those who are supposed to speak truth to power.But lately it appears that even Internal Affairs/media reporters are compromised, biased and even dishonest. Exhibit A is CNN s Brian Stelter in his reporting on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton s health issues, or per his consistent narrative for weeks, total lack of issues.Sunday was an active news day well outside of coverage of the 15th anniversary of 9/11: Clinton left a ceremony at Ground Zero early. And Fox News s Rick Leventhal   as solid a news reporter as they come out there   first went to air of Clinton s unexpected departure.From there, Leventhal was alone in his report citing a Clinton health episode for leaving early. The Clinton campaign wasn t talking. Other news organizations were waiting for another outlet or the campaign to come forward to verify before even cautiously broaching it.But shortly after 11:00 a.m. on CNN, Stelter broke away from his planned segment on  Reliable Sources  to break the news, via CNN s Jeff Zeleny, that Clinton had indeed become  overheated  during the 9/11 event under comfortable conditions (76 degrees at the time, mild breeze, low humidity).Here is video of Clinton attempting to enter her secure vehicle: Sunday RCP headline: CNN s Stelter to Media: Do Not Give Oxygen To  Conspiracy Theories  That Hillary Clinton Is  Secretly Ill BRIAN STELTER, RELIABLE SOURCES: Very worrisome news to hear, obviously, Jeff. As someone who covers the Clinton campaign everyday, what can you tell us about how frequently Clinton may have any health issues. Because obviously for years, there have been conspiracy theories online promoted by conservative websites saying that she is secretly ill. The campaign denied that and her physician said she is fit to serve as president. JEFF ZELENY, CNN: Indeed, her physician said she is fit to serve as president. She s released more medical information than her rival has of course but still has not released all of her records that all candidates have had over the years.Now, this certainly is going to prompt and renew and raise more questions about her health potentially here. She is 68 years old. She will turn 69 in October, before election day. It has, you know, we have seen it a lot over recent weeks, you know, some selected images and pictures and video of her either stumbling  BRIAN STELTER: Taken out of context.ZELENY: Taken out of context, yes. And I can tell you, Brian, I cover her a lot day in and day out on the campaign trail. Her schedule is very aggressive. We hear Donald Trumpoften saying,  Oh, she is taking a nap in the middle of the day.  That s not true. She has a very rigorous campaign schedule.( ) Stelter later connected with Zeleny for the following exchange   which had nothing to do with the episode Clinton experienced on Sunday that showed her knees buckling while falling into her security van with aides catching her before potentially injuring herself   around an older tabloid photo instead of discussing the situation at hand.Translation: Nothing really to see here, so let s deflect the conversation to a completely irrelevant point.STELTER:  You know, they had that horrible   let s be honest, Jeff, they had this horrible photo on the cover of that supermarket tabloid. Clearly, Hillary was Photoshopped in the picture. I thought it was disgusting.And yet, even though there are these conspiracy theories, which we should not give oxygen to, saying that she is secretly ill, suggesting she is on her deathbed, which we can she is not, there are legitimate questions to ask by reporters. And I think that s the distinction here to make.ZELENY: Right. It is a distinction, no doubt about it. Like I said, she has released more information than Donald Trump has, but both of them have released far less than John McCain did and Barack Obama did, than Mitt Romney and Barack Obama did, going back much beyond that.But the picture on the tabloid did looked doctored. I see her most every day. That looked nothing like her. And she has joked about it, Brian. I think we saw her on TV STELTER: Yes, good point.ZELENY:   a couple weeks ago saying, you know, look, they ve predicted that I would be on my deathbed by October and I m still here. So she has made humor of this. And I think that this could go one of two ways here. If the other   if her critics keep this up and criticize her, this could certainly motivate and inspire some of her supporters as well here.But we see her waving there, again. She s scheduled to go to California tomorrow. She will be on the West Coast for three days this week. As of now, her schedule is going forward here, Brian.On Thursday, for example, I flew with her all day as she left the airport in Westchester around 10:00 a.m. after a press conference and we returned at 11:00 p.m. She had a couple different campaign stops, a couple different fundraising stops and working along the way. So she is keeping up a rigorous pace here.But there are going to be questions about her health. In this incident, this episode, this situation this morning in Manhattan is just the latest example of that. The fact the Clinton campaign putting out this statement this morning saying that she felt overheated at Ground Zero and was taken to her daughter s apartment certainly is the information we have right now at this hour, Brian. The report would end there.The trip to California has since been cancelled.Takeaway: Stelter never broaches during any of these live reports   big ones considering the news here   that other prominent doctors, including President Obama s ex-physician of more than two decades   made the recommendation recently that Clinton should take a neurological exam.Obama s physician, who gave him a clean bill of health before the 2008 election and is widely respected, was Dr. David Scheiner from 1987 until his election in 2008. Scheiner isn t a Trump fan, but instead a Clinton supporter who said the Republican nominee  scares the devil out of him. There are a number of questions I have,  said Dr. Scheiner to CNN s Erin Burnett in mid-August.  First of all, she s also 68 years old, and while I think that letter was well-written and very professional, unlike Dr. Bornstein s [Donald Trump s doctor], it s not enough. For example, she s on Coumadin, a medication to prevent blood clots,  he continued.  You have to monitor that and it says she s being monitored regularly. I d like to know how well she s being controlled. That s a difficult drug to use. But here s the part Stelter   a media reporter whose job it is to present the full story   has curiously omitted in his numerous television appearances pontificating on the topic of Clinton s health which he has continually dismissed as conspiracy theories: Also, I think she should have had a neurological examination, a thorough neurological examination in 2016,  recommended Scheiner.  We know what happens to football players who have had concussions, how they begin to lose some of their cognitive ability, I think both [Trump and Clinton] should release their records. On Twitter, I asked Stelter   who had repeatedly made the argument that any questions raised about Clinton s health status are strictly those of Drudge, Fox s Sean Hannity, Breitbart and the alt-right   why he has ignored the prognosis of the president s own ex-physician who made said recommendation on CNN primetime to much press reaction afterward:@brianstelter The former ex-physician of the president saying Hillary Clinton should have a neurological exam on CNN air is cherry-picking?  Joe Concha (@JoeConchaTV) September 11, 2016In reviewing transcripts of several Stelter appearances on the topic, the media reporter and critic not only has failed to present Dr. Scheiner s conclusion, but also none of the other top doctors who have come forward to state Clinton needs further medical analysis, scrutiny and transparency as well   and there are plenty to cite.Short version: The  conspiracy theories  that Stelter has characterized in the form of reporting dozens of times on air and in print around Clinton s health had gone well beyond right-wing media and Trump surrogates before Sunday s episode and should have been a legitimate concern worthy of questioning, as noted several times in this space over the past few weeks Continue this story at the HillREAD MORE ABOUT PROBLEMS AT CNN NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire CNN Files",Middle-east,"September 16, 2016"

23264,No Longer a Fantasy: Could Hillary Clinton Actually Drop Out of the Race?,"21st Century Wire says US Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton is reported to have fainted during a major 9/11 Memorial service in New York City this past Sunday. She was promptly removed from the event by her campaign staff, but video footage later emerged showing Clinton being carried into her custom transport van.Now the media is buzzing with the question: is Hillary Clinton fit enough for the Oval Office? More importantly, can she stay on the campaign trail?As expected, the Clinton campaign is vehemently downplaying any health concerns, insisting that the former Secretary of State is  absolutely fine. The following is a video mix of this bizarre campaign scene, where Mrs. Clinton is lifted by multiple staffers and security into her van, and also notice at the 48 second mark where a small item drops from her right pant leg onto the pavement below. Watch:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCx0x0rigeQ . What would happen if she bowed out? Who would replace her? Is this a real possibility, or is this simply the latest in a long line of sensational rightwing media reports designed to further distract and divert the American public away from important key issues facing America?Here is former Huffington Post journalist David Seaman, who was recently fired and his work censored (and scrubbed from the internet) by the Huff Post for reporting on Clinton s health issues. Watch as he reveals Wikileaks  Clinton Email Archive,  which reveal additional information Clinton s health problems:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ren0vHuq-1A . Probing further into the possibility of Hillary Clinton actually dropping from the US Presidential race is award-winning health journalist and media analyst Jon Rappoport  Jon Rappoport No More Fake NewsI ve written about her health problems before, including the blood-thinning Coumadin she s taking. And the blood clots. And the advisory against flying, because new life-threatening blood clots can occur.I wrote and I still say Democrat power players would go along with electing her even if she was dragged into the Oval Office dead on arrival. They don t care.After Hillary s fainting spell at the 9/11 memorial, the Washington Post, that organ of unquestioned truth, grants that it s now acceptable to ask polite questions about her health. Well done, boys. You re really going out on a limb. Thanks so much.I think it s time for major media to take an overt stand about Hillary:  She may be very sick, dangerously so, but it s still a crime to emphasize that because it s sexist, and besides, untoward publicity could allow Trump to slip into the White House, and besides, our news organization has donated to the Clinton Foundation, and besides, she s Hillary and we all know and love her and we don t want to think about something bad happening to her because then we would cry. I would accept that statement. Hillary s public coughing fits. The physical instability. The fainting. The handler, Todd Madison, walking out on stage, putting his hand on her, telling her to keep talking, as if she s forgotten what s going on. You have to conclude her doctors have tried everything they can to keep her upright and functioning, and if this is best they can do, she s in bad shape.Hillary dropping out of the race for the Oval Office is no longer a fantasy. It could happen. If it does, the media will swing into gear and try to demand a delay in the election.There is no basis for such a demand, because both major Parties can pick their candidate on their own terms. The Democrats, for example, as we ve seen, can rig the vote and secretly back Hillary from the beginning and cook up propaganda to defeat Bernie Sanders. They can choose a slew of so-called super-delegates who owe nothing to the voters and, instead, support whoever they want to (Hillary). So if she drops out, the Democrat leaders can simply decide, again, without consulting voters, who the substitute is. Kaine? Biden? Sanders? Elizabeth Warren? Michelle Obama? Rachel Maddow? Karl Marx?No doubt, some progressive pundit will suggest Obama should stay in office for a while, because he has the experience, he s Presidential, he s done such a magnificent job in his two terms, his mission is unfinished (he must get the TPP treaty ratified), we need him to continue the dialogue on race in the post-racial society, he knows how to bypass Congress with a blizzard of executive orders, he can figure out a way to admit millions more illegal immigrants to these shores, he backs Black Lives Matter, and he knows how to talk about fake employment numbers and pretend they re real.The Democrats and their supporters will go on a victim binge: woe is us, Hillary our leader has fallen, we re crippled (differently abled), we need time to regroup, we can t be expected to make a snap judgment, who cares about constitutional rules governing elections, this is really serious, we have to decide what s best for The People and we have to find a way to pay off Bernie Sanders so he stays in hiding and keeps his big mouth shut.I, for one, would like to see Trump vs. Bernie. Socialist vs. Capitalist. They could do three debates on Globalism and its horrendous effects on America, at which point the public would realize they both claim to perceive the gargantuan threat, albeit from different angles.Hillary was the unabashed queen bee of Globalism.At any rate, you can bet that, as we speak, media giants are taking private briefings on how the election season would proceed if she drops out. They re preparing their talking points and tall stories and outright lies. All somehow culminating in a Democrat Party victory this November, come hell or high water. After Congressional leaders begged President Obama to stay on for several months, he reluctantly agreed, saying:  Well, I do have sixty or seventy executive orders drawn up and ready to go, so perhaps I could bring the country a little closer to the future we envision.

23266,Tyranny Of 9/11: The Building Blocks Of The American Police State From A-Z," No one man can terrorize a whole nation unless we are all his accomplices.    Edward R. MurrowJohn W. Whitehead Huffington PostWe ve walked a strange and harrowing road since September 11, 2001, littered with the debris of our once-vaunted liberties.Over the past 15 years, we have gone from a nation that took great pride in being a model of a representative democracy to being a model of how to persuade the citizenry to march in lockstep with a police state.What began with the passage of the USA Patriot Act in October 2001 has snowballed into the eradication of every vital safeguard against government overreach, corruption and abuse.This is not freedom. This is a jail cell. Set against a backdrop of government surveillance, militarized police, SWAT team raids, asset forfeiture, eminent domain, overcriminalization, armed surveillance drones, whole body scanners, stop and frisk searches, roving VIPR raids and the like all of which have been sanctioned by Congress, the White House and the courts our constitutional freedoms have been steadily chipped away at, undermined, eroded, whittled down, and generally discarded.Our losses are mounting with every passing day.Free speech, the right to protest, the right to challenge government wrongdoing, due process, a presumption of innocence, the right to self-defense, accountability and transparency in government, privacy, press, sovereignty, assembly, bodily integrity, representative government: all of these and more have become casualties in the government s war on the American people, a war that has grown more pronounced since 9/11.Since the towers fell on 9/11, the American people have been treated like enemy combatants, to be spied on, tracked, scanned, frisked, searched, subjected to all manner of intrusions, intimidated, invaded, raided, manhandled, censored, silenced, shot at, locked up, and denied due process.In allowing ourselves to be distracted by terror drills, foreign wars, color-coded warnings, underwear bombers and other carefully constructed exercises in propaganda, sleight of hand, and obfuscation, we failed to recognize that the true enemy to freedom was lurking among us all the while.Indeed, the U.S. government now poses a greater threat to our freedoms than any terrorist, extremist or foreign entity ever could. Here s an A-to-Z primer to spell out exactly what government tyranny means post 9/11.A is for the AMERICAN POLICE STATE.B is for our battered BILL OF RIGHTS.C is for CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE, a diabolical governmental scheme to deprive Americans of their liberties, namely, the right to property.D is for DRONES, weaponized, equipped with lasers, tasers and scanning devices, and aimed at  we the people. E is for ELECTRONIC CONCENTRATION CAMP in which all citizens are suspects, their activities monitored and regulated, their movements tracked, their communications spied upon, and their lives, liberties and pursuit of happiness dependent on the government s say-so.F is for FUSION CENTERS, which serve as a clearinghouse for information shared between state, local and federal agencies. These fusion centers can constantly monitor our communications, everything from our internet activity and web searches to text messages, phone calls and emails.G is for GRENADE LAUNCHERS and GLOBAL POLICE. Take small-town police forces, equip them with enough firepower to render any citizen resistance futile, and then enlist them to be part of the United Nations  Strong Cities Network program, and you not only have a standing army that can operate beyond the reach of the Constitution, but one that is part of a global police force.H is for HOLLOW-POINT BULLETS. The government s efforts to militarize and weaponize its agencies and employees is reaching epic proportions, with federal agencies as varied as the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration stockpiling millions of lethal hollow-point bullets.I is for the INTERNET OF THINGS. This  connected  industry propels us closer to a future where police agencies apprehend virtually anyone if the government  thinks  they may commit a crime, driverless cars populate the highways, and a person s biometrics are constantly scanned and used to track their movements, target them for advertising, and keep them under perpetual surveillance.J is for JAILING FOR PROFIT. Having outsourced their inmate population to private prisons run by private corporations, this profit-driven form of mass punishment has given rise to a $70 billion private prison industry that relies on the complicity of state governments to keep their privately run prisons full by jailing large numbers of Americans for inane crimes.K is for KENTUCKY V. KING, a ruling that opens the door to warrantless police raids, leaving Americans with little real protection in the face of all manner of abuses by law enforcement officials.L is for LICENSE PLATE READERS, which enable law enforcement to track the whereabouts of vehicles, and their occupants, all across the country.M is for MAIN CORE, the U.S. government s database of 8 million or more names and information on Americans considered  threats  to the nation who should be rounded up in times of national emergency or under martial law.N is for NO-KNOCK RAIDS. More than 80,000 of these paramilitary raids are carried out every year more than 200 SWAT team raids every day and all in the pursuit of someone merely suspected of a crime, usually possession of some small amount of drugs.O is for OVERCRIMINALIZATION, which has resulted in an uptick in Americans being arrested and jailed for such absurd  violations  as letting their kids play at a park unsupervised, collecting rainwater and snow runoff on their own property, growing vegetables in their yard, and holding Bible studies in their living room.P is for PATHOCRACY and PRECRIME, tyranny at the hands of a psychopathic government. Couple that with the government s burgeoning precrime programs, and anyone seen as opposing the government whether they re Left, Right or somewhere in between becomes a potential extremist.Q is for QUALIFIED IMMUNITY, which allows officers to walk away without paying a dime for their wrongdoing.R is for ROADSIDE STRIP SEARCHES and BLOOD DRAWS. The courts have increasingly erred on the side of giving government officials especially the police vast discretion in carrying out strip searches, blood draws and even anal probes for a broad range of violations, no matter how minor the offense.S is for the SURVEILLANCE STATE. On any given day, the average American going about his daily business will be monitored, surveilled, spied on and tracked in more than 20 different ways, by both government and corporate eyes and ears.T is for TASERS and other nonlethal weapons, which enable police to aggress with the push of a button, making the potential for overblown confrontations over minor incidents that much more likely.U is for UNARMED CITIZENS SHOT BY POLICE. No longer is it unusual to hear about incidents in which police shoot unarmed individuals first and ask questions later, often attributed to a fear for their safety.V is for VIPR SQUADS, which are tasked with carrying out so-called  soft target  security inspections whenever and wherever the government deems appropriate, at random times and places, and without needing the justification of a particular threat.W is for WHOLE-BODY SCANNERS. Using either x-ray radiation or radio waves,scanning devices and government mobile units are being used not only to  see  through your clothes but to spy on you within the privacy of your home.X is for X-KEYSCORE. One of the many spying programs carried out by the NSA that targets every person in the United States who uses a computer or phone.Y is for YOU-NESS. Facial recognition software promises to create a society in which you can be tracked based on your face, mannerisms, social media and  you-ness. Z is for ZERO TOLERANCE, in which young people are increasingly viewed as suspects and treated as criminals by school officials and law enforcement alike, often for engaging in little more than childish behavior. The lesson being taught to our youngest and most impressionable citizens is this: in the American police state, you re either a prisoner (shackled, controlled, monitored, ordered about, limited in what you can do and say, your life not your own) or a prison bureaucrat (politician, police officer, judge, jailer, spy, profiteer, etc.).As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, the reality we must come to terms with is that in the post-9/11 America we live in today, the government does whatever it wants, freedom be damned.The choices before us are straight-forward.We can live in the past, dwell on what freedoms we used to enjoy and shrug helplessly at the destruction of our liberties.We can immerse ourselves in the present, allowing ourselves to be utterly distracted by the glut of entertainment news and ever-changing headlines so that we fail to pay attention to or do anything about the government s ongoing power-grabs.We can hang our hopes on the future, believing against all odds that someone or something whether it be a politician, a movement, or a religious savior will save us from inevitable ruin.Or we can start right away by instituting changes at the local level, holding our government officials accountable to the rule of law, and resurrecting the Constitution, recognizing that if we fail to do so and instead follow our current trajectory, the picture of the future will be closer to what George Orwell likened to  a boot stamping on a human face forever.

23269,OUT IN THE OPEN: ‘9/11’ 15 Years Of A Transparent Lie,"21st Century Wire says One of the most elaborate crimes of the century continues to be whitewashed   SMOKE SCREEN    Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton There are many doorways into the crimes of 9/11. After the attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center, President George W. Bush called for the creation of remote control systems in commercial airliners in the event of an emergency. By design, this technology would grant air traffic controllers, along with other government entities, the ability to control an aircraft   and steer it towards its final intended destination.Based on history, we know that the Flight Management Systems within Boeing models have been capable of assisting the entire flight through its remote autopilot functions since at least 1984, well before Bush s politically motivated calls for remote control flights in the aftermath of 9/11.From the mid-1980 s, the coded software on the plane would send data to ground control stations, accepting any return flight information or auto-land command. In addition to civilian aircraft being flown remotely before it was acknowledged, the U.S. Air Force apparently constructed an F-106 Delta Dart fighter to be controlled remotely on a combat mission in 1959 under the direction of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).There has been an endless dispute over the how of 9/11 and the who, as well as the various methods used to carry out the crimes of that day. There s an even heavier debate over what brought down WTC Building 7 and since then, other 9/11  rabbit holes  have also challenged the nature of the planes said to be involved in both New York and Washington DC.Whether you re curious and bold enough to head down that path is a whole different matter, but the fact remains, the technology to take over a commercial flight existed long before 9/11.Whatever your thoughts are concerning planes on 9/11 it s still worth noting that even the mainstream media admitted at the time that there was, no evidence of a plane at all,  following the destruction of a portion of the Pentagon s western side.Indeed, 15 years on, there are still many more question than there are plausible answers.More from Paul Craig Roberts below   Einst rzende Neubauten    A single day has shaped the modern world. (Image Source: downtownexpress)9/11: 15 Years Of A Transparent LiePaul Craig RobertsThere are many conspiracy theories about 9/11. The US government s own explanation of 9/11 is a conspiracy theory in which a few Saudi Arabians outwitted the American national security state. Little doubt that many of the more imaginative conspiracy theories were created for the purpose of stigmatizing any skepticism, no matter how well reasoned and supported, of the official story.When thinking about 9/11, it is important to differentiate expert opinion from improbable explanations.Among the expert opinion are 2,600 structural engineers and high-rise architects who comprise Architects & Engineers for 9/11 truth and have written to Congress asking for a real investigation, Firefighters for 9/11 truth, Pilots for 9/11 truth, physicists and chemists who analyzed the dust from the twin towers and report finding reacted and unreacted materials used in controlled demolitions, and former government officials who understand that a security failure as great as 9/11 would have produced an immediate and exacting investigation.These groups of qualified and experienced people say that the official story of 9/11 is false.  Architects, engineers, and scientists say that the official story is physically impossible. Firefighters and WTC maintenance personnel say that there were numerous explosions within the towers and that the first explosions were in the sub-basements prior to the buildings being hit by airplanes. Experienced military and civilian pilots say the maneuvers of the aircraft are beyond the capability of the alleged hijackers. Both co-chairman of the 9/11 Commission and the legal counsel have written books in which they have said that information was withheld from the Commission, that the US government lied to the Commission, and that the Commission was set up to failIn other words, the hard evidence simply does not support the official story.We know that the official story is false. We don t know who is responsible or the purpose the event was intended to serve. However, circumstantial evidence strongly supports suspicion of the neoconservatives whose high positions in the government would have enabled them to succeed with a false flag attack and to delay and divert any investigation until the official story was set in stone. We also know from the  dancing Israelis  that elements in the Israeli government had advance notice of the attack as Israeli agents were set up ready to film the destruction of the twin towers.More from Paul Craig Roberts here READ MORE 9/11 NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 9/11 Files",Middle-east,"September 10, 2016"
23270,"SYRIA CEASEFIRE? Lavrov, Kerry Agree to Fight Al-Nusra, No Strikes on ‘Rebels,’ Aleppo Relief","21st Century Wire says After a long drawn out round of bilateral peace talks in Geneva Switzerland this week, Russia and the United States announced a plan for a 48 hour ceasefire in Syria, scheduled to take effect at sundown Monday.Incredibly, the cornerstone of this agreement rests on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State John Kerry, both agreeing (for now anyway) that they would both be targeting the terrorist  opposition  force, Al Nusra Front (al Qaeda in Syria, supported covertly by both the Saudi Arabia and the US/CIA) who recently  rebranded  themselves to  Jabhat Fateh Al-Sham  in cynical desperate move to avoid being targeted by military airstrikes.Back in May, when another ceasefire was proposed, 21WIRE warned that it was only a ploy by the US to buy more time for  rebels  to re-arm and repair broken rat lines from Turkey into northern Syria. That turned out to be 100% correct, despite the fact the western media outlets were duped by Washington s desperate diplomatic ploy   reinforced by a multi-million dollar, New York City-based PR campaign targeting social media and funded by George Soros and others, which was marketed using the tagline #AleppoIsBurning.Are we seeing more of the same this week in Geneva?For a comprehensive analysis on what this latest temporary ceasefire agree really means, and where it could be heading, watch his excellent segment featuring political analyst Ammar Waqqaf. Watch: According to Kerry, the plan is to ensure that Syrian government forces will not carry out combat missions where the so-called moderate opposition is present.Speaking of fight against Al-Nusra and its efforts to blend with moderate rebels, Kerry stressed  going on Al-Nusra is not a concession to anybody  but  is profoundly in the interests of the US. 'Going on Al-Nusra is profoundly in the interests of the US'   #Kerry https://t.co/1MeCyNAvE5 #LavrovKerry #Syria pic.twitter.com/fjvctBZJFa  RT (@RT_com) September 9, 2016Kerry also outlined an establishment of the Russian-US Joint Implementation Centre (JIG) that would serve the purpose of delineation of territories controlled by Al-Nusra and opposition groups in the area of active hostilities. Taking the floor, the Russian FM confirmed that Russia and US had agreed to coordinate airstrikes in Syria,  provided there is a sustained period of reduced violence. The first step toward the implementation of this clause will be a 48-hour ceasefire in Syria, Lavrov said.Lavrov elaborated that the ceasefire comes into effect on September 12 and should last for at least seven days.( ) Despite the mistrust and attempt to disrupt what we have agreed upon, we managed to work out a package of documents, there are five of them. It allows us to set an effective coordination in the fight against terrorism, to expand the humanitarian access to distressed population, first and foremost in Aleppo,  Lavrov said.Due to the sensitive nature of the information contained in the agreements, they will not be made available to general public, Lavrov said. We cannot make these documents public. They contain rather serious, sensitive information. We don t want it to fall into hands of those who would surely try to disrupt the implementation of the measures stipulated within in the framework of humanitarian delivery supplies and in other parts of our agreements.

23271,"BUSH-HINCKLEY NEXUS: Reagan Gunman Released, Reviving Conspiracy Suspicions","Shawn Helton 21st Century WireOn the eve of the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 Attacks, the man implicated in shooting the 40th President of the United States will be released from captivity after 35 years.The attempted assassination of US President Ronald Reagan is one of the most infamous crimes of the 20th century. Like the assassination of JFK, it was an act that will forever be shrouded in conspiracy, intrigue and mystery.  CALCULATED CRIME    Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn HeltonAlthough it s been over three decades since John Hinckley Jr. reportedly shot Reagan and three others at the Washington Hilton Hotel in the spring of 1981, many questions regarding the traumatic event continue to persist to this day.The importance of this dramatic incident should be emphasized, as it revealed a rather uncanny family connection between the Bush family and the Hinckley family, highlighted by a series of strange circumstances prior to the shooting itself, as well as a crime scene that was largely left unexplained   A DARK DAY    According to analysts and researchers such as John Judge, Reagan had already been struck under his left arm after raising his left arm to the crowd outside the Hilton Hotel. Image Source: (lawabsolute) The Reagan Shooting Prior to being shot outside the Washington Hilton Hotel on March 30th, 1981, Reagan had been giving a speech to the Building and Construction Trades Department of the AFL-CIO. During that builders speech, Reagan outlined a budget cut plan that received a restrained response from those concerned over union jobs according to reports. Contrary to most mainstream reports about the incident, Reagan s exit on the south side of the Hilton on Florida Avenue following his speech, as we ll find out later, was anything but routine.According to the official story, Hinckley is stated to have crouched and fired a .22 caliber R hm RG-14 revolver during a rainy afternoon in the nation s capital.Reagan, his press secretary, James S. Brady, Secret Service agent Timothy J. McCarthy and District of Columbia policeman Thomas K. Delahaney, had all been shot in a sea of reporters, Secret Service members, police and plain clothes police, as well as unknown spectators at the location according to NBC cameraman Shelly Fieldman, one of those who filmed the chaotic ambush as it happened.The assassination attempt occurred just 69 days into the Reagan presidency and the apparent motive seemed born out of a Hollywood studio back lot, as Hinckley was supposedly trying to impress actress Jodie Foster by reenacting would-be-assassin Arthur Bremer s assassination attempt on then Presidential candidate, George Wallace, which in turn was fictionalized for Martin Scorsese s motion picture Taxi Driver, a film that co-starred Foster. Evidence of a note to Foster is said to have materialized out of Hinckley s room at the Washington Hilton Hotel following the shooting.  PLANTED STORY?    An all to familiar Hollywood narrative grafted onto a crime   was Hinckley inspired by an actress and a film? (Image Source: upi)Incidentally, in 1992, George Wallace Jr. asserted that President Richard Nixon s campaign had prior knowledge of Bremer s whereabouts before the shooting of his father, something which prompted the family to call for a new investigation. The complaint emerged after an article appeared in New Yorker magazine stating that Nixon and one of his aides had talked about planting George McGovern s campaign literature in Bremer s apartment.According to other reports,  The plan had to be dropped because the F.B.I. quickly sealed the apartment, according to the article. George Wallace s top aide Elvin Stanton, was later on record stating that government insiders may have been involved in a conspiracy to take Wallace out of the 1972 Presidential race. So was there a larger conspiracy behind the attempt on Reagan s life?  STAY-BEHIND - Vice President George Bush seen here with Rita Clements first lady of Texas Governor Bill Clements, Texas Secretary of State George Strake and Dallas Congressman Jim Collins on an Austin tarmac waiting on Reagan s prognosis. (Image Source: dallasnews)Absent from the shocking scene at the Hilton, was Vice President George H.W. Bush, who had traveled to Fort Worth to dedicate a historical plaque at the Fort Worth Hyatt Regency. After news of the failed assassination on Reagan, he continued travelling to Austin to speak at the Tarrant County Convention Center   to talk with the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association. Some researchers have stated that Bush was waiting on the tarmac in Austin not only to learn of Reagan s prognosis, but to possibly be sworn in as Reagan s successor, if the commander-in-chief did not survive the shooting.Incidentally, the Fort Worth Hyatt Regency where Bush had been on March 30th, was once known as Hotel Texas, the same hotel that President John F. Kennedy stayed at On November 21, 1963   one day before being assassinated in Dealey Plaza.On March 24th, at the behest of National Security Adviser Richard Allen who was in command of the Situation Room, Reagan appointed Bush as the head of his  crisis management  team less than a week before the attempt on his life. Allen s National Security Council team was tapped to provide support for Bush s crisis squad.Amid a contentious atmosphere between  Bush loyalists  and Reagan loyalists  at the White House, Secretary of State Alexander Haig famously declared,  I am in control here. This prompted some to suggest that the move was an erroneous PR faux pas and at worst a grab for power while Reagan was being treated for injuries at the hospital. Others have suggested that Haig, was merely protecting the Reagan-led White House until an investigation into all elements of the shooting could be completed. Additionally, some also believed his comments may have been taken out of context in relation to an actual succession of the presidency.According to the author Dr. Peter Knight, Haig, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and others were aware of an apparent North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) exercise set to take place on March 31st, 1981,   the very next day after the shooting. However, due to concern about the  timing  of the NORAD operation, amid the turbulent political wake of the Reagan shooting, the White House supposedly canceled it.Some five hours later after the shooting Vice President Bush arrived in Washington. While there should have been a lengthy investigation given the nature of the crime itself, the shooting was ruled an isolated incident, without conspiracy, according to the newly tapped leader of the White House crisis management team.  RAWHIDE S EXIT    The Secret Service code name used for Reagan was Rawhide. Though it was reported that agents maintained a diamond-shaped security formation surrounding Reagan, some suggest the group s alignment went askew as the President walked out in the open towards the limousine which was parked away from the exit.  (Image Source: pbs.org)On the morning of March 30th, Reagan had apparently been advised that wearing a protective vest was not necessary because there would be minimal  public exposure  after his speech from the hotel and to the limousine and that there were no credible threats for safety that day.Reportedly, after being hit Reagan had been delayed on the way to the hospital and apparently according to well-known researcher John Judge, he was slated to be brought to Bethesda Medical Center but allegedly due to the coloration of his face and the blood he d been coughing up, he was transported to the much closer George Washington University Hospital   though Brady was said to have arrived several minutes before Reagan.Interestingly, even though initial reports stated Reagan  was never in any serious danger,  nothing could have been further from the truth, as Reagan reportedly lost  3,400 cubic centimeters of blood,  or about 3.7 quarts, there are 5 or 6 quarts held in an average body.According Dennis S. O Leary, dean of clinical affairs at GWU Hospital Reagan had a  relatively simple procedure,  receiving a fresh frozen plasma transfusion. Dr. Frank C. Spencer, chief surgeon at New York University Medical Center, was quoted as stating the following when asked about Reagan s health,  Why would you give that amount of blood if he was not in a life-threatening situation and the patient s life was no in serious danger? Additionally, some have asserted that the cold blood or frozen plasma used to save Reagan, could have potentially caused other health problems for the President.On another note, Secret Service agent Joe Trainor, who was tasked with gathering evidence at the hospital after the shooting, oddly stated that Reagan s wound, was no bigger than a paper cut,  and a thin dime-sized fragment was given to the FBI for processing.Here NBC cameraman Fieldman is interviewed by host and journalist John Chancellor on NBC Nightly News, discussing details of the incident. Notice that one of the still images appears to depict a bullet hole in the back of the limousine Unexplained ForensicsAll of shooter Hinckley s bullets could be accounted for according to the FBI, and gunman had deadly accuracy, supposedly landing out 4-6 shots on those at the scene, if you are to believe the official story.John Judge explained the following concerning the various pathways concerning Hinckley s apparent  Devastator  bullets, primarily used by air marshals to thwart hijackers in the 1970 s: Hinckley had six bullets in the gun. One hit Delahanty, a cop, and threw him to the ground by nicking, grazing his shoulder and neck. Another one into the groin of Agent McCarthy, a 160 pound man, it lifted him up and threw him back to the other end of the limousine. Another bullet, the initial bullet fired by Hinckley, hit Mr. Brady in the head, knocked him to the ground and did considerable brain damage. One bullet nicked the windshield of the limousine. One bullet went into the Universal office building across the street and one bullet went into the trunk of the car and you can see when you look at photos closely very clear hole, and not a ricochet or a scar mark but a hole going into the car penetrating the outer metal wall. The bullet that hit Reagan hit him by all accounts at an early point. Judge concluded, as others have contended, there was a second shooter at the Hilton Hotel located in the  Bushy Knoll  (a term Judge coined), as the limo waiting for Reagan was some 40ft down the curb. Reagan was allegedly shot, as Judge stated,  [with] a very specific weapon developed by the intelligence agencies which is a CO2 propelled fleshet.  This would account for the thin slit reported by Secret Service and others.Here s a description of the Devastator or exploding bullet from the National Center for Biotechnology Information: It should also be noted that individuals can easily obtain instructions for the creation of their own bullets. The most infamous use of such bullets was the attempted assassination of President Reagan in 1981 by John Hinckley, who used  Devastator  bullets (Bingham Limited, USA) composed of a lacquer sealed aluminium tip with a lead azide centre designed to explode on impact. Although frequently referred to in works of fiction, they are rarely encountered in forensic practice, because sales have been restricted following the incident in 1981.   POSING WITH GUNS    Several images surfaced during Hinckley s trial depicting heavy-handed symbolism for dramatic effect. (Image Source: nydailynews)Releasing Hinckley?Though Hinckley would later be declared not guilty by reason of insanity, he was ordered to have ongoing treatment as a forensic patient at St. Elizabeth s hospital located in the southeast quadrant of the nation s capital.Flash forward more than three decades Over this past summer, it was reported that the 61-year-old Hinckley would be released from St. Elizabeth s maximum security mental hospital. Here s a passage from a mainstream media report that discusses the latest developments in the case and the court s reason for release: Judge Paul L. Friedman of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia wrote in his opinion that Mr. Hinckley, 61, no longer posed a danger to himself or others. The report continued adding that,  Since 2014, Judge Friedman has allowed Mr. Hinckley to have 17-day stays in Williamsburg, where he has voluntary jobs doing landscaping at a Unitarian church and working in the library and cafeteria of a psychiatric hospital. Interestingly, Judge Friedman has banned Hinckley from corresponding with news media and has allowed the infamous shooter access to drive a 30-mile radius from Williamsburg  unaccompanied  in addition his ability to drive to monthly hospital appointments in the Washington DC area.Whether you believe the official story of the Reagan shooting or not, it is unconscionable to think that a person reportedly responsible for shooting a president, along with other law enforcement agents and a White House cabinet member, could see the light of day after such a high-profile crime.Hinckley s release will only serve to highlight the bizarre series events associated with the attempt on Reagan s life, which many believe has been covered up to this day.  ASSASSIN S CREED    Hinckley seen posing in front of Ford s Theater, the site of Abraham Lincoln s assassination. (Image Source: rawhidedown)Bush-Hinckley Family TiesThe Houston Post reported, the Hinckley s reportedly made large contributions to Vice President Bush s political campaign.According to the former dean of the University of Montana School of Journalism Nathaniel Blumberg the events of March 30th, were far from uncovered.The following is a passage from his book  THE AFTERNOON OF MARCH 30: A Contemporary Historical Novel, where Blumberg discussed the Bush-Hinckley connection made by NBC s John Chancellor: John Chancellor, eyebrows raised, informed the viewers of NBC Nightly News that the brother of the man who tried to kill the president was acquainted with the son of the man who would have become president if the attack had been successful. As a matter of fact, Chancellor said in a bewildered tone, Scott Hinckley [brother of John Hinckley Jr] and Neil Bush [brother of George W. Bush] had been scheduled to have dinner together at the home of the vice president s son the very next night. According to the Missoulian, Blumberg called it a contemporary historical novel, and it centered on his belief that Neil Bush   son of President George H.W. Bush   and his wife Sharon were co-conspirators in John Hinckley s attempt to assassinate President Ronald Reagan in 1981. On March 9th, 1985, in an article entitled  New novel questions probe of Reagan shooting,  published by UPI, Blumberg s self-published novel,  The Afternoon of March 30th,  also discussed the following: The Hinckley oil company was warned, just hours before the shooting, that it faced a $2-million fine for overpricing oil. The possible charges were never mentioned after Hinckley s attempt.  The widely accepted official story that Hinckley was trying to get the attention of actress Jodie Foster was based entirely on a letter that Hinckley was said to have written, but which the public and the media never saw. Additionally, Scott Hinckley was a Vice President for John Hinckley Sr. s Vanderbilt Energy and was reportedly friends with Neil Bush who had been working for AMOCO, in Denver. The Bush s Zapata Oil was said to have  bailed out  Vanderbilt Energy some time during the 1960 s.Other interesting connections concerning Hinckley were made by the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal: The club records, mementos, and clippings that normally mark a student s passage through a university are nonexistent in the case of Hinckley. Official university transcripts and records were taken by Texas Tech administrators almost by the time President Reagan and the other victims reached a hospital Monday. Continuing, the journal outlined another curious connection in the Bush-Hinckley nexus: Jim Francis, operations manager of the Dallas oil firm Brighton Co., and a fundraiser for Gov. Bill Clements, was Hinckley s basketball coach in the fourth through sixth grades. In 1974, the Hinckley s moved from Texas to Evergreen, Colorado, while John Jr. reportedly stayed behind. However, prior to the Reagan shooting, Hinckley s primary home was listed in Evergreen.Other investigators have gone even further by citing the work of John Judge   in support of a clear case for George H W Bush as the assassin of President Ronald Reagan.Hinckley was said to have had no criminal record before being arrested previously in Nashville, Tennessee   by Metropolitan Airport Police in Nashville on Oct. 9, 1980, for carrying firearms. That same day, then President Jimmy Carter, was holding a town hall meeting at the Grand Ole Opry, while Reagan reportedly cancelled a stop in Memphis during that time frame.The guns confiscated at the time included a .38 and two .22-caliber pistols according to officials. Although the Hinckley s issued a statement about their son s mental health issues following the Reagan shooting, Nashville authorities could not find any information related to him being mentally ill in the past.Below is a montage of several clips discussing Hinckley s background and his family s relationship to the Bush family   ABC s Charles Murphy discusses mysterious phone calls that Hinckley received each day at a phone booth while staying at a motel in Denver A touch of irony, the young man walking with the elder Hinckley is 30-year-old Scott Hinckley, John Jr. s brother, he and Vice President Bush s son Neil, are friends, they had planned to have dinner together in Denver tonight   the plans have been cancelled   Stephen Geer ABC News   SHOCK & AWE    During Reagan s campaign he often criticized Bush for being linked to the globalist designs of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission. (Image Source: pinterest)A Shooter s Odyssey: Lone Gunman & Parallel PlotsAs 21WIRE has covered in recent years, very often there is much more involved behind-the-scenes when it comes to sensationalized shootings in America, particularly of those said to be  lone wolf , or lone gunman events. The incidents themselves are quickly taken out of the political and forensic realm, giving way to a hyper-realized account, often defying logic and reason. Though simple elements of a shooting may defy explanation, authority actors will rapidly emerge with emotionally charged narratives along with some evidence; the grafting of parallel motives viewed in other crimes, the stacking of circumstantial evidence, a ready-made  manifesto  or gripping photographic imagery used to direct perception.The Hinckley case, like other more modern mass shootings and the shootings of JFK, RFK and MLK (as well as John Lennon who was killed by Mark Chapman who worked for the Hinckley linked organization World Vision), was certainly no exception.Below, researcher and writer John Judge takes through the winding conspiracy surrounding the attempt on Reagan s life. Watch carefully, as he pieces together one of the most enigmatic crimes of the 20th century Here s a news compilation of the reportage concerning the Reagan assassination attempt In SummaryOverlapping political narratives often dovetail a crisis, staged or otherwise, and the shooting of Reagan (as with other events) was no different, as tension was building in Europe there were critical new developments abroad and according to the CIA,  [ by] mid-November 1981, Haig sent President Reagan a memorandum outlining the implications of what he described as a  peaceful revolution  underway in Poland under the leadership of Solidarity, the national trade union. Interestingly, Haig, who was believed to have protected the Reagan Administration during the March 30th shooting, saw the situation change, as the so-called peaceful revolution ended abruptly in December when the Polish regime imposed martial law throughout the country to challenge the movement. However, that event in Poland is accepted by most historians as one catalyst which eventually led to an end to the Iron Curtain, and then the Soviet Union.In a world full of foreign policy game changers, sudden shifts in international narratives may contain valuable clues to solving some of history s most perplexing events.

23273,"WMD FRAUD: Sexed-up UN ‘Chemical Weapons’ Report on Syria Contrived to Trigger More Sanctions, Intervention","21st Century Wire says When the UN  released its summary of their  chemical weapons  report on August 30th, the usual suspects   led by the US, UK and France, immediately rushed to their media pulpits to claim that this was  proof  that Syria, under the leadership of President Bashar al Assad, was somehow guilty (again) of the charge of  using chlorine bombs against its own people.  This latest UN report was the result of a year-long joint inquiry with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Before the full report was even released, western officials and their media surrogates began hysterically claiming that it was imperative for the UN Security Council to move for more sanctions against Syria, to impose a  Safe Zone  (No-Fly Zone) and to possibly give more license to increasing US-led military intervention in Syria. When confronted with the summary of the yet-to-be released report, Russian Ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, came straight out of the gates, stating it was wrong to jump to conclusions before actually reading the report, replying simply,  There are a number of questions which have to be clarified before we accept all the findings of the report. Russian Ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin.This week the full report was finally released, and as it turns out   Russia s Churkin was 100% correct. The report, as with many other US-led attempts to fabricate cases of weapons of mass destruction against governments it wishes to depose, seems at the very least to be sexed-up, and at most   a completely fraudulent assessment of events on the ground in Syria. The only real conclusive findings in this report point to ISIS using sulfur mustard gas in Syria. Once again, the West, led by the United States, has attempted to position what appears to be another fabricated case against the Syrian government   and place that in the same report next to real findings of a malicious ISIS chemical weapons attack   in a somewhat crude attempt to conflate the two (ISIS and Assad) in the court of public opinion.Even worse than attempting to falsely attribute chemical weapons attacks to Syria and Assad, the UN is also guilty of ignoring witness testimonies that have said  chlorine attacks  were in fact staged by western-backed  rebels  (see details and assessment of the UN report below). POWELL & POWER: Same  WMD  fraud, different target nation. You could tell that a desperate agenda was in play judging by the over-the-top and leading statements made by US, UK and French representatives before the report was released two weeks ago.Of course, leading the charge, with a her summary of the yet-to-be released fraudulent assessment in hand, was R2P hawk and US Ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, who insisted that Syria must  pay a price . She added, It is incumbent on the council to act swiftly to show that when we put that Joint Investigative Mechanism in place we were serious about there being meaningful accountability. Once again, just like Colin Powell before her, and as with Iraq  the west brazenly touts another dodgy dossier, custom-made for yet another humanitarian stitch-up. British UN Ambassador Matthew Rycroft also joined-in the diplomatic pantomime, saying the UK is calling for the imposition of a sanctions regime and some form of accountability within international legal mechanisms. French UN Ambassador Francois Delattre demanded a  quick and strong security council response  and said,  We need a resolution with teeth.  Back in August 2013, Western and Saudi-backed  rebels  launched an elaborate media-driven  WMD  hoax also designed to assign blame to the Syrian Government for  sarin gas  attacks in East Ghouta, Damascus. Western newspapers ran photos of Assad with headlines like,  Now They re Gassing Their Own Children (image, above). On the back of that stunt, both the US and the UK even went so far as to press for a declaration of war vote in both their parliaments. Unfortunately for their military industrial complexes, the public did not buy it, but that hasn t discouraged them to keep on trying.What s more shocking however, is why the United Nations would allow its name to be attributed to such a fraudulent and misleading document   one that is clearly designed to bolster another bogus case for western military intervention. In the end, this type of self-interested abuse and manipulation by certain UN Security Council members only serves to damage the credibility of the UN as an international arbiter and the institution as a whole (maybe that s part of the West s agenda too).Verdict: The  evidence  presented in the UN report derives hearsay reporting only from  activists  and  rebels (listed terrorist groups), in effect, lowering the bar so that absolutely no burden of proof is required by accusing parties.Considering what is at stake, and knowing full-well just how the US, UK, France and its NATO allies have demonstrated they are willing to conjure any report of  chemical attacks by the regime  and will hold this up as a violation of Barack Obama and Washington s ethereal Red Line    this is leads immediately to calls to mount another  humanitarian  intervention.Joining in the party also, are the West s new instruments of war: high-profile  human rights  charities with links the US State Department. One such organization, Human Rights Watch, whose CEO Ken Roth has already been seen on multiple occasions tweeting fake Syria images in order to build the case for  regime change ,  called on the UN Security council to renew its resolution referring Syria to the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Louis Charbonneau, UN director at Human Rights Watch stated, Russia and China don t have a leg to stand on by continuing to obstruct the Security Council,  he said,  The Security Council diminishes its importance if it doesn t take strong action against demonstrated use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government.  To learn more about  Human Rights  NGOs are being used to support western imperial objectives read 21WIRE s detailed report on this subject:AN INTRODUCTION: SMART POWER & THE HUMAN RIGHTS INDUSTRIAL COMPLEXMore on the Washington s latest dodgy dossier from award-winning journalist Robert Parry Robert Parry  Consortium NewsUnited Nations investigators encountered evidence that alleged chemical weapons attacks by the Syrian military were staged by jihadist rebels and their supporters, but still decided to blame the government for two incidents in which chlorine was allegedly dispersed via improvised explosives dropped by helicopters.In both cases, the Syrian government denied that it had any aircraft in the areas at the times of the purported attacks, but the U.N. team rejected that explanation with the curious argument that Syria failed to provide flight records to corroborate the absence of any flights. Yet, if there had been no flights, there would be no flight records.The U.N. team also dismissed out of hand the possibility that jihadist rebels who had overrun some air bases and thus had operational helicopters at their disposal might have used them as part of a staged event designed to incriminate the Damascus regime and thus justify U.S. or other outside military intervention.Another problem with the U.N. team s findings is that the home-made chlorine bombs had minimal military value, inflicting relatively few casualties and only a handful of deaths.Why the Syrian government, which was under intense international pressure regarding alleged chemical weapons use and was in the process of surrendering its stockpile of such weapons, would have jerry-rigged a handful of homemade bombs and dropped them for no discernible military effect makes little sense.However, since Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has been thoroughly demonized over his harsh reaction to an uprising that began in 2011, pretty much any accusation against him   no matter how unlikely or implausible   is widely accepted in the mainstream Western media and political circles. In other words, the U.N. team was under pressure to reach a guilty verdict.Accusations of StagingYet, the evidence from at least one of the incidents examined by the U.N. team suggests that an attack on Al-Tamanah on the night of April 29-30, 2014, might well have been staged by rebels and then played up by activists through social media. Seven witnesses stated that frequent alerts [about an imminent chlorine weapons attack by the government] had been issued, but in fact no incidents with chemicals took place,  the U.N. report stated.  While people sought safety after the warnings, their homes were looted and rumours spread that the events were being staged.   [T]hey [these witnesses] had come forward to contest the wide-spread false media reports. Accounts from other people, who did allege that there had been a government chemical attack on Al-Tamanah, provided suspect evidence, including data from questionable sources, according to the U.N. report.The report said,  Three witnesses, who did not give any description of the incident on 29-30 April 2014, provided material of unknown source. One witness had second-hand knowledge of two of the five incidents in Al-Tamanah, but did not remember the exact dates. Later that witness provided a USB-stick with information of unknown origin, which was saved in separate folders according to the dates of all the five incidents mentioned by the FFM (the U.N. s Fact-Finding Mission). Another witness provided the dates of all five incidents reading it from a piece of paper, but did not provide any testimony on the incident on 29-30 April 2014. The latter also provided a video titled  site where second barrel containing toxic chlorine gas was dropped tamanaa 30 April 14 Some other witnesses alleging a Syrian government attack offered curious claims about detecting the chlorine-infused  barrel bombs  based on how the device sounded in its descent.The U.N. report said,  The eyewitness, who stated to have been on the roof, said to have heard a helicopter and the  very loud  sound of a falling barrel. Some interviewees had referred to a distinct whistling sound of barrels that contain chlorine as they fall. The witness statement could not be corroborated with any further information. As in other cases that were investigated, the U.N. team demanded that the Syrian government provide flight records to support its denial that any of its aircraft were in the air in that vicinity at the time of the attack. The Government of the Syrian Arab Republic stated that no military activities were conducted from land or air in Al-Tamanah on the dates of the incidents, but did not provide any records of flight operations to support this statement,  the U.N. report said.In the Al-Tamanah case, the U.N. team judged the evidence insufficient to reach a firm judgment regarding who was responsible. However, in two other cases, in Talmenes in April 2014 and Sarmin in March 2015, the U.N. team accused the Syrian military of dropping chlorine-infused  barrel bombs. Investigative LimitationsYet, regarding all eight cases that were examined, the U.N. team acknowledged significant limitations on its ability to investigate.The report said,  As was the case with the Fact-Finding missions, the lack of access to the locations under investigation due to the dire security situation on the ground affected the manner in which the Mechanism [a committee from the U.N. and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons] was able to conduct its investigation. Visits to certain locations would have facilitated the ability of the Mechanism to (a) confirm and access specific locations of interest; (b) collect comparative environmental samples; (c) identify new witnesses; and (d) physically evaluate the material of interest to the Mechanism (e.g., remnants). Other challenges and constraints include the following factors: (a) the time period that had elapsed since the incident (i.e. in some cases, more than two years since the incident); (b) the lack of chain of custody for some of the material received; (c) the source of information and material was of secondary or tertiary nature; (d) some of the information material, including those depicting the size and nature of the incident, were misleading; (e) finding independent sources of information that could provide access to individuals and information material proved difficult; and (f) the impact locations were not preserved and were compromised by the time they were recorded (e.g., the videos and photographs of the impact locations were taken days after the incident and in many cases after the remnants had been removed from the impact location). In other words, the U.N./OPCW investigation was compromised by its inability to conduct an effective on-the-ground assessment and was forced to rely on witnesses who were often allied with the rebel forces or sympathetic to the political opposition to President Assad.This problem is reminiscent of what happened inside the U.S. Intelligence Community in the run-up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq when some 18 witnesses   supposedly  defectors  from Saddam Hussein s regime   became  walk-ins  who presented claims about the Iraqi government s supposed weapons of mass destruction.CIA analysts debunked some of these bogus claims and traced some of the deceit to the machinations of the pro-invasion Iraqi National Congress (INC), but   given the political-and-media hatred of Saddam Hussein   the CIA analysts were under intense pressure to accept some of the dubious accounts that were then incorporated into U.S. intelligence products and used to justify a war under false pretenses.As with Iraq   where the U.S. government had helped fund anti-regime groups such as the INC   a similar situation exists inside Syria where U.S. officials have assisted the  opposition  in organizing politically and mastering propaganda skills. So, the means and opportunity for depicting regime  atrocities  through social media are there, along with the motive.These activists   as well as the radical jihadists and other armed rebels   have become increasingly desperate to induce the United States to intervene militarily against the Syrian army and thus make their desired  regime change  possible. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Aug. 30, 2013, claims to have proof that the Syrian government was responsible for a chemical weapons attack on Aug. 21, 2013, but that evidence failed to materialize or was later discredited. [State Department photo]Obama s Red LineThe emphasis on creating a chemical weapons casus belli increased when President Barack Obama set the Syrian government s possible use of such weapons as a  red line  that might cause him to intervene directly with U.S. forces.That comment and the political pressure for instituting another Mideast  regime change  were the backdrop for the sarin gas attack outside Damascus on Aug. 21, 2013, which anti-Assad activists, the mainstream U.S. press, and the U.S. State Department immediately blamed on government forces.In the ensuing days, Obama came to the edge of authorizing a retaliatory military strike before hearing from U.S. and other Western intelligence services that they had doubts about who had actually pulled off the attack.Since then, the sarin case against Assad has largely collapsed (although to defuse the crisis he agreed to a Russian plan for Syria to surrender all its chemical weapons). The evidence now appears to indicate that radical jihadists released the sarin with the goal of goading Obama into joining the war on their side, i.e., a false-flag operation.As the sarin case fell apart in 2014, the U.S. government shifted its emphasis toward chlorine-gas allegations. I first encountered this bait-and-switch tactic when I pressed a senior State Department official to back up or back off the increasingly discredited sarin gas claims.While sidestepping the sarin case, the official asserted that the Syrian government almost surely was responsible for the more recent chlorine-gas incidents, citing the bombs  delivery by helicopter and arguing that only the Syrian government possessed such aircraft.According to the U.N. report, however, that belief regarding the government s monopoly of helicopters may not be true, since rebel forces had captured air bases where operational helicopters were present. That means, at least theoretically, the jihadists could have staged the night-time attacks   complete with prior alarms spread by activist first-responders, known as  white helmets,  about the imminent arrival of  government  helicopters with chlorine bombs.But the more nettlesome question, which the U.N. report does not address, is why would the Syrian government launch these strange attacks while realizing that any chemical weapons incident could prompt U.S. military intervention that could tip the war in favor of the jihadists and other rebels, especially since the chlorine attacks had virtually no military value.Few FatalitiesWhile the makeshift chlorine bombs may have sent scores of civilians to get medical attention, very few of the casualties were fatal, according to the U.N. report. By contrast, the Aug. 21, 2013 sarin attack killed hundreds, with the U.S. government putting out an even higher (and almost surely exaggerated) number of 1,429 dead Continue this report at Consortium NewsREAD MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Syria Files",Middle-east,"September 9, 2016"

23275,"False Alarm or Psy-Op? LAX ‘Active Shooter’ Spectacle, JFK Airport Panic & Staged Propaganda","Shawn Helton 21st Century WireAnother active-shooter  false alarm  made the headlines this past week, as war propaganda images continue be dispensed by Western media   multiple narratives that have contributed to an environment of confusion, fear and uncertainty in the War On Terror era.The timing of these current events cannot be overstated, revealing a deeper social engineering agenda at play underneath the larger geopolitical drama unfolding worldwide   PULP FICTION    Photo illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton The Nonexistent Shooter &  Loud Noises This past weekend, according reports, another  active shooter  scenario played out at LAX International Airport, a story which dovetailed an alleged active-shooter hoax at JFK International Airport earlier in August. CBS s Los Angeles affiliate CBSLA, described the latest incident at LAX in the following passage: The LAX Airport Police Department on Sunday discounted reports of a shooter at the airport saying loud noises apparently set off a panic. Several terminals were evacuated. Many people went on social media to say they were standing on the tarmac surrounded by tons of police.The incident was first reported just after 8:30 p.m.The LA Airport PD cannot confirm an active shooter was ever identified. The CBS article continued by discussing eyewitness accounts of the alleged active shooter event at LAX, as well as JFK airport, two incidents which oddly resulted in the same bizarre conclusion out of law enforcement   as the panic was supposedly caused by loud noise: Earlier this month, JFK officials said an elaborate hoax was perpetuated there, as well. Reports of a shooter at JFK were discounted as bogus, according to the New York Times.KCAL9 Anchor Leyna Nguyen was at the airport returning to Los Angeles from Atlanta. She said it was  surreal  to see so many people running.LAFD is also on scene investigating and noted  no significant incident has been noted thus far  as of 8:47 p.m.At of 9:40 p.m., police officially said there was no shooter and no incident. It will still take some time to re-screen all the passengers, officials said. Interestingly, even though individual accounts of this week s LAX event varied, a Yahoo News reporter named JP Mangalindan, stated that he was in the terminal at the time of the shooting. However, following the panic inducing incident, he posted to social media with the following message, after police had already confirmed there was  no shooter  two hours earlier: Shooters at LAX running around. Cops running around. I m down on the ground,  at 11:51pm.Question: Why would Mangalindan state that multiple shooter s were  running around  at 11:51pm when cops disclosed that the situation was basically a non-incident by 9:40pm?It s possible that Mangalindan was confused during the heat of the moment but however you look at it, his messages may have caused additional panic, potentially creating a greater risk for passengers fleeing the airport to safety.Here s a string of tweets confirming Mangalindan continued to heighten the situation from inside LAX Eventually Mangalindan conceded that the event was in fact a false alarm (was this a potential drill?) at 1:08am, according to the Daily Mail  as he readied himself for a future pizza delivery.As this story rapidly unfolded, there proved to be other bizarre aspects associated with the official narrative, as a man dressed as the fictional character Zorro (armed with a plastic sword), was initially apprehended in dramatic fashion following the reported active shooter scenario at LAX. He was then promptly released by authorities after the strange incident.  ZORRO?    An unidentified actor dressed as Zorro was an initial suspect during an active-shooter alarm at LAX. (Image Source: Daily Mail)Active Shooter or Live Drill?The Daily Mail described the LAX false alarm in the following manner: An actor returning from an audition dressed as masked hero Zorro, complete with plastic sword, shut down LAX airport and sparked fear of an active shooter situation on Sunday night.The unidentified, middle-aged black man dressed in an all black satin costume with gloves, hat and large belt was apprehended on a bench as he waited  for a ride home .Police were initially responding to claims that a man had opened fire near a baggage reclaim, and set about evacuating thousands of passengers and grounding flights.After a thorough search and the eventual arrest of the costumed man outside a terminal, LAPD admitted the entire incident was a false alarm. The Daily Mail article continued by adding that, LAX also tweeted that the reports of a shooting had not been confirmed and police were investigating, before adding which parts of the airport have been shut. Upper/Departures & Lower/Arrivals levels of Central Terminal Area (CTA) closed. Pls check w/ airlines if heading to LAX (sic),  a tweet read. Was it possible that the event at LAX was a drill?  EVACUATION    Passengers ordered to evacuate after reports of an active-shooter at LAX. (Image Source: twitter)LAX International Airport is no stranger to active shooter situations and drills Back in 2002 according to reports,  Hesham Mohamed Hadayet [a person previously known to Egyptian authorities with multiple ID s] 41, went to the ticketing counter of El Al, Israel s national airline, at Los Angeles International Airport July 4 carrying two handguns and a hunting knife. He opened fire at midmorning, killing two people and wounding three others before he was killed by an El Al security guard. The incident occurred days after the airport was slated for a $9.6 billion airport security  redesign proposal,  something that would require passengers to go through screening prior to reaching their terminal for boarding a plane. The event conveniently underscored new security measures put in place after 9/11, insuring the continued growth of the TSA. Additionally, the Hadayet shooting displayed many of the conflicting aspects reported following other high profile shootings today.In 2013 21WIRE reported that the LAPD conducted an  active shooter drill  in October with the Los Angeles Airport Police Department at the L.A./Ontario International Airport, acting out an almost exact scenario that played out during a TSA-related shooting at LAX in November.According to a report by the San Bernardino Sun, written by Doug Saunders, the active shooter drill had an  armed man  shooting  three people  before officers locked down the scene.  THE AIRPORT SHOOTER    LAPD shooting drill at L.A./Ontario International Airport, month prior to LAX shooting in November of  2013.Setting the StageFollowing a major LAPD airport drill a month earlier, it was reported that Paul Ciancia moved through a crowded LAX airport terminal asking people if they were  TSA  agents or not, supposedly letting go those who were not agents prior to opening fire.It was also alleged that Ciancia, was carrying  anti-government and anti-TSA  writings contained in a bag on his person, one such paper was even an apparent reference to the global conspiracy meme NWO (New World Order), adding a conspiratorial twist to the dramatic shootout.All too often we see the  stage persona of any alleged killer being touted as hard evidence, despite the fact that even strong circumstantial evidence of any apparent crime would likely result in many hours of analysis and debate, potentially without a definitive conclusion, even if the evidence eventually reached a court room setting.Mass media appeared to have worked out their own formula for laying out a familiar series of polarizing political points in the aftermath of this  tragic  mass-shooting, as they have with many others since. Appearing once again, to purposefully redirect the public to look at a ready-made laundry list of hateful rhetoric and random writings as an ironclad motive for the crime. Rapidly descending into an overindulgent barrage of media speculation and theorizing.  UNNATURAL BLOOD    Incredibly thick, red acrylic paint-like blood appears next to what is meant to be the  shooter    allegedly a person said to be Paul Ciancia. The image in question was initially released by the NY POST immediately after the incident.Some critics of the event stated that Ciancia s blood could have been mixed with a coagulant called Celox, noting that this blood also looked suspiciously like the blood left at scene of the Boston Bombing.Watch the LAPD describe 2013 s dramatic TSA involved shooting which was allegedly carried out by Paul Ciancia Not more than 3 weeks ago  we practiced the exact scenario that played out today   we played out today.    the LAPD s response to 2013 s LAX shooting The photographs below were obtained from a Facebook page by the name of Team LAX that was referenced in an article by Digital Journalism Saturday, November 2nd, 2013.The Team Lax page, is the official event page for the LAX Airport Police and the images below were posted on October 8th of 2013. Here s a description of the photos from the same post on Facebook: As we posted previously, this past weekend Airport Police officers participated in an active shooter drill at Ontario Airport. An integral part of this training were the many volunteers who brought reality to the scenario by acting as victims. These  victims  were actually Youth Cadets from Airport Police and several divisions of the LAPD. The LAPD cadets came from the following divisions: Pacific, Hollenbeck, Southwest, Mission, Devonshire, Hollywood, West L.A., Topanga, Central, Rampart, Wilshire and 77th. Leading the cadets were Youth Services Officers (YSO s), William Lara and Ericka Holliday from LAXPD and LAPD Sgt. Stephen Showler, Pacific Division Training Coordinator. 69 cadets participated on Saturday and 115 on Sunday. We d like to thank all the Youth Cadets for their participation and boundless energy in making this training so realistic for our officers.   MOCK SHOOTING    Youth Cadets with L.A. airport police act out an  active shooter drill  in October of 2013. (Image Source: SocioEconomic History).The actors used in these  drills  (photo, above) might as well be mannequins, because the idea that you can recreate a real-life defensive strategy from a choreographed shooting scenario is far-fetched, especially when you consider the video game, Hollywood film style, hair-trigger,  shoot first  narrative repetitively on observed during these staged events   offering very little in terms of a defensive game plan.There is no question that active shooter drills have been used to get the public to accept and acquiesce to new  rules of engagement  in the War On Terror era and arguably, they ve flatlined in terms of public safety   while continuing the steady growth of the security apparatus in America and abroad.  SHELTER IN PLACE    The strange scripted scene at JFK International Airport in August after false reports of an active shooter running loose. (Image Source: mashable)The Panic RoomWhile the recent LAX/JFK airport active shooter situations were fear inducing in and of themselves, we once again saw the larger role played by mass media in distorting fact, which was also on display earlier this summer, when they inaccurately claimed there was an active shooter at a US military facility.In July of 2016, while US media including ABC, CNN and other   went into a code orange alert mode for over 2 and a half hours, 21WIRE had already recognized that an apparent  active shooter  situation at Joint Base Andrews was only a drill, and called it correctly when the news first broke.Here s a passage from 21WIRE discussing the nature of the Joint Base Andrews drill: We re told that initial reports of a  active shooter  were prompted by an emergency 911 call to outside law enforcement about a gunman seen on the base. The fact that this alleged  distress call  came from a  staff member  at the Malcolm Grow Medical Facility located inside Andrews (one of the country s most secure closed military facilities) should have raised some pertinent questions   like why base security were not informed first, as one would expect. Furthermore, any reports by the US mainstream media characterizing the event as a genuine  active shooter  crisis should have been immediately squashed by the fact that Joint Base Andrews was also running a no-notice  Active Shooter Exercise scheduled for 9am that morning. Sadly, this did not happen, and all US media outlets began their crisis reporting   complete with the usual panel of security  experts  and  justice correspondents on CNN and other mainstream networks. In an article from the LA Times, we see that the controversial think-tank Rand Corporation is observing the psychological effects of mass shooter/active shooter situations, no doubt gauging the social engineering aspects of these events: For all the investments in post-9/11 security improvements and training, the confusion and chaos stemming from a false report of violence can actually be harder to handle than dealing with a gunman, officials say. The hunt for a gunman takes much longer when there is no one to find. To keep people calm, you d like to say that there s nothing going on, but you don t know that, and you can t say that,  said Brian Jenkins, a security and terrorism expert at Rand Corp., the Santa Monica think tank. People do unpredictable things in panic situations. Adding to the danger of these modern active shooter events, it was recently reported that local law enforcement in Punta Gorda, Florida, accidentally used live rounds during a so-called  shoot/don t shoot  scenario, fatally shooting one woman participating in the drill that suddenly went live. Punta Gorda Police Department (Facebook)Staged Propaganda, False Imagery & Embedded Journo s As staged active shooter drills and mass casualty incidents have become the norm, we ve also seen an escalation in war time images meant to polarize the public, something aimed at shifting attitudes politically.In February 2015, 21WIRE reported how British journalist John Cantlie s video message  From Inside Aleppo  was part of an elaborate PR effort to  humanize  ISIS and its future generation of fighters. The decidedly pro-ISIS video was heavily promoted by the intelligence group SITE as well as the ISIS media arm, Al Hayat Media Center.Mainstream pundits and broadcast journalists maintain that  Cantlie  is and was under duress, having been forced into operating as a crack reporter for the ISIS terror brand. The narrative borders on the ridiculous, yet it has been totally accepted without question.Cantlie s prominent role in the YouTube video series  Lend Me Your Ears,  prompted some in new media circles to question the British journo, along with his links to USAID connected reporter, James Foley   one of the as of yet, forensically unproven deaths at the hands of the estranged terror persona Jihadi John .Nothing in the video appeared to be authentic, as Cantlie failed to disclose the true nature of the West s role in inciting terror in the region, through its various  arms trafficking and  Train and Equip  programs linked to so-called  moderate  rebels in Syria.Recently, 21WIRE contributor Branko Mali  of Kali Tribune, deconstructed another active Gladio-style shooting in Munich, Germany, and its apparent relation to the bizarre incident in Nice, France. In fact, rather uncannily, journalist Richard Gutjahr, was in France to capture the white lorry truck rampage on Bastille Day as well as the strange shooting incident in Munich. Here s a passage from his report, an article which outlines deep media and political ties: He [Richard Gutjahr] is a M nchen based journalist, talk show moderator, blogger and  new media technologies  enthusiast, currently employed by Bavarian TV company, BR 24. For uninitiated into Gutjahr s impressive, if somewhat bizarre, CV his name will probably remain in memory simply because he decided to visit Nice for an  extended weekend  to experience the July, 14. Bastille Day celebration and, quite accidentally, found himself on the balcony of his hotel room, when white lorry driver commenced his rampage. While driving through M nchen, Richard got the call from a friend informing him that there s a shootout in the Olympia-Einkaufszentrum.The whole episode reminds one of Goran Tomasevic, a Serbian photographer who works with Reuters and has also captured pivotal political events over the past 20 years, such as his picture of a U.S. Marine witnessing the toppling of a Saddam Hussein statue, the Arab Spring, so-called moderates in Aleppo and the suspiciously staged Westgate Mall massacre in Kenya in 2013.Similarly, new forms of subliminally arresting and deceptive propaganda have appeared recently in Western media and more broadly, over the past year from NGOs linked to the military alliance NATO and to known Islamist terrorist groups.Over the last two weeks, an emotionally charged scene supposedly depicting a Syrian child rescued after an airstrike became a polarizing story exploited by Western media.Here we see 21WIRE contributor, Jay Dyer of Jay s Analysis discuss the dust boy propaganda Aleppo Syria  Dust Boy  Image StagedWhile watching the entire video footage of the event, the dust-covered boy who appears to be bleeding after an apparent airstrike (yet the blood has already coagulated) is left unattended, as he is oddly propped up in an ambulance seat while being photographed by Mahmoud Raslan   an alleged  media activist  who has been seen fraternizing with terrorist groups in Aleppo. This has prompting some critics to charge that Raslan may actually be linked to the White Helmets, a group funded largely by NATO and an NGO embedded with Al-Qaeda members, who regularly dispense staged humanitarian media images and video for public consumption.From this information, we might observe that the recent so-called rescue operation in Aleppo, was specifically produced for maximum emotional impact and internet viral capability, and always dovetailing with the West s regime change plot in Syria   with the support of a so-called  first-responder  or  human rights  NGO.The strange and disembodied footage of a blood and dust-covered boy, was also reminiscent of last year s migrant crisis image of a child washed ashore   yet the mainstream media failed to question the geopolitical angle behind the photograph as well as the engineered migrant crisis itself.In many ways, this type of drive-by  shock and awe  imagery is linked to past political staging in the Middle East, as well as other hotbed areas around the world. STAGING WAR    An allegedly staged war image from the Ukraine. (Image Source: rt)It was also recently revealed that a war image in the Ukraine had supposedly been staged just as things have been politically been heating up in that region. RT explains:The dramatic picture in question which went viral this month shows two Ukrainian soldiers, carrying their wounded comrade, while a huge explosion is visible behind their backs, sending a plume of smoke into the air.The author of the photo Dmitry Muravsky, an amateur photographer who served as an adviser to the Ukrainian Defense Minister claimed it was made on June 4 in the village of Shirokino, located on the firing line between the government forces and rebels in east Ukraine.However in an open letter signed by numerous Ukrainian journalists and photographers, people claimed it was a fake and said they strongly condemn such manipulative activities. Interestingly, in 2014, The UK s Express discussed a book entitled Five Came Back by movie historian Mark Harris that revealed a handful of legendary Hollywood directors had  faked combat footage in  Second World War documentaries that have been considered genuine for almost 70 years. John Ford, John Huston, Frank Capra, William Wyler and George  Stevens all enlisted despite their  glittering Hollywood lifestyles and joined other filmmakers recording the Allied advance across occupied Europe and in the Pacific.Their films were allegedly created to  boost morale among troops and cinema audiences  the world over, including apparently staging much of the epic scenes during the Pearl Harbor attack in 1944.Additionally, the report states that  Decades later both Capra and Huston admitted in interviews that some of their bogus work was  disgraceful  but  Huston was less frank publicly about the authenticity of his acclaimed documentary The  Battle Of San Pietro, which, in 1991, was selected for America s  prestigious National Film Registry of the Library of Congress because it was considered historically significant.

23278,POLICE STATE END-RUN: DHS Wants Control of U.S. Elections,"21st Century Wire says Here s a classic case of Problem, Reaction, Solution How far will the federal government go to dismantle the US Constitution? Back in 2000, the establishment rigged the US Presidential Election and made Florida and its notorious pregnant chads the centerpiece of that artificial controversy. Predictably, the public reaction is outrage. Suddenly, there are calls nationwide for electronic voting as the solution to the old  inefficient  paper ballot system.Now that electronic voting is all-pervasive in the US, the next problem becomes  cyber security    which the government is referring to as the next burning national security issue.Enter the relatively new and prohibitively expensive Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which ironically (or not) was created by one George W. Bush   a president who was installed into power not by the popular vote, but by a dubious Supreme Court decision in that very same 2000 US Presidential Election. Now DHS head and Obama appointee Jeh Johnson, is nudging towards the idea of the domestic military force taking over the election process. Johnson claims that US elections are part of the country s vital infrastructure and therefore it must be under the control of an already bloated federal agency.What is wrong with a decentralized, traditional paper ballot system? If you are in the business of fixing elections, the answer is simple: paper is too difficult, sloppy and complicated... to hack.It s no coincidence at all that this latest power-grab by the federal government comes immediately after a mainstream conspiracy theory that Russia was somehow behind this week s election database  hack  in Arizona (once again, Putin did it). No proof has been offered by either politicians or media anchors presently parroting this latest sensational plot.Looking back, we can see now that years of excessive lobbying by Washington insider firms eager tosecure lucrative contracts  by implementing a myriad of fatally flawed electronic voting systems  was not a mere accident of nature. It was designed for this very police state end-run we see now.The only problem is that this would be unconstitutional, but does this government really care about constitutional law?Not when you are erecting a police state Barbara Hollingsworth CNS NewsHomeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson s suggestion that state and local voting systems be designated as  pieces of critical infrastructure  so that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can protect them from hackers is unconstitutional and would create a dangerous precedent, legal experts said. The Department of Homeland Security does not have the legal authority to interfere with states  election systems without their permission,  University of California/Berkeley School of LawProfessor John Yoo told CNSNews.com. While the federal government has the general power to protect the nation s cyber infrastructure, it cannot intrude into areas of state sovereignty without clear constitutional mandate. Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution recognizes the authority of the states to regulate the times, places, manner of elections, subject to congressional regulation. As far as I am aware, Congress has not clearly decided to regulate the information systems of state electoral systems or delegated this authority to DHS,  Yoo noted Continue this story at CNS NewsREAD MORE POLICE STATE NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Police State Files",Middle-east,"September 1, 2016"
23279,SpaceX: Explosion Rocks Launchpad at Firm’s Cape Canaveral Facility in Florida," 21st Century Wire says The  privatization of space,  and what were formally state-run NASA space agency projects in the United States, has had its share of high profile controversy in recent years. Today s incident will only punctuate some of those concerns.Early this morning, we re told that an explosion took place at the Launch Complex 40 site in Florida managed by SpaceX, a private space contractor firm founded by billionaire Elon Musk.It s not clear what the exact cause of this accident was, but it s certain that it s directly related to the Falcon 9 rocket which SpaceX was set to deploy as part of a test launch this weekend, leading to the final launch of a new commercial satellite. Watch:Washington PostAn explosion at a SpaceX launch site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida occurred shortly after 9 a.m. Thursday, Brevard County authorities said.A SpaceX rocket blew up during a test fire, the county s emergency operations center said in a tweet.  There is NO threat to general public from catastrophic abort during static test fire at SpaceX launchpad at CCAFS this morning,  it said.Bryan Purtell, a spokesman for the Air Force 45th Space Wing, confirmed that there was an explosion and said that emergency crews were responding.  Right now we re trying to determine the extent of the damage, the exact location, possible cause and checking to make sure no one is injured,  he said.The Associated Press reported that the explosion shook buildings several miles away. Plumes of smoke could seen rising into the air an hour after the accident.

23281,"CONFUSED.GOV: Obama’s Imperial Mideast Policy Unravels, Still Backing Terrorists in Syria","21st Century Wire says We just learned this week that US President Barack Obama will meet with Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan at this week s G20 summit in China. The White House claims that this is to discuss the two nations   Anti-ISIL efforts,  but is this really to be believed, considering the facts on ground in Syria?As 21WIRE reported this past weekend, Turkey has effectively invaded northern Syria. Initially, it claimed its military operation was to support  Syrian rebels  who aimed to recapture territory from ISIS around the town of Jarabulus, but it quickly became apparent that this was only a cover story. During its illegal invasion of its neighbor Syria,  Turkish military were flanked by  moderate rebel  group Faylaq al-Sham   a extremist terrorist organization and more amazingly   both Turkish forces and their  moderate rebel  partners received air support from the United States. That s right: the USA is giving air cover to Al Qaeda in Syria. Consider the Turkish-US invasion along these lines: all along the Syrian Conflict, the US, Turkey, the NATO confab and entirety of the George Soros NGO Complex   have all been crying out for one thing: a  No Fly Zone  or  Safe Zone , which is really a western euphemism for carving-out their long-desired militant safe-havens inside of Syria. An interesting follow-on report to the US side of this drama is featured below by Daniel Lazare from Consortium News.This would be the first meeting between Obama and Erdogan since the infamous failed coup attempt in Turkey in July. Both countries claim to be ensconced in Syria in the gallant  fight against ISIS  (ISIL, IS, Daesh etc), but facts on the ground indicate that neither country has made  fighting ISIS    or any other Sunni-based Islamist extremist fighting group operating in Syria   a genuine priority. It s as if they are both attempting to buy time for their own strategic objectives to develop.What s becoming ever clearer by the day, however, is that Washington is prepared to do almost anything in order to cover-up and obfuscate its central role in the promotion and strategic backing of all militant  rebel  forces trying to destroy the nation of Syria, including Al Nusra Front and all its affiliates, and also ISIS itself.Note below, the henchman role of US Vice President Joe Biden, delivering the death blow to Kurdish YPG militias in Syria  Daniel Lazare Consortium NewsIn the 1930s, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain appeased his enemies. Today, U.S. President Barack Obama appeases his friends.Barack the Appeaser is the key to unlocking the mysteries of U.S. policy in the Middle East and beyond. Confusing to begin with, U.S. actions reached new heights of absurdity last week when the Obama administration abandoned its long-standing Kurdish allies with virtually no notice and announced that it was backing a Turkish thrust into northern Syria instead.Although the Turks claimed to be targeting ISIS (also known as Islamic State, IS, ISIL, and Daesh), it was plain from the outset that the real aim was to counter an offensive that had carried Kurdish forces some 20 miles west of the Euphrates River and put them in a position to control nearly the entire Syrian-Turkish border.But there was a problem. Not only had the U.S. approved the same Kurdish offensive, but it had provided arms, money, and air support plus military advice in the form of some 250 US Special Operations forces embedded among members of the Kurdish militia known as the YPG.Indeed, the Syrian Democratic Forces, a multi-ethnic militia anchored by the YPG, was a real success story, just about the only one Washington has had in the course of its disastrous five-year Syrian intervention. As one analyst put it: Since the creation of the SDF last November, the U.S.-backed coalition was able to roll back IS advances in northern Syria at an unprecedented pace.  An effective mixture of multi-pronged offensives and U.S. air support led to the capture of key IS strongholds, including the city of Shaddadi in eastern Syria, the strategic Tishrin Dam along the Euphrates, and more recently IS s former bastion of Manbij, south of the Turkish border. But now the U.S. had decided to drop the Syrian Democratic Forces despite their sterling anti-ISIS record and back Turkey even though it didn t seem very concerned about ISIS at all. Vice President Joe Biden laid down the law during a visit to Ankara on Wednesday. We have made it absolutely clear,  he said, that Kurdish forces  must move back across the river. They cannot, will not, and under no circumstances get American support if they do not keep that commitment, period. Why the About-FaceWhat is the reason for such a remarkable about-face? What makes the U.S. think it can get away with cultivating an alliance one moment and dropping it like a hot potato the next?The answer has to do with the phenomenon of liberal appeasement that Obama represents.Appeasement became a dirty word as a result of the 1938 Munich Crisis when Britain and France decided that allowing Hitler to dismember Czechoslovakia would somehow allay his appetite for more conquests. But in Obama s hands, it has come to mean something different: an endless attempt to satisfy conflicting demands by a growing number of client states.The states include not just Turkey but Israel, the Persian Gulf oil sheikdoms, plus the dozen East European states that have entered NATO since 1999. If America were an old-fashioned empire, it would issue orders and expect such dependents to fall into line. But as a  democratic  empire, it relies on cajoling, bargaining, and other inducements to achieve  voluntary  consent Continue this story at Consortium NewsREAD MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Syria Files",Middle-east,"August 30, 2016"
23282,NEW EMAILS: Clinton Foundation VIP donors buy access – while Hillary was Secretary of State,"21st Century Wire says In the old days, this scandal would be filed under  gross conflict of interest  or  government corruption . In the America in 2016, it s simply filed under  news. Far from being a great  charity  organization, the Clinton Foundation appears to be merely a vehicle for those who want access to a US-based syndicate of international oligarchs, elite financial institutions, foreign governments, and even dictator-friendly Lebanese-Nigerian billionaires.As 21WIRE reported last week, this international syndicate stretches right through the heartland of Islamist radicalization and state-sponsored terrorism  to the feudal monarchs in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and others.To be sure, this is only the tip of a much larger political iceberg  RTNewly released emails reveal more ties between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department during Hillary Clinton s tenure as secretary of state, showing that major donors received special perks   including lunch with the Chinese president.The State Department emails were released as part of a public records lawsuit by conservative group Citizens United. The documents were then shared exclusively with ABC News. After more than two years of Freedom of Information Act requests and lengthy litigation, the truth is finally coming out,  David Bossie, president of Citizens United, said in a statement.  Hillary Clinton s senior staff at the State Department routinely worked with the Clinton Foundation to reward big donors with special access and favors for four years. The emails seem to suggest that some of the Clinton Foundation s biggest donors were given special treatment, including seats at a meal attended by Chinese President Hu Jintao.One particular email chain dated December 2010 includes correspondence between Clinton s closest aide, Huma Abedin, and then-top Clinton Foundation official Doug Band.The email gives names of those expected to attend a State Department lunch with the Chinese president scheduled for January 2011   and some of the foundation s biggest donors were on the guest list.The list included three executives from organizations that have donated millions to the Clinton Foundation   Bob McCann, then-president of wealth management at UBS; Dr. Judith Rodin, president of the Rockefeller Foundation; and Hikmet Ersek, the CEO of Western Union.According to the Clinton Foundation s website, UBS has contributed between $500,000 and $1 million to the organization. The Rockefeller Foundation has donated between $10 million and $25 million, and Western Union and its foundation has given between $1 million and $5 million.Nearly two weeks after the initial email, Band sent a follow-up requesting that Rodin be seated at Vice President Joe Biden s table. I ll ask,  Abedin wrote in response.In a separate email, Abedin forwarded Band an attachment titled  Updated China RSVP Guest List 1-5-11.

23283,"UNHOLY ALLIANCE: Hillary Clinton’s Saudi Sponsors Support Terrorism, Islamist Extremism"," 21st Century Wire says Amid the tossing and turning of media hit pieces and partisan mud slinging in advance of the US presidential vote in November, very little focus is given on the actual record and policies of Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State.With this week s damning revelations regarding Gulf Arab monarchs buying access into the US State Dept via the Clinton Foundation, a clearer picture is now emerging about how the sponsorship of religious extremism, as well as geopolitical instability in the Middle East and beyond   links directly back to the Clinton global network of international oligarchs. Watch this week s ABC News segment: Based on this line of inquiry, what will four years of a Clinton presidency bring in terms of US foreign policy? A few answers to this question from Global Research  Andre Vltchek Global ResearchIf the West in general and the United States in particular, left the Arab and Muslim world alone and in peace, we would most likely never see all those terrorist attacks, which are rocking the world from Indonesia to France. There would be no Mujahedeen and its mutation into al-Qaeda; in Afghanistan or elsewhere. There would be no traces of the ISIS (or ISIL or I.S. or Daesh or however you choose to call it), in Syria, Iraq, Libya or anywhere else.And the super-conservative Wahhabi Islam, that outdated, freak Saudi mutant, would remain in the religious schools of the ultra-regressive Kingdom, instead of gaining ground all over Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa.Secular IslamBut the West embarked on a brutal, Machiavellian path: it decided to destroy socialist Islam   that (historically) moderate, compassionate and progressive religion. It smashed once secular Egypt; it overthrew the government in socialist Iran and then in near-Communist Indonesia, implanting in all these places horrifically degenerate and fully outdated religious concepts. It used extremists to destroy healthy patriotism and socialism. Like the Brits in the 19th Century ( You can control people s brains, while we will control your natural resources ), the West embraced Wahhabi teaching, because it was able to guarantee full obedience, dictatorial (pro-Western) governance and oppressive feudalism.Islam has been used and abused, manipulated and virtually stripped of its essence. The process has gone so far that two leading Iranian scholars, during my visit last-year to Tehran, declared to me:  In so many parts of the world, the West created an absolutely new religion. We don t recognize it, anymore. It has nothing to do with Islam. If the West in general and the United States in particular, left the Arab and Muslim world alone and in peace, we would most likely never see all those terrorist attacks, which are rocking the world from Indonesia to France Correct. Like a naughty, spoiled and heartless child, the West, after destroying the Soviet Union, painstakingly constructed its new enemy    militant Islam    so it could continue indulging in its favorite activity, which is perpetual conflict, endless wars and plunder.It is as simple as that.The greatest oppressors of the Muslim people, those in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Indonesia have all been closely allied to the West. The most terrible terrorist  Muslim  organizations, from Al-Qaida to ISIS, have been created, armed and supported by the West and its cronies.In Europe and in the United States, the  fear of terrorists  is fully exploited by the Western regime   a global class alliance of plutocrats, in actuality, with headquarters in Washington, where the main military and media muscle reside. It still clings to power mainly thanks to such fear implanted in the brains of  ordinary people .And what about the  War on Terror ? Yes, there really is such war, but the West is not the one who fights it. As this goes to print, the war against terrorism is being fought by Russia, Iran, China, Syria, Hezbollah and their allies!The West is still closely collaborating with the terrorists. It miraculously  avoids targeting them  when  fighting wars against them ; it financially supports some and trains others. It criticizes and antagonizes those who are actually fighting the extremist militant groups.Extremists have been unleashed, like Rottweiler fighting dogs, against almost all progressive governments in the Middle East, but also against China and Russia. Extremist Muslims, extremist Christians, even extremist Buddhists!In turn, the politicians in the United States are regularly supported, financially, by the regimes (including those of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, etc.) that are spreading, relentlessly, throughout the world, the most intolerant and grotesquely violent religious concepts.Despite their essential servility and cowardice, even some North American mainstream media outlets are now actively discussing various schemes involving the financing of the Clinton Foundation by Saudi Arabia (alongside several leading transnational corporations and Wall Street s largest banks).On its  Breaking News , as far back as in 2008, CNN reported:The donations to the William J. Clinton Foundation include amounts of $10 million to $25 million from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and real estate mogul Stephen Bing, a personal friend of the Clintons.The Clintons came under intense pressure during Hillary Clinton s campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination to release the names of donors to both the Foundation and to the Clinton presidential library in Arkansas.Bill Clinton agreed to the release of the list after President-elect Barack Obama nominated Hillary Clinton to become Secretary of State.The governments of Kuwait and Qatar are also on the list, as is Saudi businessman Nasser Al-Rashid, who has close ties to the Saudi royal family. Saudi Sheikh Mohammed H. Al-Amoudi, reputed to be one of the richest men in the world, is among the donors as well. Both Saudis contributed in the $1 million to $5 million range. A group called Friends of Saudi Arabia and the Dubai Foundation appear in the same category.  As recently as on August 20th, 2016, The New York Times wrote something similar, essentially reconfirming the validity of the earlier reports, while adding many more details and adjusting the figures: The kingdom of Saudi Arabia donated more than $10 million. Through a foundation, so did the son-in-law of a former Ukrainian president whose government was widely criticized for corruption and the murder of journalists. A Lebanese-Nigerian developer with vast business interests contributed as much as $5 million.For years the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation thrived largely on the generosity of foreign donors and individuals who gave hundreds of millions of dollars to the global charity. But now, as Mrs. Clinton seeks the White House, the funding of the sprawling philanthropy has become an Achilles  heel for her campaign and, if she is victorious, potentially her administration as well. Long time Clinton s top aide, Huma Abedin (who spent part of her childhood in Saudi Arabia) has been an intermediary between the former Secretary of State and pro-Saudi interests. She also negotiated financial support for Ms. Clinton from Mr. Chagouri and other individuals, organizations and businesses originating from the Middle East.The accusations and evidence keep coming in, from different media outlets, both left wing and right wing. On August 1st, 2016, the conservative Breitbart News stated: Khizr Khan, the Muslim Gold Star father that the mainstream media and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have been using to criticize Donald J. Trump, has deep ties to the government of Saudi Arabia and to international Islamist investors through his own law firm. In addition to those ties to the wealthy Islamist nation, Khan also has ties to controversial immigration programs that wealthy foreigners can use to essentially buy their way into the United States and has deep ties to the  Clinton Cash  narrative through the Clinton Foundation.   Hillary s Saudi SponsorsHillary Clinton s dependence on Saudi sponsors has been strongly influencing her decision to maintain a foreign policy in the service of Riyadh and support for various terrorist groups controlled by Saudi Arabia and Qatar, in and beyond the Middle East region [including those currently active in Syria and Iraq].In reality, she is simply representing  continuity  of an already existing, deadly trend. The regime has been  evolving  for decades, but especially since the Ronald Reagan years. Republicans or Democrats: it truly matters very little. Both parties spread terror all over the world. True, George W. Bush invaded Iraq, but people like Bill Clinton are close friends and supporters of Paul Kagame, the Rwandese  butcher of Congo , with the blood of some 10 million people on his hands. Democrat and  moderate , Bill Clinton, was also responsible for the criminal bombing and destruction of socialist Yugoslavia. And so it goes But under Barack Obama s rule, the last hope for an independent Middle East and the Arab world has virtually evaporated. Libya has been destroyed; the Syrian civil war was launched from Washington, London and Paris. Saudis bathed rebellious Yemen in blood using UK and US produced weapons. Virtually all  Arab Spring revolutions  were infiltrated and diverted. And in Bahrain, the Shi a majority was literally raped by Saudi Arabia and its own ruthless rulers, with British advisors standing-by.The US and Europe have kept selling arms to the Gulf, building new military bases while supporting the most appalling and bloodthirsty regimes.The  Obama/ (Hilary) Clinton Era  has greatly  improved  the symbioses of Western imperialism, big business, and pro-Western fascist regimes worldwide, but particularly in the Middle East and Africa.This toxic embrace has proved fatal to millions of people in these two parts of the world. Hopes for self-governance have been ruined. Corpses keep piling up in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and elsewhere.The West does not care, as long as it stays in charge of the  show , and for as long as hundreds of billions of dollars are made by weapons  producers. Even if millions are dying, there is still an uninterrupted flow of raw materials to the West and Japan. Therefore, it is  business as usual .  Un-people  and their lives are worth nothing.At one point, Russia, Iran, China and others have said  enough is enough; let s fight against the true terrorists! Let s fight ISIS and other bigots! Let s give a hand to the independence-minded, socially-oriented patriots .Predictably,. this led to total outrage in Washington, London, and Paris (and Tokyo). Disobedience and rebellion against the global (Western) order could not be tolerated! It had to be crushed, even at the cost of new and deadly world war.NATO, Washington, Europe, Japan, and South Korea  all started a direct confrontation policy against Russia, China, Iran, North Korea (DPRK) and other members of the  Coalition of Daring . Brazil, an important member of BRICS, was recently destroyed by the extreme-right coup supported by the West.Even the Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump, in his rare moments of sanity, is clearly aware of the danger. He does not wish to confront Russia. He is obviously not willing to sacrifice tens of millions of human lives for some grotesque dreams of total world domination by a market fundamentalism backed by the white (or Western) supremacist dogmas.But Trump s moments of sanity are defined as  madness  by the mainstream propaganda. Not surprisingly! As was correctly stated by the great Indian thinker, Arundhati Roy, some several years ago:  now war is called peace and black is called white . Orwellian indeed, with a vengeance.The Clinton CampaignThe Clinton campaign has gone into overdrive. It attempts to distract attention from its own funding scandals, by accusing Donald Trump s aides of receiving financing from abroad. Trump is now described as  Russia s agent .This game   it is all self-serving: nothing to do with the interests of the world, or even the interests of the common  American people .For as long as the general political trend of the West does not radically change, or for as long as the West is not stopped by outside forces, perpetual wars will continue. Monstrous genocides in Africa, the destruction of entire states and regions in the Middle East, all this could easily spread to other parts of the Planet.It is clear now that if provoked and confronted, countries like China, Russia and Iran would not hesitate to fight back. They also may fight for others   for their tortured allies.The Western implants and their buddies, Mujahedeen/Al-Qaida, have already destroyed Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. ISIS, another mutant unleashed by the West and its allies, have been devastating Iraq, Syria, Libya and now what is left of Afghanistan.These  movements  have really nothing to do with Islam. They were manufactured in Washington, Riyadh, London, and Doha (and most likely even in Tel Aviv), for several concrete purposes, all of them thoroughly foul.They are making sure to ruin the socialist nature of Islam, insisting exclusively on the implementation of outdated, medieval fundamentalist interpretations.Huma Abedin s mother, Dr. Saleha Mahmood Abedin, is one of the founding members of the Muslim Sisterhood, and chairperson of the  International Islamic Committee for Woman and Child  (IICWC). She is also a well known writer and editor based in Saudi Arabia. Her organization (IICWC) had repeatedly argued that laws banning female circumcision should be revoked, as well as laws prohibiting child marriage and marital rape. During her visit to KSA, Hillary Clinton spoke at the Islamic college of Dar El-Hekma (where Dr. Saleha Abedin was a vice-dean) shoulder-to-shoulder with her favorite aide   Huma.Was this just an insignificant episode? Like those millions of dollars in Saudi Arabian funding for Clinton s foundation? Like the US  foreign policy  in the Gulf and in the Middle East, like spreading Muslim extremist groups to all corners of the world, from Africa, the Middle East, to Southeast Asia and even China? Like unleashing conservative Islam against socialist Muslim countries?Too many  episodes ! Too much blood  It is time to say what is by now obvious:  The US establishment is not fighting  Muslim terrorism  or even  extremism ; it is manufacturing it, and injecting it everywhere. The only real enemy that Washington, London and Paris have, for decades, even for centuries, is the anti-colonialist struggle, and the burning desire of people, worldwide, to terminate the West s global dictatorship.

23285,TOXIC CULTURE: ‘Suicide (Skank) Squad’ Film,"Jay Dyer 21st Century WireSuicide squad is who they call to counsel the people leaving this vapid movie.  Possibly the worst superhero film yet, it even rivals the likes of Spawn, Catwoman and Ghost Rider.  At least there was Nic Cage, but here, only a confused and garbled CGI wasteland that is as messy as the single mom tats emblazoned every scene.  Nothing in this movie makes sense, much less is the plot even coherent, as a selection of  the worst  of America s convicts are chosen to become Task Force X, a microchipped hit team to take on the  meta-humans  (X-men, yawn) and the extra-dimensional entities that possess two paper-thin characters.Side note   the film is adapted from my old essay, United Skanks of America.This film is one of the few instances I can think of where the overt propaganda is actually more interesting to spot than the film itself.  Will Smiff plays a  hitman  baby-daddy whose only concern is scoring 2 million dollars to buy his daughter s attention.  Yes, all those noble baby-daddies are really just striving for ghetto release so they can become responsible parents.  Next, a hot chick plays a psychiatrist babe-turned skank who, after falling in love with the joke that is  The Joker,  morphs into the average American skank, graffiti ed to the hilt with thug-style sleaze.  In this sense, Harley Quinn makes sense as a representation of the mental illness that plagues the young western female, as evidenced in their body-defacing obsessions and self-mutilation.Planetary sigils adorn the headdress.As Matt Forney writes:No girl has ever improved her looks with a gaudy mural injected under her skin or a piece of metal dangling from her nostrils. There s no man on Earth who has ever thought about his girlfriend or wife, Man, you know what would make her even sexier? A butterfly emblazoned just over her ass. Yet, despite this objective reality, thousands of girls continue to mutilate themselves at an astounding rate, to the point where more girls now have tattoos than men.Indeed, nothing captures the full throttle ruination of the western female than this slut character which drives the ridiculous simulacrum of a plot by seeking to be reunited with Joker Leto.  Since Grant Morrison is an open fan of Crowley, chaos magick and summoning entities through sigils, I am curious which god he offended to have the legions of suck demons inspire his advice to Leto.  That is the only explanation.The Crowleyan elements of this film are really the only noticeable  esoteric  themes, with the Joker now being apparently bi-sexual (perfect embodiment of the ruined western male), and the planetary sigils that adorn Cara Delevingne s headdress.  From here, you can divine the rip off of a rehash semblance a story   a giant garbage vortex  has opened up over a city with the intent of destroying humans who no longer worship the entities as gods.  The giant garbage vortex was actually filmed when in reality it opened up over New York the night this film premiered.Faith, the  Hillary-hero. Originally, the skank squad was formed through the machinations of Reagan (presumably based on the Latin American death squads) and now, even Obama plays a positive role in the storyline from the comic.  Indeed, comic books have long been tools of propaganda, from World War 2 Americanism to Cold War absurdity, comic books have been a staple in the establishment-promoted anti-establishment toxic culture.The sad fact, as I have been arguing for a long damn time now, is that the increase in corporate government control of entertainment realm only results in the degeneration of artistic creativity.   I can wait for the 5th version of the plot of Ghostbusters-Avengers-Ghostbusters-Suicide Squad, but can you?  Aside from this, the other amazing, little-known tidbit is that since the market for comics is generally teenagers, the script was written by a teen   how else would an ancient goddess lithely intone,  You don t have the balls! ?Nowadays, comic books are the tip of the queer spear in promoting transgender  heroes,  fat acceptance heroes that promote Hillary, and the absurd reversing of racial and gender roles (such as Thor becoming a woman and Iron Man a black girl).  The cultural degeneration and toxification is a symbiotic relationship   as the west devolves at lightning speed into a troglodyte, Morlock genetic experiment, the comic book world then comes to reflect that gluttonous, scooter-bedeviled psych ward in its  art. Since comic books now drive the film industry s big blockbuster productions, blockbuster films continue to foist the Disney-Degeneration of social justice warriors rabidly attempting to quell dissent.Meanwhile, the self-devouring ouroboros of the left is its own punishment and destruction.  In sum, don t waste your time, as it s all chaos, and no magic.  However, if you liked John Leguizamo s farting clown in spawn, you ll probably love the ebonics-speaking crocodile in this garbage.The comedy gold of the farting clown.

23288,Falling Apart: West’s Media-Driven Deception in Syria,"21st Century Wire says The wagon wheels are already coming off of the NATO-GCC  regime change  road show in Syria.Now, foreign policy buffoons in Washington are resorting to some of the most desperate tactics seen yet, including more semantic maneuvers to try and conceal their lethal aid for jihadist terrorists in Syria and Iraq.Washington s latest PR thrust began last week when it was proudly announced in the US media Al Nusra Front (Al Qaeda in Syria) was  rebranding  itself into a newer, supposedly kinder and gentler terrorist moniker,  Syrian Conquest Front.  Charming.Washington spin doctors are now desperately back-pedaling, following an embarrassing challenge by Donald Trump to both President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton   claiming it was they who  founded ISIS  (see article below). Contrary to all facts and multiple previous admissions, Washington are now claiming that it has never backed and armed terrorists, but rather  non-Jihadist Salafists  (an oxymoron). The other popular lie that Washington and the other NATO governments have been pushing is that the Syrian  rebels  are actually from Syria. The reality is that the overwhelming majority of terrorist  rebel  fighters are from outside Syria   soldiers of fortune and paid privateers from as many as 81 different countries of origin.SEE ALSO: Proof: US and NATO-backed  Rebels  Are NOT Fighting ISISIt s clear now that Washington has dug such a deep hole with regards to its sponsorship of the dirty war in Syria that it simply cannot get out without losing face internationally   and domestically.The domestic side is particularly worrisome for Democratic Party leaders Obama and Clinton, because it is an election year and Clinton has built most of her campaign on her  foreign policy credentials  which now includes the prenatal and pediatric development of ISIS and Al Nusra Front. To say that Clinton was one of the architects of the current conflict is no exaggeration, as she was actively promoting  regime change  by any means in Europe and the Middle East in 2011 and 2012 with her cynically titled  Friends of Syria  controlled opposition tour. FRONT: Hillary Clinton fronted the  Friends of Syria  tour through 2011-2012, in order consolidate Gulf and other support for  regime change  and the present dirty war in Syria.To those who have been reading between the western spin on Syria over the last 4 years, the truth about this Washington-led Dirty War in Syria should come as no surprise: that the Obama Administration s policy of supporting extremist armed terrorist  opposition  groups in Syria was part of a deliberate strategy explicitly designed to topple the government in Damascus and its elected president Bashar al-Assad. By doing this, Washington and its allies have facilitated the creation of Islamic State (ISIS, ISIL, IS or  Daesh )  caliphate  in Syria and Iraq.A recent Sputnik article confirms how Hillary Clinton pressed through the policy of backing the myriad of known extremist terrorist groups by just referring to them as  moderate rebels :In December 2012, only months after the defense intelligence report, President Obama caved to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the more hawkish wing of the national security establishment saying the United States considered the opposition to be  the legitimate representative of the Syrian people. By maintaining a strict policy of media deception regarding Syria, the US State Department believed that it could avoid any responsibility and obfuscate its own sponsorship audit trail by playing a sophomoric and highly cynical name game between  moderate rebels  and known terrorist organizations like Jabhat al-Nusra Front (Al Qaeda in Syria), Jaysh al-Islam, Ahrar al-Sham, Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki, the Turkmen Brigades and many more. Aside from those living in the reality bubble that is Washington and its media stable, most people are now well aware that there are no  moderate rebels  in Syria   and no matter how many name changes are announced by operatives at CNN or SITE Intelligence   they are still all terrorists and they are all fighting (including ISIS) together to overthrow the government in Syria. 21WIRE previously covered CNN s sordid role in running PR for the jihadist terrorists groups in Syria, led by CNN s star  journalist , Clarissa Ward (pictured above, in her  Undercover Muslim  costume), who has become one of the corporate media s leading apologists for US-NATO and GCC-sponsored violent militant extremists presently running amok in Syria, as CNN and Ward have gone out of their way to try and rehabilitate US-NATO and GCC-backed terrorist suicide bombers in Syria.Interestingly, CNN s media operative Ward even took the PR roadshow to the UN, using her CNN-Pentagon profile to push out Washington s new pro-Al Nusra (Al Qaeda) PR campaign. Sputnik added here: Perhaps embodying the confusing about face of America s foreign policy in Syria was when a member of the press, CNN s senior international correspondent Clarissa Ward, testified before the UN Security Council on the situation in Aleppo that  the only ones who have emerged as heroes on the ground  are the Islamist factions, even to those who hate fundamentalism.  LEADING FROM BEHIND: Obama kept insisting that,  Assad Must Go. For years now, US President Obama, Secretaries of State John Kerry and Hillary Clinton et all have been clamouring in unison that,  Assad Must Go . Now it looks as if Assad might outlast all of them.While the blatant distortion of reality continues by the US State Department and its media functionaries like Clarissa Ward and CNN, the West s dirty war in Syria rages on   and with Washington, NATO and Saudi-Qatari money and arms still flowing   there is no end in sight . SputnikThe Obama administration s policy in Syria of opposing Assad at all costs has led the United States to make strange bedfellows arming non-Jihadist Salafist groups who are unfortunately led by a cadre of fighters from the former al-Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front.This week Republican nominee Donald Trump caused an uproar by insisting that his Democratic rival former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her former boss President Barack Obama  founded ISIS    a charge that led to an counter assault by Hillary surrogate Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) on Sunday who levelled a mirror accusation against Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.While a Pentagon memo supports the allegation that in 2012 the United States was willingly aiding al-Qaeda in Iraq and the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) that subsequently metastasized into Daesh, the more immediate conflict of interest in Washington s foreign policy in the Middle East is the support of the current so-called  moderate rebels  opposing Assad who, by their own admission on social media, are led by al-Nusra Front.Al-Nusra Front, who just changed their name to the Syrian Conquest Front and renounced affiliation with al-Qaeda, with the open acceptance of the terror network, in a bid to garner new support from the West were the leading force in the surprise bid to break the Syrian government s siege in Aleppo Continue this article at SputnikREAD MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Syria Files",Middle-east,"August 16, 2016"
23289,"CULT CRIMES, MASS SHOOTINGS & MEDIA MIND CONTROL: Natural Born Killers (1994)","Shawn Helton 21st Century WireThe 1994 cult film Natural Born Killers, is an examination of media manipulation, archetypal psychology and the violence embedded within American pop culture.Although it s been more than two decades since Natural Born Killers (NBK) first shocked viewers with its adrenaline fueled brutality, biting satire and darkly ironic media montages, the enigmatic picture s overall depiction of the American media complex is just as effective today.  CHAOS ROAD    Mickey and Mallory Knox are depraved icons in the twisted world of NBK. (Photo illustration: Shawn Helton)On the film s jarring surface, we see Micky (portrayed by Woody Harrelson) and Mallory Knox (Juliet Lewis) metaphorically reborn (from their violent past) as outlaw-lovers embarking on a psychopathic cross country murder spree   but as well come to find out, there s much more to this psychologically challenging piece of cinema.Over the years, NBK has seen comparisons to Hollywood crime classics such as the Badlands (1973), Bonnie and Clyde (1967), the serial killer  mockumentary , Man Bites Dog (1992), as well as the dystopian mind-bender, A Clockwork Orange (1971). NBK has also been thematically linked to Network (1976), another motion picture with a scathing appraisal of mass media, as well as the 1960 s road-film Easy Rider (1969), and the strikingly similar dark thriller Kalifornia (1993), which also starred Juliet Lewis playing a near identical role.In many ways, much of the media driven subtext of NBK has never seemed more relevant than now, as the film recognized mass media s growing obsession with violence and trashy entertainment all at once. The film also acknowledged the public s fixation with reality TV in all of its incarnations, perhaps envisaging the multi platform information craze in the age of social media.To this day, the Oliver Stone directed controversial feature Natural Born Killers (Based on a story by Quentin Tarantino) remains a harsh critique of American media and pop culture, as it casts a spotlight on the lurid agitprop used to steer public perception through various forms of infotainment.Over the course of this analysis, we ll explore some of the underlying aspects of Natural Born Killers, as well as contextualize its relation to real-life violence seen in the modern era   CULT OF PERSONALITY    Natural Born Killers reflects the heartless transformation of mass media.On The Road: Tragedy & SatireFrom the outset, sight, sound and mood take precedence over a traditional narrative structure throughout NBK. The film begins with a roadside montage of predatory animals (coyote, eagle rattlesnake) struggling to survive while Leonard Cohen s classic song  Waiting for the Miracle  slowly fades in creeping along to the foreboding imagery. The sequence subliminally conjures the all too familiar eugenics based  survival of the fittest  axiom   something which reflects the ruinous and fractured socio-political environment that has become so pervasive in modern America.All the while, the action shifts dramatically from grainy black-and-white footage of America s Southwest, to a red filtered glow, then back to full color, as elliptical-style editing (as well as cross-cutting and parallel) sets the tone for the illusory motion picture magnified by its tension inducing dutch-style camera angles.18 different film formats were used to create NBK in addition to many unusual lighting techniques   everything from black-and-white to dusty old 8mm, to 16mm, to 35mm stock, to CCTV video and animation.  DINE & DASH    NBK sees Mickey Knox on a quest to become Nietzsche s  Overman. When the establishing sequence of NBK finally settles inside the 5 to 2 Cafe, we see a television rapidly changing channel to channel   going from the all-american series Leave It to Beaver, to 77 Sunset Strip, a late 1950 s secret agent crime drama, to the resignation speech of President Richard Nixon, which is juxtaposed against an old horror film relic featuring Boris Karloff.The short panning shot is emblematic of America s dark evolution during the 20th century and serves as a stark bell weather for the rest the high paced surreal picture. In fact, strategically placed images, products and objects are seen throughout the entirety of NBK, evoking a strong emotional response in the viewer   bringing to mind the psychology behind propaganda.   DAEMON    Subliminal dissolves bring a mystical depth to NBK.In the movie s first scene, the camera slips across the cafe, sliding past a character later revealed to be Owen Traft (Arliss Howard), who is a guardian angel or daemon, linked to the Knox pair. Traft vanishes before our eyes (Traft is later seen in the film s prison break sequence) while reading a newspaper about the highway  666  murders, prefiguring the dark media frenzy soon to envelop the Knox outlaws.Celebrating after a fresh deer kill, a pack of foul-mouthed cowboys file into the 5 to 2 Cafe. We then see Mickey order a key lime pie, as his partner in crime Mallory, looking part prostitute, part Pocahontas, seductively dances to the jukebox. Mickey surveys the room and a bright toxic green is contrasted against some of the action within the scene. While some green tones traditionally have a calming restorative quality, the kind used in NBK denotes a sickness inside the mind.  SPIRIT ANIMAL    NBK s cafe cowboys run over a scorpion on the road, impacting their  fate  when facing Mallory and her quasi-totem.Shortly thereafter, Mallory challenges one of the boozed-up misogynistic buckaroos to hand to hand combat just as L7 s Shit List kicks in on the jukebox. The cafe scene erupts into chaos as the soon-to-be famous fugitives dispatch all but one person (the pinball cowboy) in the roadside cafe. The pinball cowboy is kept alive to tell the tale of Mickey and Mallory, in a twisted version of the counting game Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.Following the murderous cafe ruckus, the Knoxes ride out into the desert as wild dissolves intertwine with projected news clippings, images of past crimes and the Hydra myth in the form of a monster flick clip. Additionally, there s a musical schizophrenia to NBK, with a collection of modern and classic songs intermixed with fragmented and atmospheric snippets, signifying a faded, yet stitched together memory in the Trent Reznor/Jane Hamsher selected soundtrack.Later on during a roadside pit stop, Mallory invokes the Book of Revelations and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, as she describes seeing a vision of Mickey riding a red (war) horse, while suggesting the star-crossed lovers might be fallen angels. At that same moment, a floating image of a multi-armed Mallory is seen in the sky, bringing to mind the devouring Hindu goddess Kali.  CUPID S REVENGE    NBK s dingy satire of TV sitcoms of old in  I Love Mallory  serves as a dysfunctional backdrop to Mickey and Mallory s hard-edged romance.Oedipal, Electra & the Hidden OrderContinuing by the roadside, the scene drifts into a dream sequence/flashback in the form of a 1950 s style sitcom parody entitled  I Love Mallory.  Here we see Mallory s dysfunctional family completely controlled by her abusive and incestuous father Ed Wilson (Rodney Dangerfield). The scene is an inversion of the soft TV sitcoms dominating the airwaves in real-life, as the lecherous Wilson unleashes a disturbing diatribe amid a background laugh-track.During the same scene, a deliveryman named Mickey enters the frame, falling in love with Mallory at first sight. Mickey leaves with Mallory and in the process steals Ed s car. Later, Mickey is arrested and imprisoned, managing to escape from a prison work farm during a tornado. NBK s tornado prison break, may be seen as a reference to the classic film The Wizard of Oz  a storm system which forever alters Mickey s future world.Mickey and Mallory return to the Wilson residence, seeking revenge on Mallory s father and mother, in what could be seen as a loose interpretation of the dark lyrical finish to the enigmatic song The End by The Doors. The Wilson s are murdered in a shocking home invasion scene and the house is set ablaze, while Mallory s brother Kevin (Sean Stone) is set free during the inferno.With each new set of kills, Mickey and Mallory grow closer and after their demented Oedipal/Electra complex resolution at the Wilson residence, the two get hitched in a blood ritual ceremony filmed on the scenic Rio Grande Gorge Bridge in Taos, New Mexico. Here Mickey proclaims the couple s  marriage  is sanctified because he is the god of his world, conjuring Friedrich Nietzsche s Overman concept, as well as a Apollonian/Dionysian influence within the killer s process.In an analysis entitled,  The Dionysian and the Apollonian in Nietzsche: The Birth of Tragedy,  by Alexander Gatherer of Cardiff University, we are provided a more detailed look at both the Apollonian and Dionysian philosophical concepts: The opposing concepts of the Dionysian (hereon DI) and Apollonian (hereon AP) are central themes within Nietzsche s first major work, The Birth of Tragedy (hereon BT). His contemplation of such opposing forces of nature are primarily used to analyse Greek culture in general, and Greek art in particular, stating that its role in Greek attic tragedy places these plays at Greece s cultural pinnacle. Continuing, Gatherer s essay analyzes critical aspects of AP and DI: Nietzsche s concepts of the AP and DI, along with the entirety of BT, were not well received initially: the author himself called the book  badly written, ponderous, embarrassing, image-mad and image-confused  (Sweet, 1999, p.49). However, the ideas have left a notable legacy and are still discussed in matters of ethics, politics and art. Indeed, Michael Motta (1991) likens the opposing forces to mental illness, stating how stages of mania in bipolar artists can be likened to that of the DI ( The urge to create is great, but the ability to step back, to control the process is reduced ), with depressive phases linked to the AP ( Critique and reflection take precedence over impulsivity, inhibition holds sway over exhibitionism ). With this in mind, we can interpret Mickey and Mallory s unresolved tension between AP and DI, as a philosophical reason for their dissent into madness.Although in Stone s view, Mickey and Mallory are tragically flawed because of a failed system, which frames the prison system, the police system and mass media, as the true American criminals. However, this ideological stance of the film is itself a false paradigm stuck in a social justice vortex, while masked in Carl Jung s rebel archetype   pointing to Stone s sometimes radical political perspective.Returning to NBK, we see Mickey and Mallory make a blood pact and exchange snake rings presented by Mickey, who is connected to the reptilian realm via his Caduceus chest tattoo. At significant points during NBK, snake imagery is observed, recalling the occult and mythological associations of the serpent. Additionally, there seems to be a Shiva/serpent attachment linked to Mickey as a counterpart to Mallory s Kali connection, with an underlying current of the symbol of immortality, Ouroboros. Other distorted biblical themes are also echoed during NBK, such as the Book of Genesis and the Garden of Eden  exemplified by Mickey s assisted escape from prison by a rattlesnake.Many associations are often seen throughout NBK, which reflect a deeper archetypal presence contained within the film.In Anton Ehrenzweig s The Hidden Order of Art, we can explore a deeper analysis of the unconscious mind   many elements that relate to the main characters in NBK: Some evidence of creative work and poemagogic phantasy points to incomplete superego maturation as an important source of mental illness. The ego has not absorbed the death instinct into the mute workings of the creative process so that self-destruction goes rampant to destroy entire itself. In other words, Mickey and Mallory lack any mature ethical component, which leads to their shared self-destructive psychosis, which in turn, is acted out in their murderous rage. Ehrenzweig, coined the phrase poemagogic, which is interpreted as an aspect emblematic of inducing the ego s creativity in a layered dream state. The nightmare/dream state of Mickey and Mallory visually comes to life in the strewn together time-worn scenes of NBK, like fragmented vitriolic memories.  BLOOD BOND    A ritualistic roadside marriage filmed on the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge.Media Made Political AgitatorsWhen NBK continues, all of the berserker-like chaos is captured by Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr.), a ratings consumed tabloid host on the fictitious television series American Maniacs. A show which obsessively covers the violent action of Mickey and Mallory at any cost. Gale is an amalgam of Australian TV s investigative host Steve Dunleavy and the long time reporter and talk show host Geraldo Rivera.American Maniacs uses the image of cult leader Charles Manson, University of Texas shooter Charles Whitman, and the sadistic killer Richard Ramirez during its credits, setting the tone for a sordid crime show reminiscent of The Current Affair and Hard Copy. NBK s representation of popular true crime programming, gives the film another disturbing art imitates life layer. In one scene, Gale describes the targeted killing of several law enforcement officers at the hands of the Knoxes   which ironically, reflects many real-life crimes we see plastered across today s headlines in America.All in all, American Maniacs very well could have been a template for the seedy video-stringer film Night Crawler, while packaged in the marketing gloss of American Gladiators. In a world of news makers, Gale says  repetition works,  and when questioned over reusing reenacted death scenes by producers, he callously exclaims do you think those nitwits out there in zombieland remember anything.  This is where we see Gale s mind warping programming taking shape for maximum psychological impact.This is what Stone s film is truly about, showcasing the often cold-hearted and calculating nature of mass media s carefully engineered narrative.With media analysis in mind, we might also consider this passage from Cult of Distraction in The Mass Ornament by film theorist, sociologist and writer, Siegfried Kracauer: Here, in pure externality, the audience encounters itself; its own reality is revealed in the fragmented sequence of splendid sense impressions. Were this reality to remain hidden from the viewers, they could neither attack nor change it; its disclosure in distraction is therefore of moral significance. Whether its banal programming intermixed with mass media s terror lens, the viewer has a choice to accept the media manipulated distractions at wholesale or attempt to unpack them through critical thinking, questioning the very nature of reportage.   AMERICAN MANIAC    Gale s American Maniacs glorifies tragedy for ratings.As NBK moves forward, we see the media trail and trial of Mickey and Mallory after the duo has been taken into custody. In a mockumentary style scene centered around super-fans and tacit supporters of the Knoxes, there s a decidedly social justice flair to a series of fictitious man on the street interviews.The whole segment relates to various political agitator groups that we see today   like Occupy Wall Street (OWS) and the controversial identity focused activism of Black Lives Matter (BLM), as well as the FBI and the CIA s various counter-intelligence programs from the 1960 s and 1970 s. Both OWS and BLM alliances, are neo-liberal think-tank/NGO designed gatherings, meant to divide and control participants over class, identity and other socio-political concerns.NBK s court house scene featuring fervid  group-think  supporters, could be seen as another signal of social strife in America at the turn of the century   marked pointedly by the polarizing corruption of the 1992 L.A. riots, the gross federal negligence of both the Ruby Ridge incident and the Waco siege, as well as the heavily publicized Menendez murder case (the strange and salacious trials of Lorena Bobbit and Tonya Harding) and the show trial of O.J. Simpson, an all-time ratings bonanza   not counting the 95 million who watched Simpson s car chase on live TV.Interestingly though, the choreographed bombing of the World Trade Center (1993) carried out by FBI handlers and federal informants, was a curiously under reported event at the time. Which could be a reason for its absence from the media montages seen throughout NBK.The volatility of the 1990 s, proved to be an ideal backdrop for NBK, a picture made during a wave of high-profile sensationalized crime. MOTEL MAYHEM    The murderous  bride and groom  conjuring the death of Mickey s innocence at the Lodge. Later on in NBK, with symbols fully on display, we see close camera shots of the pair s tattoos   Mickey s light and dark Yin and Yang symbol and crudely drawn Christ-like tattoo are contrasted against Mallory s scorpion ink, as they ride along to abduct a hostage. As they make their way to the neon-lit Log Cabin Lodge, there very well could be a subtle reference to Freemasonary, when we witness the ritualistic behaviour shown at the  Lodge.  Stylistically, the motel resembles something out of the macabre cinematic world of David Lynch.In the background while Mickey and Mallory are on the motel bed, projected images on a window pane range from clips of raging dictatorships, to a young Mickey haunted by his father s suicide and a pale horse   recalling the book of revelations once again. All of this takes place while a violent torture scene from the Hollywood film Scarface (written by Oliver Stone) plays out on the TV in front of their hostage.When love turns dark, Mickey and Mallory argue as time-lapse imagery of a Pray Mantis is seen   symbolizing the need for contemplation during their chaos. The two separate briefly, as shamanic chanting cascades over their turbulent night crimes with visions of terror projected onto the sides of buildings.Whether its quick cut edits of opposing and often disturbing montages mixing vitriolic live action, clever special effects, absurdly horror filled projections or startling animated graphics reminiscent of Pink Floyd s The Wall  NBK is a conceptual master work.As the hallucinogenic and often kinetic film progresses, a massive manhunt for the deranged Knoxes is launched by Detective Jack  Super Cop  Scagnetti, a masochistic vigilante law-man (Tom Sizemore) who has his own repressed demons to contend with, which manifest in his psychotic behavior towards prostitutes.We later learn that Scagnetti s mother was gunned down by the infamous shooter Charles Whitman at the University of Texas in 1966.  ROADSIDE SHAMAN    The Knoxes come face to face with themselves during Red Cloud s vision.Shifting mood once again, we hear the haunting piano-driven History Repeats Itself  by A.O.S, (named after the 60 s counterculture chemist and sound engineer, Augustus Owsley Stanley III) which atmospherically plays in the background as Mickey and Mallory high on hallucinogens, are lost, out of gas and at odds with one another. This is the first time Mallory questions Mickey and nature of events that led to her becoming a spree killer.While looking for gas, the Knoxes approach Red Cloud and his grandson, first passing by Jacob (four-horned) sheep, revealing another biblical reference with the presence of the rare breed of sheep guardians. This is another significant scene in NBK, as the sovereign Oglala Lakota activist Russell Means, adds unique depth to the sequence playing the Navajo, Warren Red Cloud (perhaps a reference to US Marine Mitchell Red Cloud).Once inside Red Cloud s hut, the inner turmoil of the Knoxes is exposed. We then learn that Red Cloud served in the Vietnam War, reminding one of the staged Gulf of Tonkin false flag that led to the war. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted President Lyndon B. Johnson the ability to militarily engage in a full-scale conflict with North Vietnam, was made possible due to the fabrication of a crime.During the latter half of the Vietnam War, the development of controversial counter-terrorism techniques was at the utmost importance for then Director of the CIA, William Colby. One such program materialized named The Phoenix Program (Operation Phoenix), which employed various terror tactics to destabilize the North Vietnamese leadership, claiming to have eradicated the Vietcong through the use of psy-ops, extortion, the release of criminals and random targeting of civilians to achieve its aims. Some geopolitical critics believe that this template for destabilization has been used in Afganistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria in recent years.Given that Stone himself was a Vietnam veteran in the US Army, we can view that the deliberate inclusion of Red Cloud s service record was a significant aspect to the story, perhaps reflecting the false premise that the Vietnam War was based upon.  SKIN-WALKER    Mickey s inner demons come to the surface prior to killing Red Cloud.The pivotal scene with Red Cloud dramatically altered the emotionally unhinged killers, who were taken on a shamanic journey and forced to face their own reality during a cleansing ritual involving chanting, fire and snakes. Here Mickey s torment and abuse comes to the surface with vivid drug induced flashbacks and after being haunted by his past, he awakens and shoots Red Cloud. The tragic death of Red Cloud, is the first time both Mickey and Mallory feel the weight of their actions.With an axe to grind against mass murders Mickey and Mallory, Scagnetti, manages to apprehend the pair in a dramatic shootout at the Drug Zone pharmacy after they were bitten by rattlesnakes following their quasi-spiritual pilgrimage conducted by Red Cloud. While observing the Drug Zone s logo we see the Caduceus image (winged staff wrapped with two snakes) often inappropriately used in medicine, as it is said to be the conductor of the dead.  DRUG ZONE    subconscious slogans envelop Mickey in the Drug Zone shootout with police. This neon green filtered scene also represents the poisonous consumer culture, as Mickey and Mallory, drugged and snake bitten, stalk to store for anti-venom like the walking dead. Mike Smith s energetic cartoon animation is also featured, as the pharmacist ID s the pair while watching Gale s American Maniacs. Mickey revels in his newfound celebrity catching himself on TV, before he and Mallory are taken in by Scagnetti.  WATCHTOWER   Charles Whitman opened fire on the 27th story of the University of Texas clock tower on August 1st, 1966 in one of the most well-known mass shootings in American history. (Image Source: hartford courant)Scagnetti later hatches a scheme to kill Mickey and Mallory with the fast-talking neurotic Warden Dwight McClusky (Tommy Lee Jones), who plans his own twisted brand of justice inside the riotous Batonga Penitentiary. When Scagnetti s plot fails during NBK s prison riot scene, Mallory executes him in her cell.Scagnetti s fictitious link to a well-known true crime, merges the illusory world of NBK with the UT shooting, subconsciously grafting fantasy onto a traumatic event. In effect, the concept mimics the way news stories sometimes strangely and unexpectedly overlap within a blended hyper-reality of fact and fiction.In recent years, there has been a series of surreal and unreal news stories since the Smith-Mundt Act was effectively rendered obsolete by US lawmakers on July 2nd 2013, as confirmed by RT below: Until earlier this month, a longstanding federal law made it illegal for the US Department of State to share domestically the internally-authored news stories sent to American-operated outlets broadcasting around the globe. All of that changed effective July 2, when the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) was given permission to let US households tune-in to hear the type of programming that has previously only been allowed in outside nations. The Smith-Mundt Act has ensured for decades that government-made media intended for foreign audiences doesn t end up on radio networks broadcast within the US. An amendment tagged onto the National Defense Authorization Act removed that prohibition this year. There has been an unprecedented increase in propaganda over the years, despite claims that the NDAA provision offered more transparency to the American public.On another note, there are other uncanny historical elements associated with NBK Fresh off his fame from the hit sitcom Cheers, Woody Harrelson was an intriguing choice to play the character Mickey Knox, as it emerged that his father Charles Harrelson, was a contract killer linked to organized crime. Charles was convicted in the murder of a grain dealer named Sam Degelia Jr in 1968. Later in 1981, he received two life sentences for the murder of US District Judge John H Wood.   THREE TRAMPS    Charles Harrelson (ID d by forensic experts on the left) is believed to be one of three arrested in Dealey Plaza after JFK s assassination in 1963. (Image Source: jfkmurdersolved)It has been stated that after a six-hour  suicidal  standoff with police in 1980, Charles, apparently  high on cocaine  admitted to killing Judge Wood, while also claiming to be involved in President John F. Kennedy s assassination.When considering the Harrelson-Kennedy connection, the 1989 book Crossfire comes to mind.Crossfire, written by the well-known researcher Jim Marrs, was also adapted for the highly controversial and successful Oliver Stone film JFK. Below is a passage from Crossfire, as it relates to the apparent Harrelson-Kennedy link: Aside from being twice convicted of murder for hire, Harrelson   the father of actor Woody Harrelson   had a long history of involvement with Dallas underworld characters linked directly to Jack Ruby. Continuing, the Crossfire also stated: The late Fort Worth graphics expert Jack White, who testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations, already had noticed the resemblance of Harrelson to the youngest tramp. In a 1981 interview with Chuck Cook, Harrelson claimed to have the  biggest story  the reporter would ever have, when questioned about Kennedy s death. Additionally, Jo Ann Harrelson noted the  similarities  between the tramp photos and her husband. All this coupled with the fact Diane Lou Oswald (the mother of Woody), who had also been married to Charles Harrelson in Midland, Texas, made for a strange background concerning the JFK saga.Throughout 1981, more questions materialized regarding the assassination of Judge Wood in a UPI article, as Defense lawyers maintained [Charles] Harrelson was framed by police and the informant.  Charles an ex-felon, said a friend, Hampton Robinson III, who failed to show up to testify, had driven the car. He suggested someone, possibly federal agents, had planted the guns so he could be arrested. He denied telling [Department of Public Safety agent] Pagel he carried a gun. Below, in a KDFW-TV interview in 1982, Charles Harrelson back tracks somewhat on his claims of killing Kennedy   but does point directly to a larger conspiracy concerning the US government s involvement in the death of Kennedy as well as their alleged link to drug trade in America.The interview is a startling revelation, adding to the enigmatic JFK mystery and in the process   provides another strange backdrop to NBK Do you believe Lee Harvey Oswald killed President Kennedy alone   We ll get back to that   alone, without any aid from a rogue agency of the US government or at least a portion of that agency? I believe your very naive if you do.    Charles HarrelsonOn Independence Day in 1995, Charles along with two other inmates, Gary Settle and Michael Rivers, tried to escape from Atlanta Federal Penitentiary   later surrendering after warning shots were fired by guards.  ENTROPY & ECSTASY  - NBK s mass murder mayhem hits prime time TV.Fragmented Psyche, the Death Drive & Mind ControlWhen exploring the concept of Sigmund Freud s Death Drive and its relation to NBK, we should consider a thoughtful essay by Jon Mills entitled  Reflections on the Death Drive.  Here we can gain a better understanding of the tension at play within the psyche of Mickey and Mallory: Freud did not argue that death [thantos] was the only aim of life, only that it maintained a dialectical tension in juxtaposition to a life principle under the ancient command of Eros, yet the two forces of mind remained ontologically inseparable. In this relational age, the death drive appears to be a drowning man. Through this analysis, we can see the tug of war within the main characters of NBK   caught within a life and death cycle.Also observed throughout the nonlinear narrative of NBK, are the media mobs and throngs of onlookers mesmerized by the murderous duo s violent deeds during the course of the film, arguably revealing a Schadenfreude (joy derived from the misfortune of others).In essence, the abused become the abusers within the fragmented framework of NBK. This twist to the story pushes the observer into accepting and perhaps identifying with the malevolent turn of the Knoxes because of their own flawed and tragic upbringing. This reality is recognized in the rise against perceived corruption (particularly law enforcement) in the form of social justice group think.However, this is where the film purposely presents a false paradigm to those subconsciously seeking their own radical retribution   something which further fractures the viewer s perception by utilizing stereotypical patterns or in this case violent molds to excuse the rampage carried out by Mickey and Mallory Knox.This type of false paradigm forms a preconditioned response in favor of vigilantism; preventing the viewer s ability to see things in an unbiased way, which induces a type of cognitive dissonance in passive audiences, blocking one from considering a rational outlook in the aftermath of trauma.These concepts are central to understanding the nature of NBK, as it stirs questions about morality, societal behavior and the role played by both media and the public in an ongoing celebration of violence. In this sense, we can view NBK s excessive use of trauma-based imagery as statement about the modern age, a culture perpetually inundated by destructive media programming.In many ways, mind control abuse is heavily present within the topsy-turvy world of NBK. However, its presence in the film should be seen not necessarily as an indoctrination of the viewer but perhaps as a warning to those unaware of the psychic assault on their senses from all kinds of media.The film is laced with references to Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), conjuring the CIA s mind-warping military backed program, MK-Ultra, an illegal project that used hypnosis, sensory deprivation and other forms of torture to coerce an individual psychologically. This is represented in the film s main characters, as they vacillate between periods of ultra-violent behaviour and delusional wishful daydreaming, something which reflects a complex background of abuse.Here s an in-depth ABC news documentary examining Project MK-Ultra and the role played by Scottish-American psychiatrist Donald Ewen Cameron The heart of MK-Ultra is also seen in the controversial paper entitled From PSYOP to MindWar: The Psychology of Victory , written in part by the avowed satanist Michael Aquino, a high ranking security official, who was stated to have been inspired by Lieutenant Colonel John Alexander s article on  pyschotronics,  the employment of extrasensory perception, the transmission and reception of information via the mind.NBK s use of disturbing content might be best understood through its critique of mass media and the larger role that media has played in forcing trauma-based imagery on the public in a manner similar to that of covert military projects. In other words, NBK s volatile imagery is meant to be a savage attack on media itself and should be observed as a critique on media abuse as a whole   not something that overtly supports cruelty.Other aspects of abuse are also present in NBK, whether it s Mallory s unseen abuse by her father Ed, the hostage held captive by the psychotic pair at the  Lodge  motel or Scagnetti s deranged and vile coping mechanism for his own tragic upbringing.Towards the end of the film, under a Stockholm Syndrome spell, crack reporter Gale, attempts to transform himself for the sake of Mickey and Mallory. This later leads to his demise, when he discovers he s not truly a natural born killer. We see the camera capture the action  to tell the tale  of Mickey and Mallory one more time. In the film s final surreal sequence, we see Mickey and Mallory driving in an RV as parents. The idea here is that the Knoxes represent a future society, a future nuclear family, one without traditional moral values, transformed by the death of American culture. This is something which is echoed by Leonard Cohen s song The Future at the end of the film.  PRISON BREAK    Mickey waxes poetic until a prison riot is sparked after talking to Gale. During the prison scene, Stone enlisted some 200 hardened criminals for the realistic riot scene.Cult Crimes & The Daily ShooterWhen concerning America s cult crimes, investigative journalist Maury Terry, and his book The Ultimate Evil, comes to mind. Winding down a dark and treacherous path, Terry s research uncovered the dark details about the so-called Helter Skelter killings, also known as the Tate-LaBianca murders, the  Son of Sam  shootings and other bizarre ritually crafted murders cascading across America from the 1960 s throughout the 1980 s.In an article published by Los Angeles Magazine, writer Michael Bendrix, discussed Terry s controversial book and the  web of terror  surrounding the apparent satanic ritual abuse (SRA) cult cases connected from coast to coast: Although Manson and David Berkowitz never knew each other, they both belonged at different times and on different coasts to the same umbrella satanic-cult organization, called the Process. The Process Church s dark history (splintered off from Scientology), also recalls the Temple of Set church, a reboot of Anton Levay s Church of Satan, as well as Jim Jones and the People s Temple. Interestingly, Jones  friend Dan Mitrione, was an operative trained in  advanced counterinsurgency techniques,  working with both the FBI and CIA, adding to the prevailing mystery of the Brian Jonestown massacre.According to the researcher John Judge, Jones, once a poor preacher, started People s Temple after meeting Mitrione. Judge uncovered much of the media manipulation in the aftermath of the Brian Jonestown massacre. Much of which, was used to besiege the American public through a distortion of facts   something that we see reflected in many high profile cases today.In the arresting book Programmed to Kill by writer and researcher David McGowan, we see an examination of the American media and government agency propelled serial killer saga in a chapter entitled The Myth of the Serial Killer. Here is a passage that directly relates to the narrative of NBK and in some cases, crimes occurring in America today: Most Americans are probably familiar with what is considered the classic serial killer  profile.  This was a notion first put forth by the venerable FBI, which coined the term  serial killer,  and pioneered the concept of  profiling,  in an alleged attempt to understand the phenomenon of mass murder. It appears to be the case though the concept of the  serial killer profile  was put forth largely to misinform the public. In the case of Henry Lee Lucas, few if any of the elements of the serial killer profile apply. For instance, serial killers are said to act alone, driven to do so only by their own private demons. So far removed from ordinary behavior are their actions that they would not, indeed could not, share their private passions with others. In Henry s case, this is a patently false notion. It has been officially acknowledged that Lucas worked with not just one, but at times as many as three accomplices Later, McGowan links the CIA s politically motivated counter-insurgency campaign within Vietnam (Operation Phoenix) to a domestic version (Operation CHAOS) of terror, featuring serial killings throughout the 1960 s, in order to create a climate of fear to push for a police state crackdown.The CIA s Operation CHAOS  collected substantial amounts of information on domestic dissidents from 1967 to 1973,  as admitted by the CIA.Over 40 years ago, a horrific crime spree took place sometime between 1972 -1974 that was dubbed the Zebra Murders. It was a shocking crime spree that shook the San Francisco area to the core.The murders were supposedly refered to as  Zebra , because the radio communications channel that police talked over was channel Z. Reportedly, four Black Muslim men calling themselves the  Death Angels were spawned from a known cointelpro hangout, Nation of Islam.The Death Angels were said to have shot future Mayor of San Francisco Art Angos. Some researchers on the subject have suggested that the Death Angels were trained counter-intelligence assassins tasked with fomenting a race war in America.In the 1990 s the idea of the  lone  serial killer phenomena faded into the background, exploding with the revamped media-driven image of the mass murder around every tabloid corner. When the decade came to a close, tabloid news produced the ratings that networks like ABC, CBS and NBC were starving for. The news world changed after the O. J. Simpson trial, opening the door for larger outlets to run the type of sensational TV programming previously reserved for popular shows like A Current Affair, Hard Copy and Inside Edition   everything from salacious  soft feature  celebrity pieces, to murder stories and courtroom dramas such as Divorce Court and Judge Judy seeped into regular television fair.Similarly in the world today, the public has become reprogrammed by the fear-based odyssey of the  War On Terror  era and in more recent happenings such as the barrage of Daily Shooter mass casualty incidents rippling across America and Europe in the form of Gladio-style operations, we see another phase in the assault on reality. These cases have risen to the forefront in media as there is only a passing footnote concerned about serial killings, largely due to the public s desensitization.This new kind of  crimescape  injects the collective hive mind with a host of socio-political concerns over race, religion, reform and security, while obscuring the forensic synopsis of a crime itself.The notion that serial killers have in fact not acted alone under the  lone wolf  banner, coincides with findings about many of today s mass-shooters, who in a number of cases covered here at 21WIRE, have involved multiple suspects, actors and drills. Most recently in America, the events surrounding the Orlando Pulse night club were called into question, as eye-witness accounts suggested multiple suspects in the alleged lone wolf attack and that the authorities themselves may be to blame for some of the apparent deaths.Additionally, back in 2013, the alleged Pulse nightclub shooter Omar Mateen, was placed under a terror watch list for 10 months (interviewed three times by the FBI between 2013-14) having worked for one of the largest security firms (G4S Secure Solutions, headquartered in Jupiter, Florida) in the US and around the world since 2007. The firm was formerly part of a CIA-linked government contractor and security firm, Wackenhut Corporation. Mateen s extensive background with G4S, reveals another yet another curious connection between security and terror.When discussing the mass shooter phenomena as it relates to terror and security, writer and researcher Jay Dyer of Jay s Analysis, stated the following: The purpose of organized black op events is the psychological warfare effect of mass shootings.  All warfare is psychological warfare, as the intent of the attacking party or army desires to bring about the acquiescence of the enemy. Warfare itself is merely a tool to bring about the psychological submission of the other side, while the intention of wiping out the enemy forces are secondary.  Why deplete one s own forces and resources if the enemy can be molded to think accordingly? In this sense, terrorism is the purposeful display of chaos and fear that arises from the radical disturbance of the normal, daily patterns and social routines of the enemy with the intent of achieving an alteration in the psyche of the target populace. Indeed, as critical pieces of Daily Shooter events come together  evidence often suggests a highly organized and coordinated event involving many players. Those players then craft the three dimensions of how we are to view the event   carrying out the event are as follows: members of the police and security services, and most crucially, members of the global media. The last and most important group provides the fourth dimension of this reality, and that is you the public.How you view any questionable event   is the pinnacle for the architects of any impressive psy-op.A fifth dimension is based on the fourth, which is how the architects and social engineers observe your reactions to the event. From this, data is collected, social media is monitored, then metered, opinions are analyzed, and public reactions are measured. The conclusions will be used to form the baseline and design of future  shock and awe  operations reacting directly to the public s response.  CASTING CRISIS    Media fed madness hits the front page.Reality RebornIn an exploratory essay entitled  Critical Theories of Mass Media: Then and Now,  written by Paul A. Taylor and Jan Ll. Harris, we can see clearer role of NBK and how it relates to the modern era: The  shock  of the modern urban environment is figured in terms of a welter of new micro-perceptions, disorientating cuts and contingent images a realm of experience that also characterizes the cinematic experience. Cinema thus trains the sensorium and helps the subject adapt to this new technological social reality. While NBK covers some dark and sometimes philosophical territory, it often hints at something much darker than our imaginations can comprehend. In this sense, the viewer feels like a guilty voyeur in a culture of violence, reliving trauma gratuitously through the callous and obsessive lens of mass media.In the past critics and media have accused NBK itself of giving rise to  copycat  crimes as well as the Columbine High School massacre, and the Dunblane massacre. But interestingly, these two high profile shootings from the 1990 s have a number of questionable elements forensically, such as conflicting eyewitness testimony and how they were apparently carried out.NBK can be thought of as an ultra or hyper-reality, an unreality more real than reality. While critics of the film cite NBK s dangerous content and presentation, it employs a heavy dose of artificial reality in order to inject certain universal truths about the nature of man and media. In an article for Ceasefire magazine, Andrew Robinson deconstructs Jean Baudrillard s hyper-reality. A concept prominently observed while watching NBK: Hyperreality is a special kind of social reality in which a reality is created or simulated from models, or defined by reference to models   a reality generated from ideas. The term has implications of  too much reality    everything being on the surface, without mystery;  more real than reality    too perfect and schematic to be true, like special effects; and  para-reality , an extra layer laid over, or instead of, reality. It is experienced as more real than the real, because of its effect of breaking down the boundary between real and imaginary. It is a  real  without  origin or reality , a reality to which we cannot connect. In an informative piece by Randy Laist, Ph. D., entitled,  Murder and Montage: Oliver Stone s Hyperreal Period,  we see a complex blended reality at play during NBK: Mickey and Mallory are the icons of the new reality: the image ripped out of its context, the innocent killer, the fictional character roaming free across the video prairies of the new manmade nature.  Natural Born Killers elicits our own complicity with the cultural tendency it satirizes, blending critique with enactment in a way that collapses the border between character and audience as well as between moralistic valuations of guilt and innocence. In this perpetual age of terror, highly sophisticated methods are used to alter, distort and reform the public mind. NBK was able to pull back the curtain on mass media s scripted reign READ MORE ALTERNATIVE HOLLYWOOD NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Hollywood Files",Middle-east,"August 13, 2016"

In this latest episode of the Daily Shooter, local law enforcement in Punta Gorda, Florida, accidentally use live rounds and fatally shoot an innocent woman participating in a so-called  shoot/don t shoot  scenario   where a police officer plays the role of the  bad guy  and the unsuspecting woman the victim.

23292,PROPAGANDA: Star Trek Beyond – Social Justice Warriors in Space,"Jay Dyer 21st Century WireThe last Star Trek reboot saw Benedict Cumberbatch as Kahn, the berserk super soldier who was angry about the  Federation  doing some such nefarious thing to his people group.  This installment  included curious references to false flags which I detailed here.Before that, in the initial reboot, there was an angry alien who attacked the Federation over his tribal group being shat upon (or, Shatnered upon!).  So, for the third time in a row, we have roughly the same plot of dispossessed discontent tribalists and unique people groups who become terrorists when their way of life is encroached upon by the United Nations, er, NATO, er, New World Order, er Federation.We have seen this pattern often in the Star Trek, but in the recent installment, it s even more pronounced as we discover the character Sulu is gay.  Indeed, trans-specism and the destruction of people groups under liberal tyranny has always been the worldview of Star Trek   Gene Roddenberry was a rabidly atheistic globalist (or, as an even darker possibility, was Roddenberry a member of an occultic group known as  The Nine, ?).There is some interesting evidence connecting Roddenberry (connected to the Esalen Institute  which I covered here) to esoteric groups, mind control and the Rand Corporation.  This would explain the many gnostic, scientistic, platonic and at times interestingly philosophical episodes, in the original series and its Next Generation successor.Secret Sun blog explains: So if you were hawking a sci-fi religion, who better to approach than the creator of the sci-fi sensation of the early/mid 70s? From 2008:In early 1975, a broke and depressed Roddenberry was approached by a British former race car driver named Sir John Whitmore, who was associated with a strange organization called  Lab-9.  Though unknown to the public, Lab-9 were ostensibly a sort of an independent version of the X-Files, dedicated to the research of paranormal phenomena. However, Lab-9 had another, more complex agenda- they later claimed to be in contact with a group of extraterrestrials called the  Council of Nine Lab-9 had wanted to hire Roddenberry to write a screenplay based on the Council of Nine s imminent return .Lab-9 flew him out to their headquarters, located on a large estate in Ossining, NY. There, Roddenberry met and interviewed several psychics, and prepared the groundwork for his script.Roddenberry wrote a script called The Nine, in which he fictionalized his experiences at Lab-9 and the message for humanity that the Council of Nine wished to convey Beam me up, RAND!(T)his was no ragtag bunch of hippie phreaks that Roddenberry was dealing with Roddenberry biographer Joel Engel noted that Whitmore introduced Roddenberry to several key figures in the British Broadcasting Corp. as well.  In regard to the connection to RAND, Opsecnews states:According to the TrekPlace website Harvey P. Lynn, Jr. (?-1987), a member of the prestigious RAND Corporation, provided Star Trek original series creator Gene Roddenberry with scientific and technical advice during preproduction of the series.On the Rand Corporation s website the question is asked whether a RAND researcher designed the initial bridge of the Enterprise. The answer given is,  A Rand researcher, Harvey Lynn, was consulted, but as a private citizen, not as part of a RAND project. However in an interview from 1965 Jeffrey Hunter, who played captain Christopher Pike in the Star Trek pilot  The Cage  and preceded William Shatner as first captain of the Enterprise stated,  The things that intrigues me the most is that it is actually based on the Rand Corporation s projection of things to come. Except for the fictional characters, it will be like getting a look into the future and some of the predictions will surely come true in our lifetime. The inherent contradiction that Star Trek continually demonstrates is the contradiction of the liberal philosophy   and I mean in this in the classically liberal sense, that radical egalitarianism and atomistic individualism creates a horrid collective gathered around nothing more than liberalism itself.  In this way, liberalism and its epistemic and cultural relativism can only allow for itself, and must destroy and exclude all other options, including even non-liberal democracy.In numerous Star Trek episodes, we even see the  Prime Directive  of the Federation s commitment to not violating an existing culture violated under the pretended facade of liberal  rights  and values.   Western NGOs and foundations fulfill this very role today, with a cover of aiding the downtrodden, while secretly working for western political ends, as we see in the Soros-funded  White Helmets scam. (If anyone doubts RAND connections to Hollywood, let s not forget the 2014 faux scandal of The Interview). Ironically, the new film demonstrates this toxic cultural imperialism explicitly.  GlobalResearch explains: Aside from not addressing the darker side of US foreign policy, Hollywood movies like Forrest Gump carry subliminal messages. In the words of the US culture and entertainment magazine Rolling Stone:  The message of Forrest Gump was that if you think about the hard stuff too much, you ll either get AIDS or lose your legs. Meanwhile, the hero is the idiot who just shrugs and says  Whatever! whenever his country asks him to do something crazy.  What Rolling Stone is saying that listen to what you are commanded to do.Then there are movies like American Sniper that collapse US foreign policy into the simplistic notion of individual characters. What this does is collapse the event and the soldiers into one, which means that if ones criticize a US war that you are attacking the soldiers and their convictions. This is hiding behind the soldiers and detracting from the real issue of an illegal invasion and occupation. Nor is there any mention of Abu Ghraib or the false weapons of mass destruction lies. Rolling Stone had this to say about American Sniper:  Sniper is a movie whose politics are so ludicrous and idiotic that under normal circumstances it would be beneath criticism. The only thing that forces us to take it seriously is the extraordinary fact that an almost exactly similar worldview consumed the walnut-sized mind of the president who got us into the war in question. It s the fact that the movie is popular, and actually makes sense to so many people, that s the problem,  it also adds. In fact, as a result of the movie there was an increase in hate crimes in the US and negative feelings towards Arabs and Muslims. I was tempted to draw up an elaborate analysis of symbols and deeper meanings, but depth was absent in this film.  Other than an odd similarity between the  terrorist  character as a former soldier who went mad from radicalism (traditionalism!) being similar to the D.C.  sniper  event, Admiral Krall is merely a representation of any cultures or people groups who want a more traditional, organic existence and reject the Federation s globalism.  As such, they are  terrorists  who are impelled by their fury and insanity to bomb the glorious, multi-cultural megalopolis space city Yorktown.  In other words, all groups that aren t on board with globalism and liberal, inverted monoculture are terrists destined to attack New York.Krall thus represents the life-extension inherent in the damned traditionalism that will not die in the face of globalism.  Krall is a grotesque icon of the film s view of patriarchal, honor-based societies as a perpetual reptilian madness that humans must evolve beyond.  If you don t accept homo-mono-globo-liberalism, you are a terrorist that will unleash bioweapons in New York.The Holy United Nations and the space brothers have told the Pentagon humanity must evolve beyond distinctions and borders, and Gene and the pope are is its prophets. By the way   if the citizens of the multi cultural Yorktown space station can beam about at will, why didn t they just beam Admiral Krall into space when he had the bio weapon?Oops! #StarCuck #captainJamesTKuckREAD MORE HOLLYWOOD NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Hollywood FilesTo hear Jay s full podcasts, see more information and learn how you can become a subscriber to JaysAnalysis.Jay Dyer is the author of the forthcoming title, Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults and Symbols in Film from Trine Day.

23293,"PAY 2 PLAY: Democratic Convention Ends Amid Controversy, Empty Seats & White Noise","Shawn Helton 21st Century WireThe 2016 Democratic National Convention was the latest in a long line of sordid political productions  It was a tough week for the Clinton  change makers  as Bernie Sanders delegates staged a mass walkout after a series of email leaks disclosed that a Clinton lawyer gave the DNC strategy advice on how to sideline the Sanders campaign.There were also claims of white noise machines used to quell any anti-Clinton dissent inside the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. Help Wanted: Actors Needed Putting aside the fact that today s US presidential conventions have turned into celebrity show business promotional events (pop star Katie Perry, Ted Danson, and even British actor Orlando Bloom et all), there s another more disturbing controversy emerging   this time over a Craigslist ad stating that,  actors were needed for a national convention    prompting critics to suggest empty seats had to be filled prior to the end of the convention and that the July 27th ad was at the behest of the DNC.Whether or not all or some of the claims above are fully accurate, 2016 s DNC was unquestionably a contentious affair filled with a heavy dose of identity politics.In fact, the star-studded event conjured the bizarre Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting from just over a month ago by having Christine Leinonen speak at the convention, a former Michigan State Police trooper/Florida Attorney turned Wheel of Fortune hopeful, and mother of Christopher (Drew) Leinonen, an apparent victim of America s largest mass shooting. Here s Australia s Peekay Truth on YouTube examining the phenomena surrounding Christine Leinonen Interestingly, Chris Leinonen s pro gun father Mark Bando, a former patrol officer for the city of Detroit PD from 1974-99, did not speak at the convention on behalf of his son.Additionally at Leinonen s speech at the DNC, she was accompanied by Pulse nightclub shooting survivor Brandon Wolf, who just happens to be a former runner-up on Bravo TV s The Kandi Factory. We ve noted before, the many strange Hollywood links to the Pulse shooting, including the apparent actor-cum-shooter Omar Mateen.Below is a YouTube video from the user Run2Christ HD, which investigates the many casting connections linked to Brandon Wolf, while also disclosing that one of the Pulse nightclub founders, Ron Legler, is the president of the Florida Theatrical Association and a booking agent for national touring broadway productions. Some of FTA s productions include The Lion King, Chicago and The Phantom of the Opera.Here s Brandon Wolf ready for his close-up Here s a screen shot of Ron Legler s professional background Here at 21WIRE, we examined much of the anomalies associated with the Orlando shooting, an event that failed to account for any shootings said to have taken place within the nightclub, as the FBI s own transcript made no mention of individuals being shot inside the club.If you remember, according to FOX analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano plainly states that all of the Pulse nightclub victims met their fate when Orlando police entered the building Here s a You Tube video montage from Educate Yourself, that displays some of the strange behaviour exhibited by Christine Leinonen More DNC discussion from Zero Hedge below DNC NIGHTMARE?    Empty seats observed during roll call at the DNC. (Image Source: fellowshipofminds)Zero HedgeDid The DNC Hire Actors (At Below Minimum Wage) To Work At The Convention?Following the exposure of a fake Trump job advertisement designed by The DNC to embarrass Trump, it is interesting that a Craigslist ad calling for  Actors Needed for National Convention  has surfaced Whether the ad is real or fake is unclear, but the text suggests below minimum wage compensation (7-plus hours work for $50) and the number of walkouts from the Convention indicates perhaps a need for cheering happy seat-fillers SNOOZEFEST    Bill Clinton nods off during Hillary s vacuous speech. (Image Source: YouTube)Actors Needed For National Convention (Philadelphia) compensation: $50.00 Looking for 700 people to be utilized as actors during the National Convention. We currently have a number of empty seats that will need to be filled as we are currently removing a number of people and need to refill their seats for the remainder of the conference. You will be paid $50.00 each night for the remainder of the convention. You will be required to cheer at all times and will be asked to dress properly and possibly wear some promotional material.Which makes sense if one looks at the following shocking video from film director, Josh Fox, best known for his Oscar-nominated anti-fracking documentary Gasland, captured inside the DNC As DailyWire.com reports, Fox tells the camera   This is amazing, this place is empty. There is nobody left in here. I mean this whole stadium, look at this,  as he pans his cellphone to show the lack of cheering Dems.He continues in disbelief, adding,  This is not voter enthusiasm . I can t believe my eyes. I ve never seen anything like this. This is the primetime of the Democratic National Convention right after the nomination of Hillary Clinton and this place is emptied out like crazy. I m stunned. This is insane. The whole California delegation is pretty much gone,  he adds.  I mean this has got to be something very worrisome for the Democrats. Voter enthusiasm wins elections.

23296,‘STRANGER THINGS’ – Hollywood MK Ultra Goes Full Occult,"Jay Dyer 21st Century WireThe popular 80s pastiche series Stranger Things begins with a familiar scene of E.T. nostalgia, centering around Dungeons & Dragons. The scene is particularly familiar to me, since I played D&D back in the day, but learned very quickly this nefarious practice was like kryptonite to all things female.  Oddly enough, the series appears to reflect a new trend amongst Hollywood A-listers, where nerd culture has revived the ancient 80s practice of playing D&D.  The Hollywood Reporter explains the trend and its connection to acting and role-playing: Vin Diesel plays it. So do Dwayne Johnson, Drew Barrymore, Stephen Colbert, Mike Myers and Jon Favreau, among other bold-face names. Some even built their careers by playing it The decades-old role-playing game   in which participants roll multisided dice while pretending to be mystical creatures such as elves and dwarves   finally is coming out of the closet (or, in this case, Mom s basement).  There s a huge resurgence of nerd culture, especially with the tech boom,  says Silicon Valley s Martin Starr, a longtime D&D enthusiast.  If nerds were still poor and living at their mothers , nobody would be paying any attention to Dungeons & Dragons. But nerds rule the world, and D&D is making a big comeback   and I m excited about it. While this certainly relates to a furtherance of one s improv skills, it also relates to the occult side of Hollywood, though I don t take the ridiculous evangelical view that D&D is inherently evil.  Rather, the notion of role-playing is synonymous with the ancient view of acting as dramaturgy, or ritual invocation of the gods.  Comparative religion scholar Dudley Young writes: The earliest gods were invoked by ritual act (dromenon = the thing done) such as a sacrificial dance, commemorating the fact that our life begins and ends when they call upon us.  Subsequently the thing was said (legomenon) as well as done, and the dromenon was on its way to becoming the drama.  Once speech within the temple precincts has been endowed with the power of word-magic, we have  the invocation  properly so called.  (Dudley Young, Origins of the Sacred: The Ecstasies of Love and War, pg. 413)Set in the fictional small town of Hawkins, Indiana in 1983, we will see the accidental dramaturgical invocation where the D&D simulacrum appears to actually be related on a deeper level to the occult phenomena that begin to occur.  The disappearance of young Will Byers sparks a series of events that take Hawkins down a black rabbit hole of every conspiracy theory ever, melded with the opening of the inter-dimensional gates from every John Carpenter film. Originally slated to be titled  Montauk,  the series echoes the dubious accounts of Project Montauk, where purportedly time and space were altered in government-sponsored PsyOps and time travel  experiments with famed UFO researcher Jacques Vallee commenting the experiments were related to the Philadelphia Experiment.  For more information and speculation on this topic, I interviewed Dr. Farrell on his views here.D & D invokes the entities in E.T.. The stories of Montauk appear to originate in a book series by Preston Nichols, who claims to have discovered  repressed memories  of the event.  This laughable scenario immediately smacks of PsyOps, making the original connection to large-scale deception all the more appropriate.  Even Vallee alleges the  experiment is a hoax, suggesting an experiment in seeing what you can get people to believe, as opposed to some real space-time warping experiment. Vallee writes: I hypothesized that the experiments had to do with a radar countermeasures test. Indeed a Raytheon advertisement published thirteen years ago suggested that the corresponding technology was now out in the open (Raytheon, 1980). This hypothesis, however, failed to explain a few of the facts that highlighted the story. In particular it did not account for the observed disappearance of the destroyer from the harbor, for the mysterious devices brought on board under extreme security precautions, or for the alleged disappearance of two sailors from a nearby tavern. While it may be the case that the Navy altered space-time, does Vallee not consider the possibility this is all bullshit, as so many  military whistleblowers  and  generals  so often  leak ?  Rather, as is so often the case, all the  evidence  for these events relies on some retired Navy man with all the credentials of the Navy man from the Village People. This is also why the Montauk tale mixes aliens and other nonsense in with the notion of the Apollo Mission being staged   disinformation.  Vallee himself was a high up government operator with an interest in occultism and Rosicrucianism, and is represented in Spielberg s Close Encounters by the character of Claude Lacombe (played by Francois Truffaut).Through the dimensional gate: the Demogorgon saps energy and hatches incubus style demon-babies in Ridley Scott form. .Thus, all of this functions as the spirit behind Stranger Things, as well as myriad other influences, such as Star Wars, Alien, Goonies, H.P. Lovecraft, Evil Dead, X-Men, Stephen King, and John Carpenter.  That said, I consider the series as accurately showing some aspects of the spiritual realm, couched in scientistic mysticism, where our initial suspicion of extra-terrestrial alien manipulation is revealed to be both terrestrial and demonic.  The Demogorgon inhabits a realm that is the  upside down,  the negative or demonic dark side of our world, which matches up to the Kabbalistic notion of the Qilphoth or the Abyss of Da at at times, as Crowley claims: This doctrine is extremely difficult to explain; but it corresponds more or less to the gap in thought between the Real, which is ideal, and the Unreal, which is actual. In the Abyss all things exist, indeed, at least in posse, but are without any possible meaning; for they lack the substratum of spiritual Reality. They are appearances without Law. They are thus Insane Delusions  Now the Abyss being thus the great storehouse of Phenomena, it is the source of all impressions. Spoiler alert, but the missing children are not only part of MK Ultra, but are being used in top-secret testing that includes LSD, sensory deprivation and the development of Men Who Stare at Goats (or Kids Who Stare at Kittens)-type mental powers.  Interestingly, the abducted super-soldier kid named  11  and  El  is specifically told to kill a kitten which is rumored to be an aspect of trauma-based mind control.  Basically, all the rumors of hardcore child abuse and mind control are rolled into the series with the character  El,  who is able to remote view the spiritual realm and spy on Soviets (as well as Demogorgons).Like the simulacrum in Spielberg films, the spirits communicate across the void through the Kabbalistic principle of esoteric symbology and linguistics, as I showed in my Close Encounters analysis.. Oblivious to the dangers of such programs, Mr. Man in Black Shadow Government from the Dept. of Energy persists in hunting down his escaped  daughter  El (hinting at sexual abuse), who finds her way into the Goonies gang of Mike, Will and Lucas (I m assuming you ve seen it).  Most interesting is the biblical and occult notion of the opening of  gates  through such  scientific  experiments, which are in fact occult rituals involving child adduction and sacrifice under the guise of  cancer  research (MK Ultra).  Could this be a hint at what the cancer complex is really involved in?  Genetic and psychological experimentation with children for the  greater good ?  Certainly there have been numerous cases of missing children in the US, as well as small towns experimented on by the shadow government.  It would seem that Stanger Things is obliquely referencing these themes, as well as the possibility of actual murders and abductions, as author William Ramsey argues here.Given blood and sacrifice bring the demon and open the gate, we can assume the references are to the goetia, where demons are invoked through sigils. . Two notions that occurred to me I have not seen tacked yet in the series is the strange reference to the loss of  father  and  God,  as we see no strong male figures.  Hop the cop, like a horny rabbit, hops from girl to girl having lost his daughter, while Will s father is a deadbeat.  In Mike and Nancy s household, the ineffectual, sterile father character of Mr. Wheeler remains ever clueless while arguing to Mrs. Wheeler the  government is on our side,  and would never lie.Set in the Cold War, the fear and panic of the ridiculous  Russian Threat  in the background of the series allows the shadow state to develop the explicitly-named Star Wars Defense Program, where  lasers and space weapons  are being made to destroy the  Russkies.  Amazingly accurate in this insight, this is a point JaysAnalysis has been highlighting the last few years with the hype of the Cold War deception allowing for the rise of the dark military industrial complex which seems to have a penchant for human sacrifice.  Note that I have argued many times that Mk Ultra was not merely a mind control experiment, but was about the entire biosphere, under the Department of Energy.Cop Hop discovers the advanced weapons lab facility is involved in MK Ultra   something I have discussed many times. . The sacrifice of the youth for the dark designs of the shadow government is the ultimate conspiracy in the series, but what is more remarkable than this is the explanation by the Man in Black Dr. Brenner (Matthew Modine) that the sacrifice of sons and daughters for the gorgodemon is for the good of America.  In other words, we are given the impression our villain knows the real source of the dark power in Hawkins, the demonic, and that the sacrifice of humans and blood draws it nearer and nearer.  Foolishly assuming this dark energy can be harnessed for U.S. supremacy, Dr. Brenner is behind both MK Ultra and the SDI program that requires the sacrifice of America s  sons and daughters !  This spiritual dimension is the accurate and insightful aspect of the series, but the message is not all good.Dr. Brenner demands more demonic channeling from El. Note her similarity of appearance to the Princess in The Never Ending Story..  The flip side, as mentioned, is that El as an androgynous, yet dominantly feminine archetype, is a form of the incarnation of the goddess.  We have seen this of late in pop fiction more times than I can count, in examples like Hanna, Hunger Games, Lucy, Ex Machina and Jupiter Ascending, where the gnostic perspective of exalting the opposing force to the male is assumed to bring a cosmically needed  balance to the war hawk patriarchy.  A perennial myth of liberal fantasies, the feminist archetype will in no way bring peace and balance, only more destruction as gender roles continue to be confused.  Feminism is part of that very destruction, and the fact that El shouts out in the aether  God,   Dad  and  Gone,  suggests her association with Dr. Brenner as her  dad  and Father God s lack of answer to her call, means the solution to the spiritual problems of man can be found in a Luciferian evolution of humans beyond the  traps  of gender and evil patriarchal deities.  In occultist Edmund Spenser s Faerie Queen, we read:Downe in the bottome of the deepe Abysse Where Demogorgon in dull darknesse pent, Farre from the view of Gods and heauens blis, The hideous Chaos keepes, their dreadfull dwelling is.   (Book IV, Canto ii, stanza 47)In the process of becoming cruciform, the sacred feminine pistis Sophia incarnate destroys the patriarchal  non-God. .  Indeed, El annihilates the cruciform Demogorgon as if it were a demiurge that has imprisoned the town spiritually.  This is precisely the Luciferian view   Jesus and/or God the Father are demiurges who have imprisoned humans in this dimension and sap their energy as vampires, requiring blood sacrifice.  Of course, none of that is true, as the Logos is the salvation of the human race, reconciling them to God by becoming Incarnate and destroying Death.  In the gnostic scheme the roles are reversed, where El becomes the Luciferian dark hero rescuing the town through her sacrifice to destroy the cruciform demon-god.  And, as you probably guessed, that is why her name is  El,  recalling the old Canaanite term for the gods who warred against Jehovah in the Bible.  In fact, the Demogorgon is generally traced back to the demiurge.The series also uses numerology frequently, such as  11  and  77  suggesting the demonology of Crowley and references to 9/11 as a ritual initiation.  Interestingly, light is mentioned several times in the series as both a means of communication and symbol of enlightenment.  As you can see in the above image,  photosynthesis  is placed behind El as she dissolves the Demogorgon, suggesting the dissolution of Traditional Religion by  enlightenment,  perfectly consonant with the message of Gnosticism and Luciferianism.The gateways have been opened through mass human sacrifice of America s sons and daughters   the  new man  is a dark, half-androgynous goddess who will destroy the  genocidal  patriarchal religions and bring a new Amerikan aeon of the crowned and conquering girl-child, a Luciferian world order.READ MORE HOLLYWOOD NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Hollywood FilesTo hear Jay s full podcasts, see more information and learn how you can become a subscriber to JaysAnalysis.Jay Dyer is the author of the forthcoming title, Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults and Symbols in Film from Trine Day.

23302,US-UK DIRTY WAR: ‘Latin American-style’ Death Squads in Iraq Revealed Through Chilcot," Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireThis week another toxic revelation dripped from the Chilcot Report.According to top British SAS officers, US commander Stanley McChrystal s counter-insurgency  black-ops  featured a program of relentless violence designed to  speed up  the process of political cleansing and the so-called  reconstruction  of Iraq.What is so interesting here, is the Chilcot s choice of language, including the term  Latin American-style death squads , which by default implies the United States government was party to war crimes in Central America during the 1980 s   a claim which has always been strenuously denied in public, even though the general public and academia recognizes this to be a self-evident fact of America s long-running ugly history of intervention in that region.The Independent report reveals the level of sheer depravity by US command: The mission was an extraordinary set-up: inside the command centre    The Machine    was the  Death Star , on the walls of which were banks of television screens,  Kill TV , running live pictures of action taking place and surveillance footage in real time from which suspects could be picked out for future arrest or elimination. The Independent also detailed how reckless and violent practices by the US military caused noticeable divisions and splits between joint US-UK command structures and operations, including political tension between British military command.Through the newly created  Office of Special Plans , neoconservatives Paul Wolfowitz and Douglas Feith rolled out their own sub-layer to the US controlled shadow government in Iraq, including the establishment of the  Iraqi De Baathification Council  which, under the supervision of then US Viceroy Paul Bremer, began dismantling the Iraqi military, security and intelligence agency infrastructures of President Saddam Hussein. And so began the process of the Pentagon s  de-Baathification  process in Iraq, immediately followed by a hive of violent  Gangs and Counter-gangs  created by the US and UK covert military and intelligence apparatuses. Front and center in this effort were US operatives John Negroponte and his understudy at the time, Robert Ford, who was later dispatched as US Ambassador to Syria in the run-up to the Syrian Conflict which began in 2011.The legacy of this destructive policy still lingers in Iraq and now in Syria. This unquestionably spawned ISIS and many other terrorist factions in both Iraq and Syria. Only last week, Iraq saw its most deadly car bomb ever, a questionable  sectarian attack  (a narrative not challenged by the western and international press) which killed 200 innocent civilians, and injured many more. GLADIO REDUX: A map of every car bomb in Baghdad since the US-UK invasion in 2003 (Source: Twitter)Prof Michel Chossudovsky explains this same highly disturbing pattern that generally follows every US intervention overseas, be it overt or covert: The recruitment of death squads is part of a well established US military-intelligence agenda. There is a long and gruesome US history of covert funding and support of  terror brigades and targeted assassinations going back to the Vietnam war.   As government forces continue to confront the self-proclaimed  Free Syrian Army  (FSA),  the historical roots of  the West s covert war on Syria  which has resulted in countless atrocities  must be fully revealed.  Once again, we can see the revelation of the US-UK method of not simply instigating wars, but facilitating dirty wars not only overseas, but also at home, as in the case of Operation GLADIO and numerous other false flag events admittedly staged in North America.As 21WIRE will demonstrate in subsequent reports, this latest Chilcot revelation is only the tip of a much larger, covert iceberg RTHowever, kill or capture operations in and around Baghdad, launched from the Balad base 50 miles (80km) north of the city, were a key if little known chapter in Britain s shadow war, the Independent reports.Despite killing or taking as prisoner up to 3,500 insurgents, the mission against the Sunni insurgency caused deep rifts to the point where a senior commander, himself ex-SAS, demanded to know why the UK Special Forces were  helping to run Latin American-style death squads? The mission, under now-famed US General Stanley McChrystal, involved a shift from searching for apparently non-existent weapons of mass destruction (WMD) to man-hunting.Antagonism over the tactics led to UK troops being banned from some operations and a UK SAS commander lodging a complaint with US authorities for talking about British involvement in operations. Another SAS colonel was also ostracized from his regiment after serving under McCrystal.Chilcot does sketch out some of the details of the growing rift, though his report appears to leave out direct references to Special Forces operations. US and UK strategies had, in effect, been on different courses since the UK decision to focus its attention on MND (SE) [Multi-National Division South East, the British run zone] in 2003.As result of this decision, the UK had acquired distinctly different priorities from the US,  the 2.6-million-word report argues.It says the UK was then only  marginally involved in the central tasks of stabilizing the Iraqi government in Baghdad and managing sectarian divisions, while it had come to see its main task in Basra as one of keeping the situation calm while building the case for withdrawal. From that point on, it appears, the US became increasingly concerned that a wavering UK was chiefly focused on getting out of the unpopular war in the best order it could and as soon as possible.In 2006, a former SAS soldier blew the whistle on some of the tactics used in and around Baghdad. Ben Griffin was later gagged by the UK courts for talking about his experiences, but before he was silenced told the Telegraph,  The Americans had this catch-all approach to lifting suspects. The tactics were draconian and completely ineffective. The Americans were doing things like chucking farmers into Abu Ghraib [the notorious prison in Baghdad where US troops abused and tortured Iraqi detainees] or handing them over to the Iraqi authorities, knowing full well they were going to be tortured,  he said at the time.It may be of note that the SAS commander s reference to  Latin American-style deaths squads  appears to ignore the fact that at time of the Iraq war, in July 2003, the UK was itself stepping up training of Colombian paramilitary forces.Commenting on the revelations at the time, human rights NGO Amnesty International warned  the Colombian government has not implemented the UN human rights recommendations and military assistance only gives a green light to the army to carry on as before.

23305,"SCARS & STRIFE: ‘The Purge Election Year’ Agitprop, Change Agents & False Left–Right Statecraft"," Your government thanks you for your participation.    PSA from  The Purge: Election Year Shawn Helton  21st Century Wire A hyper-real vision of America serves as a stark backdrop for Hollywood s social science fiction horror film, The Purge: Election Year.The Purge: Election Year (2016) is the third installment of the  Purge  film franchise, arriving on screen just in time for the hotly contested 2016 presidential election between presumptive nominees Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.The film s recent release also hit theaters prior to a wave of bizarre shootings and street protests now gripping the nation, something which we ll discuss in greater detail later on in this article.The timing of this film s release in relation to current events cannot be overstated, and readers would not be amiss in questioning whether this is merely a coincidence, or if there is a deeper social engineering agenda at play here.  DIVIDE & RULE    Gangs and counter gangs take center stage in  The Purge: Election Year. Election Year s action picks up in 2028, on the eve of the  25th sanctioned purge , where from dusk til dawn (for one day a year on March 21st   22nd), America  purges  itself   suspending state emergency response and police protection as all crime is legalized   including murder.The 12 hour  civic duty  instituted by the cloaked governmental cabal known as the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) is an event enacted after the country plunged into economic ruin and soaring round-the-clock crime rates. The purge is a type of pressure release valve and the NFFA s answer to America s growing desire for class warfare and social decay.Though a more complete background about the true origins of NFFA are scant, there s no doubt the group represents a right-wing political faction on the surface (think neoconservatives on steroids). However, as we ll discover in this often strongly violent, sometimes campy, if not revelatory creation, not everything is entirely as it seems in the powder-keg of this seemingly alternate reality set in a not-too-distant future.Over the course of this analysis, we ll touch on key political aspects observed in the film, while also examining the violent fiction that often bleeds over into reality   NIGHT OF RAGE    A subliminal purging of American history. Understanding The Purge: Election YearThe Purge: Election Year, was written and directed by James DeMonaco, and is full of contradictions.On one hand, the film artificially critiques the violent world cast by NFFA head Caleb Warren (played by actor Raymond J. Barry), while at the same time overlooking the mayhem caused by  anti-purge  revolutionaries seeking social change.In essence, Election Year creates a duplicitous platform which carefully presents only two sides, or choices, for the audience   fascist savagery which is not excused, and social justice savagery which is excusable.This is where Election Year seems to subtly direct the viewer to believe that the  activist  violence depicted in the film is a necessary evil in the pursuit of social justice, when in reality the anti-purge resistance group of leftist radicals (resembling Black Lives Matter and the Black Panthers) led by Dante Bishop (Edwin Hodge), in many ways functions similarly to that of the far-right NFFA   using brute force to carry out its own political and social reform agenda.It should also be noted here that both opposing sides of this political divide will happily deploy (cynically of otherwise) their own violent street mobs to enforce their particular political agenda.Within the framework of this story s rigid political dialectic, and with irreconcilable polar opposite sides at odds, the film appears to be making another point: that civil war is not only inevitable, it s necessary in order for the political and social  evolution  to take place.   ANTI-PURGE-PANTHERS    A pivotal scene where anti-purge leader Dante Bishop seeks to assassinate NFFA rulers. Although the film appears to reflect some emerging aspects of today s real politik, there is an underlying political perspective that isn t often discussed present in the film. Think of the merging neoliberal and neoconservative factions in real-life politics, where many fascist views and radical ideologies have become blurred, with the popular 20th century left-wing ideology rooted in its connection to Leon Trotsky s theory of Marxism called Trotskyism   a theory where world-wide socialism is achieved only through ongoing revolution.Going back to Election Year, we know that the NFFA s  evolution/revolution  overthrew the United States government as an answer to many social ills and in a similar way  anti-purge  rebels are seeking to disband the NFFA in favor of their own system of social justice.Although not addressed by the film s writers, acknowledging political reality should leave viewers with another fundamental question: how long before the anti-purge rebels take the place of the NFFA as the next Junta?Let s rewind for a moment, and briefly review Election Year s plot, before returning to the political analysis  CASTING: Blonde, middle aged Charlie Roan is running for president in The Purge.Election Year s main plot sees the return of Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo) from The Purge: Anarchy, and this time he s heading security for fictional woman (with more than a passing resemblance to US presidential Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, Senator Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell), who is running for president against NFFA rival Minister Edwidge Owen (Kyle Secor). We learn the Roan herself was once a victim of a purge eighteen years earlier, resulting in the death of her family. The Purge itself, was the impetus for Roan s political evolution.Flash forward to the presidential primaries, as Roan lays out a plan to eradicate America s new brutal pastime, much to the chagrin of the filmmaker s preferred villains, the NFFA. This then caused the NFFA to lift a purge ban on targeting politicians, putting Roan on the NFFA s proxy hit-list.Roan attempts to wait out the 25th purge under a 12 hour watch at home. Barnes quickly realizes that the Senator has been betrayed by her staff and an assassination attempt is carried out by the NFFA directed  Neo-Nazi mercenaries led by Earl Danzinger (Terry Serpico) who is seen with a Confederate flag patch, while also sporting nazi symbols.The mercenaries in the film immediately remind one of the 2014 Odessa clashes and subsequent Massacre there which was exacerbated by US-backed paramilitary Neo-Nazi thugs who were also used in Kiev s color revolution coup d etat centered in Maidan Square. It was later revealed that the political turmoil was being run by Hillary Clinton s Asst. Secretary of State Victoria Nuland who effectively engineered  regime change  in the Ukraine.  RADICAL REWRITE    Hellish images of murdering tourists dressed like original  Founding Fathers  comes across as heavy-handed politics. After surviving the attempt on their lives, Barnes and Roan escape the coup and take to the streets in a quasi eugenics-themed  survival of the fittest  chase-filled scene, where the heroes are fighting off murdering tourists who ve traveled to America for a murder vacation, along with fascist mercenary contractors, and also dealing with a pack of devilishly dolled up teenagers.  GLITTER & DEATH    A teenage brigade of banshees target a shop owner on purge night after not being able to steal from him.While Barnes and Roan race through the streets of downtown DC they get help from a spirited deli shop owner Joe Dixon (Mykelti Williamson) who has been forced to protect what he owns because his insurance coverage was dropped (a nod to Obamacare?), alongside his shop assistant Marcos (Joseph Julian Soria) who immigrated to America.  AMERICAN TERROR :  Bill Ayers was the brain-child of 1960 s domestic radical group the Weather Underground. (Image Source: 21WIRE)Agitprop & Government ControlHollywood often twists real world chaos into a muddled cocktail for audiences to consume.As Election Year pits a leftist radical activist group against the neocon-like NFFA (along with their fascist paramilitary thugs) we see perhaps the film s true intentions, as it presents a false left-right paradigm from which to choose from.When Election Year progresses, issues over race and immigration weave their way into the film s character development. This, along with other indicators mentioned previously, reveals a communitarian ethos as part of the film s core narrative.Although subtle, the film s most shocking mission seems to be a rather preposterous attempt to present a rigid dialectic, where ultra-violence is used to implement the anti-violent political narrative dispensed by Senator Roan and her supporters. The implied conclusion: violence is not only inevitable, it s necessary in order to achieve political and social evolution, also referred to as change. Incredulously, Roan and those closest to her, later employ the notorious CRIPs street gang to fend off the NFFA s fascist Gladio-like operators to survive the final hours of Election Year s purge.The film s use of known street gangs in this story brings up some interesting points. Historically speaking, the CRIPs were spawned in 1969, a few years after the militant black rights group the Black Panthers Party (BBP) was built up and steered into armed militancy by the FBI through the use of a confidential informant Richard Aoki. In this way, the FBI, aided by the media, helped to stir-up racial tension in America. It is also widely known that the FBI created the counter-intelligence program (COINTELPRO) to influence and disrupt political factions from the inside out. Between 1956 and 1971 (including the Socialist Workers party in 1973), the FBI s controversial program infiltrated and radicalized hundreds of left-wing and right-wing groups to control and neutralize political dissidents across America. Moreover, during the Days of Rage in 1969, the FBI was said to have been  tracking specific members  of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). The SDS was heavily connected to 60 s political agitators turned domestic terrorists,  The Weather Underground . Many concluded that the group s leader, Bill Ayers, was also an interloper looking for new recruits who could be easily manipulated into hostile action.Election Year s use of the CRIPs gang seems ironic, considering how police are on record as having also infiltrated gangs like the CRIPs, as well as likely having had direct influence on the group since the 1960 s. So what appears to be a street gang rising up against a group of paramilitary mercenaries in the film   in reality would really be a form of controlled opposition directed and steered by government infiltrators on either side. This is a reality which is routinely omitted from most TV and film narratives pretending to depict real world gangs and terrorist organizations.Similarly, the  anti-purge rebels,  led by Bishop, resemble an amalgam of the George Soros funded Black Lives Matter  movement , as well as other 1960 s radical militant organizations.Operation CHAOSAlso during the 1960 s and the 1970 s the CIA s Operation CHAOS  collected substantial amounts of information on domestic dissidents from 1967 to 1973,  as admitted by the CIA.Over 40 years ago, a horrific crime spree took place sometime between 1972 -1974 that was dubbed the Zebra Murders. It was a shocking crime spree that shook the San Francisco area to the core.The murders were supposedly refered to as Zebra, because the radio communications channel that police talked over was channel Z. Reportedly, four Black Muslim men calling themselves the  Death Angels were spawned from a known cointelpro hangout, Nation of Islam.The Death Angels were said to have shot future Mayor of San Francisco Art Angos. Some researchers on the subject have suggested that the Death Angels were trained counter-intelligence assassins tasked with fomenting a race war in America.Predictive Programming & Agent ProvocateursThere are many overlapping political memes present in The Purge: Election Year  you have the idea of a political assassination, disenfranchised militant groups, a faux anti-violent message masked as gun control, and fascist overlords. So while Election Year, comes across as a sometimes silly socio-political horror action film, its purpose may be to condition the public in accepting certain ideas and perhaps even certain political outcomes domestically in the US   something which already seems to be happening.Election Year echoes the apparent  strategy of tension  we are seeing today during America s present 2016 presidential election campaign. Earlier this year, we outlined how certain political game changers were targeting the Trump campaign, as the George Soros-funded Democrat Party-oriented advocacy group MoveOn.org and host of other splinter groups associated with Black Lives Matter, played a large role in the Chicago University student-organized shutdown at a Trump campaign rally. Since then, numerous protests and violent confrontations have been organized, serving as a disruptive force in what would normally be normal US election cycle. Left-wing critics routinely cite Donald Trump as the reason for the all the high-profile confrontations, trying to rationalize how he is somehow attracting the flash mob   when in reality the flash mobs are being organized via a few foundation-funded  community organizing  portals like MoveOn.org.  BLACK BLOC   Black bloc provocateurs, have violently escalated protest movements since the 1980 s, including 2011 s Occupy Wall Street Movement (Image Source: examiner)The echoes have still been felt from the partly Soros-funded protests in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, and the Baltimore Riots of 2015, something which immediately recalls the misguided machinations of The Occupy Movement (aka OWS) in 2011, an event that turned out to be a think-tank-spun divide and conquer stratagem designed to push naive participants into violent action.  CHICAGO CHAOS    Bernie Sanders supporters join Black Lives Matter linked groups to shutdown Trump rally (Image Source: twitter)The Dallas AgendaJust days after the release of Election Year, two controversial officer involved shootings in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and also in St. Paul, Minnesota, led to a highly coordinated protest march in downtown Dallas that erupted into chaos after a  sniper  ambush targeted police.Shortly after the attacks, The Daily Star first reported a group claiming responsibility,  A group named  Black Power Political Organization   BPPO  posted to its Facebook page this morning claiming there would be more attacks in the coming days,  but this narrative quickly shifted after the report connected the Black Men Entrepreneurship Foundation as being linked to BPPO through the same number, as reporters reached an unidentified Jamaican,  When asked if he was directly involved in the attack, he responded saying:  maybe. The overtly conspiracy-tinged aspect witnessed in mainstream media is one that conjures many Hollywood or government tales of murder, deception and intrigue throughout history. The introduction of any new  hate group  on the scene only enhances the drive by media voyeurism and fear seen after many Daily Shooter events.  MEDIA MISDIRECTION    Is BPPO a real entity   or a social media invention to stir the masses? (Image Source: rt)According to Dallas officials, 5 police officers were shot and killed with another 7 wounded (injured only two civilians). Initially, it believed that 3 or 4 other armed militants were involved   but in less than 24 hours, authorities stated it was a lone gunman, Micah Xavier Johnson.Here at 21WIRE, we ve outlined many of the main anomalies supporters concerning the recent Dallas Sniper shooting, while also examining the Gladio-style aspects of the event and so far, it appears that the heavily choreographed and emotionally driven incident has left another problem, reaction, solution in its wake.Notice the Dallas Police Department tweet (left side) where members of the DPD are seen smiling beside a  No justice, No Peace,  supporter, just hours before the sniper ambush.Here s an interesting analysis from YouTube Redsilverj, who makes many historical comparisons while breaking down the so-called Dallas  sniper  shooting Recently, 21WIRE s Patrick Henningsen outlined the political fallout seen after The Dallas Deception. Something which perpetuates the established narrative concerning socio-political concerns: The Dallas Shooting is significant on a number of levels.Firstly, Dallas will further accentuate the artificial divide between what Americans perceive as the  Left  or liberal wing of political society, and the what is sold as America s  Right  or conservative wing. In this dialectic, Democrat is set against Republican, young against old, black is pitted against white, wealthy against poor, upper class against middle class, and even middle class against lower class. In the run-up to the Presidential election in November, this division will be important in order to polarize America along a prefabricated dialectical line and thus keeping the national discourse down at a base, or emotional level   and through this binary process avoid any real examination of America s fundamental issues, policy flaws and the federal government s unsustainable bloated borrow & spend habit   effectively kicking the can down the road another 4 years (which seems to be the norm). Ultimately, this serves the state, its bureaucratic stakeholders and the power structure as a whole. Gangs, Counter Gangs & DupesIt should also be noted again that the FBI have a long record of inventing terror plots which are then used by western media outlets to promote the public terror theater, including but not limited to  would be suicide bomber on his way to Washington DC, a plot to bomb synagogues in New Jersey, a stinger missile-airliner plot, and a toy drone explosives plot against the Pentagon   all contrived through FBI cointel pro operations in the US. Said one expert:  all these dramas were facilitated by the F.B.I., whose undercover agents and informers posed as terrorists offering a dummy missile, fake C-4 explosives, a disarmed suicide vest and rudimentary training. Suspects na vely played their parts until they were arrested.  (see full report here)In a 2007 article by Nafeez Ahmed, entitled  The Strategy of Tension,  we discover the existence of many stay-behind operations under the Gladio umbrella setup by the CIA and other Western intelligence agencies: The existence of this secret operation exploded into public controversy when in August 1990 upon the admissions in parliament by Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, the existence of  Gladio  was exposed as a secret sub-section of Italian military-intelligence services, responsible for domestic bombings blamed on Italian Communists. Jay Dyer of Jay s analysis (21WIRE contributor) delves into the Gladio phenomena in the passage below: Like Operation Gladio where from the 50s to the 80s, left-wing  radicals  were blamed for Euro-terror completely engineered and staged by a covert branch of NATO intelligence and P-2 affiliated masonry lodge, similar patterns are seen in today s  terror cells  and  lone wolf shooters. Continuing, Dyer states: Indeed, it is the same pattern mentioned above domestically, with the FBI-hatched terror plots. Terror in these instances functions to exacerbate a  strategy of tension  to smear opposition, promote undue fear, and cajole the populace into accepting more surveillance and security theater.  Dallas saw a similarly implausible story last year of  conspiracy theorist  James Boulware, a  lone wolf shooter  who purportedly shot at police after incoherent online ramblings (which are quite clearly manufactured), and now we are told Micah X has a  manifesto    a must have for your daily shooter starter pack. Here s another look at an engaging and insightful interview with author Daniele Ganser, who has painstakingly documented the terror activities of security services through operation GLADIO in his book,  NATO s Secret Armies: Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe. Watch Ganser examine the historical evidence of  stay-behind  armies that appear to mirror much of the terror atrocities occurring today  In the propaganda war, the government has certain objectives   including movement and maneuver, utilizing intelligence and firing against an enemy   which is the new  Inform and Influence Activities  (IIA). As their manual states, IIA  is critical to understanding, visualizing, describing, directing, assessing, and leading operations toward attaining the desired end state. It is important to note that psyops are designed to proffer widespread disappointment and fatigue by design, to deliberately cause apathy. They can also be used in other more nefarious ways.  Gabriel Over the White House     An 1933 American film that also blends fascism and socialism.The Purge s Social ProblemThough Election Year s darkly satirical content is largely geared for a base emotional reaction, it cannot be denied that certain political groups represented in the film appear to reference much of what we ve outlined above, including a NATO-like stay-behind-army, as discussed in Daniele Ganser s research.Election Year s climatic scene depicts a devout group of NFFA faithful within a church, all of the congregation appear to be white caucasian supporters decked out in a Egyptian winged sun emblem that reminds one of the Freemasons square and compass symbol. Here, the NFFA attempt to kill Senator Roan in a ritual sacrifice but anti-purge rebels intervene, storming the church, killing nearly everyone except Roan s political rival Minister Edwidge Owen   who she wants spared for their election match-up. The scene is obviously over-the-top, conjuring the tragic and suspicious shooting in Charleston last summer through racially and emotionally charged imagery. Interestingly, what appears to be absent from Election Year, is the existence of  black-on-black  crime in America   it s as if every death is meant to polarize the viewer over race.Months after the 25th purge, the sound of fictional news reports are heard declaring mass riots across the nation following Roan s victory as president.Election Year, like other ghoulish Hollywood imaginings, emerges to distort public perception over race, guns, immigration and other socio-political concerns   while tapping into the cultural zeitgeist of America.Is this a case of Hollywood playing the role of socio-political provocateur in a real American election year?READ MORE ALTERNATIVE HOLLYWOOD NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Hollywood FilesSupport our work by subscribing and becoming a member @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"July 11, 2016"
23306,DALLAS “ATTACK” DIALECTICS: Summer of Uncle Sam,"Jay Dyer 21st Century WireAs the recent events (and subsequent incoherent media narratives) in Dallas continue to unravel, familiar patterns have already emerged that once again paint a now familiar picture of large-scale planning. We are now expected to believe this highly coordinated, professional  sniper  operation, whose numbers and details have now significantly changed, were conducted by the likes of a former vet and unknown accomplices for the purposes of targeting  white people,  and in particular, police.The new Judge Dredd-style execution by Robot! Doesn t this all sound like a scripted move?Immediately given the symbolic title  Michael X to affiliate the suspect with Malcolm X, the entire scenario, from the revised proclamation of cell terrorist to  lone wolf,  now smells of sub-par Hollywood script-writing   especially the ludicrous climax of  hidden IEDs  followed by police deploying a bomb-carrying Robocop R2D2-like executioner as the only rational means of finally halting the crazed assassin.As we will see, the event also echoes prior known false flags and staged scenarios, as well as fitting a general pattern of Soros-style color revolutions and agitation propaganda, on top of the fact that the evolving official story is preposterous.While it may appear contradictory at first glance, the notion that such an event could fit the  progressive  mold of a color revolution is not far-fetched.Consortium News details numerous Soros-funded groups that have called for soft-power coups and regime changes through numerous fronts that include  social justice  causes, as well as right-wing groups like  Right Sektor  in the Ukraine. 21stCenturyWire comments: Amazingly, by late last night and early this morning, police Chief David Brown reported that at least 3 of suspected snipers were already in custody.Brown stated early on that he believed the four suspects were working as a unit, using long-range rifles,  triangulated at elevated positions at difference places in the downtown area. The fourth suspect, Micah Xavier Johnson (the media referred to him as Micah X to intentionally prompt a Malcolm X tone to the event) a military-trained marksman and US Army veteran was said to be caught in a shoot-out with police from the second floor of the El Centro parking garage. He was upset about Black Lives Matter, the recent police shootings, he was upset at white people. He wanted to kill white people, especially police officers,  Brown said. (NY Post)  Bizarrely, according to police, Johnson (photo, above) was finally summarily executed by police after an unprecedented  risk assessment  by the Dallas police   who deployed a robot carrying a bomb. Chief Brown claimed that his officers  had no choice  but to use the bomb to kill the suspect:  Other options would have exposed our officers to grave danger. The political ripple effects of this unlikely and highly improbable event were felt immediately, as the mainstream media siege was underway, and the politicians began lining up to weigh-in and jockey for political position on any number of issue ranging from gun control, to race relations, and police brutality, but also debating the whether or not public marches and demonstrations are indeed safe for the public to attend in the face of this latest  security threat. On the police side of this dialectic, law enforcement are also queuing up to decry the violence against police and calls are omnipresent for increased police powers and security measure in order to  combat the rising threat of domestic extremism. Coincidentally, yesterday s event just happened to all on July 7th, or  7/7 ala London 7/7.  Following on that theme, the media and law enforcement began floating the term  terrorist attack  and CNN leading the pack by claiming that Dallas 7/7 was the police s  worst loss since  9/11  (Sept 11, 2001). So one can see how the spin is already being applied to this media event. Hollywood dramas that go live!Ukraine is of particular significance given the similarities between the false flag scenario of the Maidan sniper and the 7/7 purported racially-motivated event in Dallas. For both Right Sektor s Ukrainian Nationalists and Black Lives Matter s Alinsky-style Revolutionary there is a similar modus operandi of background financing and manipulation. In a piece I authored last year, I compared these similar tactics and discussed the think tank and  soft power  meta-strategy involved in geopolitical re-engineering, both domestically and abroad.Keep in mind that according to even mainstream fixture The New York Times most  terror plots  are hatched and aided by the FBI. The Soros-style NGO and soft power approach has seen the aiding of both far left and far right with the overall intent of duping progressives into war.  I wrote concerning NGOs and think tanks identity politics  and radicalization, an international operation for  change  being engineered out of New York: In the case of black youth, the Occupy-style thug culture of hip hop and rap easily combines with the radical Jihadism of intelligence agency creations like ISIS.  Both groups share a similar sense of being oppressed minorities, and both are utilized as foolish dupes of the same western establishment, dancing according to the whims of their foundation puppeteer masters.In case you were wondering, this is how the foundations and think tanks provoke minority groups with similar, but rebranded ideologies of invented revolution, particularly through the mainstream (and alternative) news cycle s scientifically precise emotionally manipulative stories that are intentionally chosen, crafted, cropped and created for the foundation/think tank revolutionary agenda.Patsies and provocateurs.This same technique is now being used for gender as a whole, as feminism,  women s rights,   gender rights,  equality, etc., now make up a large portion of the total news feed.  Increasingly taking on a clickbait style, the endless gender oppression articles are another technology for social re-engineering under the guise of appealing to the female populace.Females are undeniably more susceptible to emotional appeals and advertising deception, the same marketing styles of ad campaigns for endless hygiene products now mirrors the mindless, gender-based  stories  of oppressed trans teens and eternally victimized and  oppressed  western women (who have the highest living standards in the world).  While western women conduct their war on the patriarchal power by sharing these retarded stories on their iPads, they are just as much the dupes of the same foundation/think tank techniques as the low IQ ISIS  recruits  and the ghetto mobs.On the other side of the dialectic are the equally duped  right wingers  who still champion the Bush Dynasty and so-called American  freedoms,  the great envy of all the world that must be protected at all costs from an absolutely impossible, fabricated foreign invasion by ISIS. Constituting the new boogey-man in the patriot/tea party mythos, the invasion of the western intelligence created and backed  ISIS  is the phony  bad man  parallels the phony bad man  of the thugs (the 1%, which is actually anyone middle class), and the bad man  of the narcissistic American female, the patriarchy.All of these  bad men  are invented bad men, manufactured and created by the foundations and think tanks to manipulate your specific population niche.  The establishment has recruited and used dumb, low IQ, prison-convert, Muslim mind-controlled bots for decades, just as the system has used dumb, low IQ females as poster children for  gender revolution. The  Sniper  Effect Unknown Snipers  are a classic tactic of Western-influenced regime changes, including Romania in 1989 in regard to Ceaucescu, which is particularly relevant to our situation, as the coup there involved a revolt against police.  Sniper death squads in Romania aided by western intelligence would thus be a perfect parallel to anti-police engineered  sniping  in Dallas.Other events where snipers were involved in regime change and staged agitprop include the  Arab Spring,  Yeltsin s counter-government in 1993, Venezuela in 2002, Thailand in 2010, and more recently, Kyrgyzstan, Egypt, Libya and Syria.  Supposed unknown snipers, like terrorists, provide a useful function for existing regimes or foreign powers to conveniently concoct and steer events by pinning blame on patsies.Same strategy of controlled, radical opposition in a game of obvious dialectics.Like Operation Gladio where from the 50s to the 80s, left-wing  radicals  were blamed for Euro-terror completely engineered and staged by a covert branch of NATO intelligence and P-2 affiliated masonry lodge, similar patterns are seen in today s  terror cells  and  lone wolf shooters.  Some wondered why I originally mentioned the masonic apparel in the original post, but this is because Gladio used P-2 and secret societies can function as networks for organizing and arranging provocateurs, much like the Muslim Brotherhood or ISIS.  In short, sniping events, just like  false flags,  are run by and advantageous to the state, not lone wolves and terror cells.Indeed, it is the same pattern mentioned above domestically, with the FBI-hatched terror plots. Terror in these instances functions to exacerbate a  strategy of tension  to smear opposition, promote undue fear, and cajole the populace into accepting more surveillance and security theater.  Dallas saw a similarly implausible story last year of  conspiracy theorist  James Boulware, a  lone wolf shooter  who purportedly shot at police after incoherent online ramblings (which are quite clearly manufactured), and now we are told Micah X has a  manifesto    a must have for your daily shooter starter pack.Highly dubious James Boulware Dallas  Shooting Fusion  DrillsAs noted in my original video, at least two large-scale, multi-agency DHS supervised  fusion  drills in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area preceded the 7/7 event by only a week.  One drill even included  three shooters and bombs,  a narrative now fed into the mainstream media concerning the Dallas sniping event. Given every major terror event of recent recollection has been preceded by a drill of the same scenario, it should be obvious to question the Dallas event, as it fits the same patterns as prior  terror. The familiar narrative of Dallas now includes  IEDs  hidden in mysterious locales, a dubious claim inserted into the narrative of James Holmes   booby-trapped  apartment, for example.  The date and locale for the event is also suspicious, being in the vicinity of the JFK assassination as well as on the anniversary of the London 7/7 bombing, another staged event.We are supposed to believe  Micah X  learned his sniping and IED skills in the military and subsequently coordinated a professional hit man operation to target random white police over the shootings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling that occurred that day!  Mass media claimed the supposed shooter was angry about events that transpired that day, and subsequently had time to perform reconnaissance and establish sniper spots for that day s Black Lives Matter Protest.Lunacy does not end there, as the standoff with police then involved the preposterous claim of utilizing and  bomb-bot  to blow the suspect up, as he supposedly refused to cooperate.  Are bomb-bots now standard procedure?  Were the mainstream narrative of this event true (and it certainly is not), wouldn t law enforcement choose to gas the subject or subdue him, to gather information about his so-called terror cell?  Instead, the public was fed a fantastical Robocop storyline to add tabloid juice to this manufactured event, as we have seen in so many.Patsies, dupes and provocateurs. Black power  groups are notorious for being infiltrated by federal agents and provocateurs, and the New Black Panther Party is a shining example.  Allowed to consistently call for the death of all whites (which is illegal), this fake front group is allowed to continue to agitate and play on public fears, like other  terror groups  and racial identity movements.  Like the KKK or Elohim City and McVeigh, the black power and Nation of Islam movements have been exposed as phony government fronts many times, often identified by their outlandish and outrageous calls for violence.Most famously, this was seen in the COINTELPRO operation, with FBI informant Richard Aoki arming the Black Panthers to make them appear distastefully radical.Photo-op. Patty Hearst and the theatrical SLA  abduction. The Saul Alinsky-style approach of manufacturing radicals for self-destructive social  change  that marks this event also has precedent in two other previously contrived  terror  attacks: The Alinsky-inspired Bill Ayers Weather Underground event, and Patty Hearst SLA staging.  Both events were manufactured operations that served to solidify mass opinion against anti-war movements, while the SLA event (in which reportedly 6 died, while Patty Hearst was not even in the building) became the basis for America s adoption of SWAT teams   the Hearst soap opera kidnapping was even followed by a television show called  SWAT  that aided in the rise of America s acceptance of the  Warrior Cop. This fact, as well as the long-term federalization of local police refutes the faux right-wing narrative that Obama and company are  anti-cop. Seen in this light, the Dallas event is ably summed up in its effectiveness for the establishment by Patrick Henningsen: The Dallas Shooting is significant on a number of levels.Firstly, Dallas will further accentuate the artificial divide between what Americans perceive as the  Left  or liberal wing of political society, and the what is sold as America s  Right  or conservative wing. In this dialectic, Democrat is set against Republican, young against old, black is pitted against white, wealthy against poor, upper class against middle class, and even middle class against lower class. In the run-up to the Presidential election in November, this division will be important in order to polarize America along a prefabricated dialectical line and thus keeping the national discourse down at a base, or emotional level   and through this binary process avoid any real examination of America s fundamental issues, policy flaws and the federal government s unsustainable bloated borrow & spend habit   effectively kicking the can down the road another 4 years (which seems to be the norm). Ultimately, this serves the state, its bureaucratic stakeholders and the power structure as a whole. Secondly, this event can be used to nudge the  left-wing  and Democrat party s own gun control agenda, which is being aggressively pursued at the moment. This wing of the political establishment has already demonstrated that it has no qualms about using a national incident or tragedy, like the Orlando Shooting, as warm PR leverage to push their  emergency  legislative agenda. Ironically,  left-wing  and black activists will be blamed for this latest act of political violence and will be used in this case to further advance the political left s own bespoke gun control agenda   much to the dismay of  Conservative America. As a result of this staged event carried out by agent provocateurs,  anti-police  or  anti-government  African-American  militant , or  Black Power  activists will be painted a poor light, and effectively marginalized. Once this process is complete, the state can then move in to extend that marginalization to any anti-government  protests   further neutering any real grass-roots opposition for what is obviously a rapidly growing police state in the US.Thirdly, this event is being used to increase tension between the public and law enforcement. Note the differences between the short and the long-term narratives at play here. In the short-term, this Dallas Sniper event is originally designed as a  reaction  to US police killing poor unarmed black men on the streets of America, but in the long-term the pendulum will swing back to the state in order to  restore law and order , thus further consolidating power into a more concentrated police state. This is evidenced already by US law enforcement are already rallying in solidarity, in an us against them dialectic by placing the nation s police as the protagonist and the public as the antagonist. Pop culture promotion of supposed anti-establishment agitation and  revolution.  In reality, it is top-down social engineering and psychological warfare.Given the government admission that much of modern history has been manipulated and contrived through false flags and staged events, is it sensible to take the Dallas event at face value?  We are constantly reminded in every terror  event to  never forget  9/11, but a much more apt recollection would be to never forget the admissions and examples of fake and staged news, as well as individuals who supposedly die in three separate  terror  events being still alive show the lunacy of the fact there is no law or regulation upon the government and private infotainment news agencies barring them from manufacturing events.  Rather, the pattern 21Wire recognized and exposed in the recent Andrews Air Force Base s phony  live shooter  drill-gone-live scenario serves as the exemplary form of how these events are engineered   especially given the drills preceding the 7/7 Dallas event.Naturally, the  alt right  will seize upon the event as proof of a racial attack, but this simply plays into the establishment s desire for a helter skelter  race war and a  summer of chaos,  all of which was prepared for symbolically through Beyonc s militant  Black Panther  Super Bowl Halftime Show back in February.  The  race war  is not fought with bats and maces in the streets, but through the toxic culture itself with its insidious programming for each racial group.As we have seen in past events,  gun control  is once again the unanimous cacophony, while the labeling of  Black Lives Matter  as a  terrorist  group only serves to set further precedence for anyone critical of the establishment as an  extremist  or  terrorist.

23308,DALLAS MAIDAN: Staged Snipers Designed to Inflict 7/7 ‘Strategy of Tension’,"Daily Shooter 21st Century WireLast night, a highly emotive and politicized GLADIO-style event unfolded in America. Still, after so many other similar events recorded throughout recent history   all followed by similarly predictable political fall-outs and effects   the general public are still slow to grasp what is really happening before their eyes. The event in Dallas falls into a similar pattern of other high-profile  sniper  attacks, all of which were stage false flag events designed with a particular political, or geopolitical purpose in mind.Regarding last night, here s what we know so far The plot: According to law enforcement officials, at least 5 police officers were shot and killed with another 7 wounded, after 3 or 4 alleged snipers described as  radical left-wing  and armed  militant black activists , fired from surrounding buildings into an 800-strong  Black Lives Matter  protest crowd who were marching in downtown Dallas, Texas. Amazingly, we re told that only one civilian was reportedly injured. IMAGE: #BlackLivesMatter protesters rally around recent victims Philando Castile and Alton Sterling (Photo: Indian Express/ Reuters).Protesters are said to have been marching against the recent police shootings of two black men in the cities of Baton Rouge, Louisiana and also in St. Paul, Minnesota.The following onlookers  videos were released from the Dallas incident. Watch: Amazingly, by late last night and early this morning, police Chief David Brown reported that at least 3 of suspected snipers were already in custody.Brown stated early on that he believed the four suspects were working as a unit, using long-range rifles,  triangulated at elevated positions at difference places in the downtown area. The fourth suspect, Micah Xavier Johnson (the media referred to him as  Micah X  to intentionally prompt a Malcolm X tone to the event), we are told was a  military-trained  US Army veteran, who was said to be caught in a shoot-out with police from the second floor of the El Centro parking garage. He was upset about Black Lives Matter, the recent police shootings, he was upset at white people. He wanted to kill white people, especially police officers,  Brown said. (NY Post)  Bizarrely, according to police, Johnson (photo, above) was finally summarily executed by police after an unprecedented  risk assessment  by the Dallas police   who deployed a  robot carrying a bomb.  Chief Brown claimed that his officers  had no choice  but to use the bomb to kill the suspect:  Other options would have exposed our officers to grave danger. The political ripple effects of this unlikely and highly improbable event were felt immediately, as the mainstream media siege was underway, and the politicians began lining up to weigh-in and jockey for political position on any number of issue ranging from gun control, to race relations, and police brutality, but also debating the whether or not public marches and demonstrations are indeed  safe for the public  to attend in the face of this latest  security threat. On the police side of this dialectic, law enforcement are also queuing up to decry the violence against police and calls are omnipresent for increased police powers and security measure in order to  combat the rising threat of domestic extremism. Coincidentally, yesterday s event just happened to all on July 7th, or  7/7  ala London 7/7.  Following on that theme, the media and law enforcement began floating the term  terrorist attack  and CNN leading the pack by claiming that Dallas 7/7 was the police s  worst loss since  9/11  (Sept 11, 2001). So one can see how the spin is already being applied to this media event.The Maidan MassacreBack February 2014, events transpired in Kiev, Ukraine which sparked international outrage and calls for  regime change  in Kiev, and served as the key catalyst for a coup d etat and the ouster of Ukraine s democratically elected president Viktor Yanukovych.  A leaked phone call between EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton and Estonian foreign affairs minister showed how there was knowledge at the highest levels of European government, but western leaders opted to maintain a disinterested stance in the face of this new evidence. Listen to the phone call here: Earlier this year, in January 2016, one such academic investigation concluded that the sniper event at Maidan Square was in fact a  false flag  event which was used to create a false public perception of events and usher in a shift in political power in that country. Canadian political science professor Dr. Ivan Katchanovski of Ottawa University concluded that This academic investigation concludes that the massacre was a false flag operation, which was rationally planned and carried out with a goal of the overthrow of the government and seizure of power,  wrote Katchanovski in his study, called  The  Snipers  Massacre  on the Maidan in Ukraine. Despite all these revelations, the US, UK and the EU are still standing by their earlier narrative of the sniper massacre as a,   Euromaidan democratic, peaceful mass-protest movement and a  color  revolution led by pro-Western parties. Ukraine s own internal investigation into the matter has been shown to be a highly political exercise, which appears to have resulted in a comprehensive cover-up of what really happened on the day.Snipers in Homs, SyriaIn the early days of what western governments and media were portraying as an  Arab Spring  color uprising in Syria in 2010 and 2011, unknown snipers played a crucial role in advancing a  strategy of tension  and fomenting civil unrest, particularly in the city of Homs. Snipers were reported as firing on citizens and also shooting at police indiscriminately. The western media s policy was not to report on this, but only to report on the state security reaction and crack-down triggered by these mysterious and seemingly random acts of violence.Some independent writers and researchers have reported on the anomalies of the Homs shootings, but as yet, no in-depth investigation has taken place.However, the testimony of Father Frans Van der Lugt in Homs, provided a look into what was happening during this ugly phase of a western and GCC-backed rebellion being waged in Syria: From the start, the protest movements were not purely peaceful. From the start I saw armed demonstrators marching along in the protests, who began to shoot at the police first. Very often the violence of the security forces has been a reaction to the brutal violence of the armed rebels. It s clear now after looking back at numerous reports about these incidents, that they were designed to instigate a crisis, which would ultimately lead to either a political instability and civil unrest.The other aspect of these false flag  events, is that they have the potential to also redefine the relationship between the public and the state and its security apparatus.In each instance, a  regime change  was expected, although this was not completely successful in the case of Syria.The Dallas DeceptionThe Dallas Shooting is significant on a number of levels.Firstly, Dallas will further accentuate the artificial divide between what Americans perceive as the  Left  or liberal wing of political society, and the what is sold as America s  Right  or conservative wing. In this dialectic, Democrat is set against Republican, young against old, black is pitted against white, wealthy against poor, upper class against middle class, and even middle class against lower class. In the run-up to the Presidential election in November, this division will be important in order to polarize America along a prefabricated dialectical line and thus keeping the national discourse down at a base, or emotional level   and through this binary process avoid any real examination of America s fundamental issues, policy flaws and the federal government s unsustainable bloated borrow & spend habit   effectively kicking the can down the road another 4 years (which seems to be the norm). Ultimately, this serves the state, its bureaucratic stakeholders and the power structure as a whole. Secondly, this event can be used to nudge the  left-wing  and Democrat party s own gun control agenda, which is being aggressively pursued at the moment. This wing of the political establishment has already demonstrated that it has no qualms about using a national incident or tragedy, like the Orlando Shooting, as warm PR leverage to push their  emergency  legislative agenda. Ironically,  left-wing  and black activists will be blamed for this latest act of political violence and will be used in this case to further advance the political left s own bespoke gun control agenda   much to the dismay of  Conservative America. As a result of this staged event carried out by agent provocateurs,  anti-police  or  anti-government  African-American  militant , or  Black Power  activists will be painted a poor light, and effectively marginalized. Once this process is complete, the state can then move in to extend that marginalization to any  anti-government  protests   further neutering any real grass-roots opposition for what is obviously a rapidly growing police state in the US.Thirdly, this event is being used to increase tension between the public and law enforcement. Note the differences between the short and the long-term narratives at play here. In the short-term, this Dallas Sniper event is originally designed as a  reaction  to US police killing poor unarmed black men on the streets of America, but in the long-term the pendulum will swing back to the state in order to  restore law and order , thus further consolidating power into a more concentrated police state. This is evidenced already by US law enforcement are already rallying in solidarity, in an  us against them  dialectic by placing the nation s police as the protagonist and the public as the antagonist.This obvious dialectical theme is already being echoed internationally on Twitter, as police in the US and the UK advance the term  Thin Blue Line :The Thin Blue Line stretches across the country tonight. We stand by you @DallasPD #Dallas #ThinBlueLine pic.twitter.com/zyiFJWYFDh  NYPD 108th Precinct (@NYPD108Pct) July 8, 2016It should be noted here that the colloquial policing term Thin Blue Line is derived from the term Thin Red Line , which describes as an inferior, outnumbered force holding back the hordes. The original reference of this comes from a Battle of Balaclava   fought by the Highland Infantry Brigade for the British Army during the 19th century Crimean War. Explained: The Thin Red Line has become an English language figure of speech for any thinly spread military unit holding firm against attack. The phrase has also taken on the metaphorical meaning of the barrier which the relatively limited armed forces of a country present to potential attackers.  (Wiki)It s important to understand the symbolism behind this term  Thin Blue Line  which is currently being invoked by law enforcement. It implies an  us against them  dialectical narrative, arguably, quite far and remote from the familiar peace officer-oriented slogan  Protect and Serve.   Finally, this event will be used to reinforce and heighten the ever-increasing profile of America s bizarre new post-9/11 Cult of the First Responder, which appears to be an extension of the  Cult of Our Boys , a lionization campaign which was developed by the Pentagon over years of mass US troop deployment in two highly unpopular wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The main thrust of the effort to glorify and assert to preeminence of the First Responder is part and parcel of a wider US agenda to fully militarize US domestic society, and to characterize US public life as a combat zone, or domestic war zone which society devolves its authority and constant crisis management over to America s new unified command structure and Gendarmerie   the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the FBI.Between the 1960 s and 1990 s, Operation GLADIO saw numerous staged terror events carried out in Europe in order to advance a  strategy of tension . All of the alleged  terrorist  attacks during this time were later proven to be the work not of terrorists, but of the security and intelligence services. Many innocent civilians died, and still to date, no one has been convicted, much less brought before a court or public hearing on a dirty state-sponsored program which many believe is still running to this day, albeit in one form or another.Expect the political rhetoric to spin out of control with each media cycle over the next 72 hours, before fading into Monday. Such is the nature of the Daily Shooter in these troubled and fleetingly real times.Stay tuned here for more stories and updates on the Dallas Deception.READ MORE DALLAS SHOOTING NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Dallas Shooting FilesSupport our work by subscribing and becoming a member @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"July 8, 2016"

23312,US Media Hyped ‘Active Shooter’ Drill at Andrews Base As Real Event,"21st Century Wire says Yesterday, we were told by US media that one of the country s key military installations, Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, home of the president s Air Force One airliner, was in lockdown following reports of an  Active Shooter  situation.While the entire US media went into orange alert mode for over 2 and a half hours, 21WIRE recognized exactly what it was, a drill, and called it correctly while the news was breaking. We re told that initial reports of a  active shooter  were prompted by an emergency 911 call to outside law enforcement about a gunman seen on the base. The fact that this alleged  distress call  came from a  staff member  at the Malcolm Grow Medical Facility located inside Andrews (one of the country s most secure closed military facilities) should have raised some pertinent questions   like why base security were not informed first, as one would expect. Furthermore, any reports by the US mainstream media characterizing the event as a genuine  active shooter  crisis should have been immediately squashed by the fact that Joint Base Andrews was also running a no-notice  Active Shooter Exercise scheduled for 9 am that morning. Sadly, this did not happen, and all US media outlets began their crisis reporting   complete with the usual panel of security  experts  and  justice correspondents on CNN and other mainstream networks.21WIRE Calls it CorrectlyWhile the US media was reporting the base was in full lockdown and appeared  confused  about what to make of the situation, 21WIRE analyst Patrick Henningsen appeared on RT International while the story was breaking, offering a very different take on the event than what was being reported at the time throughout the US media. Here s what he said:PART 1: PART 2: Finally, 1 hour later, US authorities finally admitted that  it was only a drill  and that the dramatic lockdown had been lifted.Some might say this was not a hard event to call, and in fact was a  no-brainer    and in this case they would be correct. For any keen student of false flags and high-profile mass shootings in recent years, it was overtly obvious what kind of drama was playing out.The real story however, is how the entire US media transformed into one giant web of media disinformation amplification from the moment the false media reports and  official Tweets  from the US military hit the news wires   without even pausing to consider that they were all knowing, or unknowing (but certainly willing) participants within their media/press compartment of the so-called  Active Shooter  drill.JBA is currently on lockdown due to a report of an active shooter. All personnel are directed to shelter in place. More info as it comes.  Joint Base Andrews (@JBA_NAFW) June 30, 2016The mainstream media did their level best to use this falsely presented nonevent in order to reinforce the federal government s prime PR compliance directives; a running list of mindless Orwellian police state throw away slogans like,  See something, say something,  and  Shelter in place. The end result of all this is a public who are unnecessarily traumatized, or subjected to psychological stress, in effect terrorizing the public, as a result of poor media reporting and dereliction of journalism by a media profession who are all too happy to go along with a high TV ratings draw of a  Active Shooter  narrative.Rather amazingly, one reporter from CBS News even admitted that the national  lockdown  scare did not even interrupt that day s drill and that their on-base Active Shooter exercise would continue throughout the day. This should provide as much evidence as one would need to deduce that the media scare was indeed part of the drill itself, although this concept might prove just too difficult to grasp for any US mainstream news anchor or reporter. Watch the CBS report here:  What happened is a common thing, it s just, you know, it s sort of the times we live in  there were two personnel carrying rifles, long guns, someone in the medical center saw that and phoned in there was a shooter on the base Williams then brushed the misreporting off as  normal,  before also parroting the tired mantra,  When you see something, say something.  Watch as a confused Williams tries to rationalize the day s over-the-top media debacle: Luckily, it did not, but yesterdays event does raise some very crucial questions about the highly reactionary and irrational nature of our security-obsessed media, and a police state  fusion  apparatus which spends hundreds of millions of taxpayer funds each year in order prepare for some ubiquitous  threat  which statistically does not actually threaten very many Americans and yet   seems to overly-dominate media coverage, as well the operating budgets government agencies and first responder cohorts nationwide.The following is a short video which every American should watch, which explains some of the more worrying aspects of America s new obsession with domestic hyper militarized responses   in preparation for what seems like an endless stream of  mass shooting  and  domestic terror  events: Support our work and Become a Member @ 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"July 1, 2016"
23313,Brief Overview: US Military Sales to Lebanon,"21st Century Wire says The business of defense.In order to sustain mammoth defense sector based in North America, the U.S. relies on international procurement and sales of both new and close-out military industrial goods.Although a relatively small country in size, Lebanon is a key position on the Middle East chessboard, and could one day become an emerging military market for US defense corporations. In Washington DC, however, the topic of US military aid the Lebanon is a relatively hushed affair because of the Israeli Lobby s influence over US lawmakers. Technically, Israel and its neighbor Lebanon aew still at war, so any US funds allocated to the Lebanese Armed Forces is seen as an affront to Tel Aviv.In 2014, the US awarded $156 million in aid to Lebanon   which is money that Lebanon would be required to spend exclusively with US corportions, as per the usual arrange with all  tied  US aid (except for Israel, who seems to enjoy a more flexible arrangement with some special dispensation to spend its annual $3.2 billion in US military aid where it wants).Here are the specs of Lebanon s defense orders from US firms Boiling Frogs Post   Researcher Christian Sorensen analyzes weapon sales from the U.S. war industry to the Lebanese armed forces.

JBA is currently on lockdown due to a report of an active shooter. All personnel are directed to shelter in place. More info as it comes.  Joint Base Andrews (@JBA_NAFW) June 30, 2016There s only one problem with this story: we also learned that the base had planned a no-notice  Active Shooter Exercise scheduled for 9 am this morning, and as if by some amazing coincidence, during exercise, local first responders received emergency calls about a  real world  active shooter on the base. Still, this hasn t stopped flippant news anchors and  expert  analysts from US media outlets like CNN and FOX News from going into media-siege mode, and treating the event as if it were a real  active shooter  event   and injecting addition, unnecessary fear in the public discourse this morning.If one follows the inter-agency security protocols for a security exercise such as this, it would play out more or less exactly as it has today thus far, as evidenced by announcements by what other law enforcement and emergency services are saying.NBC News local affiliate adds here: Fort Belvoir in Virginia says it is increasing its  security posture  in response to the incident at Joint Base Andrews. It has advised its personnel to stay clear of Joint Base Andrews.  Last month Andrews had another  active  event, in what apparently turned-out to be a non-threat. Last month, Joint Base Andrews was placed on lockdown after a woman walked onto the base and claimed she had a bomb. An Explosive Ordinance Disposal team found the woman had no explosives, and she was apprehended.  The only question left now is: is this a real  active shooter  situation, or is this merely another example of a  drill gone live ?UPDATE 11:15AM ET: [Yes, we called it before authorities finally admitted  it was only drill ] JOINT BASE ANDREWS, Md.  Andrews Air Force Base is  all clear  after a lock-down Thursday morning, amid confusion during an active shooter drill, according to a law enforcement official.

23316,"THOUGHT POLICE: US Border Control Wants to Study Your Facebook, Twitter Accounts","Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireIf this latest proposal from the US becomes policy, it could be a major watershed point for the globalized police state, allowing governments to not only to profile you, but also to target and even exclude individuals based on their online speech and activity. This week we learned that US border control have been running a shadow  test  program behind the scenes, where travelers into the US are asked to declare their  online presence , including any social media accounts and associated blogs.The US Federal Register states,  Collecting social media data will enhance the existing investigative process and provide Department of Homeland Security (DHS) greater clarity and visibility to possible nefarious activity and connections by providing an additional tool set which analysts and investigators may use to better analyze and investigate the case. In the hive mind of the state, the term nefarious is proven to be a flexible one, and could encompass persons of any political or intellectual persuasion who travel internationally. Where does it end?So who are these arbiters of political thought and social discourse?According to this recent report by The Guardian, the  deciders  are likely to be hourly wage earners working for the TSA, or contractors working under the banner of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Initially, these workers would be tasked with analyzing your  online presence : US Customs and Border Protection s proposed change would add a line on both the online and paper forms of the visa application form that visitors to the US must fill out if they do not have a visa and are planning on staying for up to 90 days.The following question would be added to both the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (Esta) and I-94W forms:  Please enter information associated with your online presence Provider/Platform Social media identifier. Thus far, the DHS claim they are only running a limited  pilot program , one which the agency is keeping confidential and out of the public eye. Officials claim that the secrecy surrounding this controversial program is because they don t want to reveal their methods for identifying a potential  terror threat.  Millions of visitors disembark in US each week (Photo: Flickr user Tom May via Fast Company)In practical terms, with 10 million visa applications and over 77 million visitors annually   what we are really seeing here is a giant  big data  capturing exercise that will quickly generate an additional column on your personal database   sitting alongside your standard personal, facial recognition and other biometric ID information, as well as your travel history, and anchored by the RFID chip already embedded in most international passports.How the DHS expects its border control staff to properly vet and verify the information in question before a traveler passes through border security is hard to ascertain. The potential for misinformation is ever present.Eventually, processing this amount of data will probably be farmed out to high speed intelligent, or A.I. computer systems. Similar high-end, algorithm-based analytical surveillance programs like PRISM is already being used by US and UK government agencies to trawl through masses of public online activity, so it only stands to reason that A.I. will eventually perform the job of flagging-up any undesirables.If you went by the US media rhetoric you d think that Facebook and Twitter were the number one causes of global terrorism. No surprise then, that the battle cry for this latest DHS program has to be last December s apparent  ISIS-inspired terrorist event  in San Bernardino, and the subsequent controversy over the FBI s ability access to one of the suspect s encrypted iPhone 5C.What s more likely to be driving this grand security directive is not necessarily some effective plan to  keep people safe , but rather, highly lucrative commercial interests.CIA is investing in firms that specialize in sifting through social media postshttps://t.co/nDVBvKt0bz pic.twitter.com/jiWZgQhYDX  RT America (@RT_America) April 15, 2016No Private SpacesPerhaps the most troubling aspect of this story has to do with assessing the relationship between the individual and the government and the expectation of privacy in a so-called democratic or  free  society.In this instance, the government is adopting a blanket policy of judging a person as  guilty until proven innocent.  By ceding this expectation to the government, an individual consenting to this arrangement by forgoing his or her right to privacy and due process. As history shows us time and time again, once you give this away, it s very difficult to get back.In a BBC interview this week, Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Centre for Democracy and Technology points out one of the fundamental flaws in the government s new regime, as he explains: It s very hard to see travellers not filling out this item   even though it s optional   as they may fear not getting entry into the country. Democracy in general requires having spaces free from government scrutiny and increasingly social life happens online.   We would have a poor society if people were chilled from participating in social activity online so I really hope they rethink this. Now many Americans might look at this story and think,  This doesn t affect me, it s only for foreigners.  While that may seem true on the surface, the reality is that this DHS system is designed for Americans too. Consider it phase one. Besides this, do not be surprised if whatever rights you deny your neighbor, will eventually be denied of you too.This is what technocracy looks like   it s brutal, unforgiving, and ultimately unresponsive to common sense and reason. Worst of all, it pretends to be driven by a perceived public interest in safety and security, but in reality the only security that s ever achieved through such measures   are secure profits for a select number of corporate firms fortunate enough to win corporate contracts in the ever-expanding security theatre that is Homeland Security.

23317,Clinton and Associates’ Education Ponzi Scheme," Dady Chery News Junkie Post Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me.    F. Scott FitzgeraldEducation is the latest public commons that is being turned into a commodity by a group of the world s arrivistes, including Douglas Becker, Donald Trump, and Bill and Hillary Clinton. Money brings, in those who obsessively accumulate it, a transformation of thought and deed that is most discernible in the nouveaux riches.To give meaning to their purchasing power, they commodify all they can. As part of this process, and almost as a celestial joke, they also become persuaded that anything can be bought. Gradually, they come to believe that money will guarantee access to anything, the acquiescence or corruption of anyone, the evasion of any law or ailment, and the repair of any deficiency including, in many cases, a spotty education.Consider 49-year old Douglas Becker, the founder, Chairman, and CEO of a network of 88 for-profit institutions in 28 countries that offer  undergraduate, master s and doctoral  degrees and enroll more than a million students. Becker s for-profit institutions, which are mainly in South America and Europe, although also in the United States and quickly branching out through Asia and the Middle East, cynically exploit the deeply held belief by many people that an education is a passport out of poverty, to in-debt, ambitious working-class people.Laureate has especially targeted as a market Latin America, where in many countries only about 20 percent of college-age people manage to gain admission to the public universities. Such institutions are free, but they require passing grades on difficult entrance exams and are the most prestigious schools in these countries.Becker did not reach his status by attending college. Possibly he regards as a fool anyone who does, although he claims that his mission is to make a college education more accessible. According to Bloomberg Markets, Becker worked at a Computer Land store while he was in high school, and he got his first taste of money by selling to Blue Cross Blue Shield the idea of a swipe card with patient information. He then built on this wealth by buying a stake in a chain of tutoring services called Sylvan Learning Systems, taking Sylvan public in 1993, and targeting universities on the verge of bankruptcy for purchase by Sylvan.The first such acquisition was Universidad Europea de Madrid (UEM) in 1999. UEM now boasts of 15,600 students and claims that 90 percent  attain employment within 12 months of completing their studies,  but it mentions nothing whatever about its faculty, which is known to have dropped by more than 40 percent within its first five years under Laureate.As UEM has cut its teaching staff, it has increased its cachet by inviting famous people to its campus to accept honorary degrees and large speaking fees. Like the Wizard of Oz, Becker confers degrees on anyone he wishes, including honorary doctorates from UEM on South Africa s Nelson Mandela and Turkey s Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Istanbul Bilgi University, where the faculty was cut and prevented from unionizing even as the enrollment grew by more than 40 percent and the tuition climbed to $14,000 per year, was among about 20 institutions that Sylvan controlled by 2007. That year, Becker renamed his operation Laureate Education and took it private in a $3.4 billion deal that might have been conceived to prevent the scrutiny of shareholders.The main backers included Henry Kravis, of the New York based equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR); Steven Cohen of Point 72 Asset Management (formerly SAC Capital Management); and Citigroup Private Equity. Within three years of Kravis  investment of $487 million, his portion of the business grew to $711 million.Financial analyst and whistleblower Charles Ortel points out that the buyout involved unnecessary risks, and one of the main players, Steven Cohen, had to make a $1.2 billion settlement with the US Justice Department in 2014 for allegations of insider trading regarding another business deal. Ortel explains: When the management of a publicly traded company wants to take the company private, there is an inherent conflict of interest because the management knows more than the public as it raises the money to buy up the public shares. In this case, the process of negotiating among multiple parties with aligned and with competing financial interests took about 15 months from start to finish: a quite long time. The buyout transaction was completed on August 17, 2007, just as strains on the global economy and financial system began to accentuate. Given the financial performance of Laureate since August 2007 and the risks that are materializing now, the price paid to other public shareholders of Laureate by Douglas Becker and members of the buying group may seem attractive, in hindsight. Regulators might choose to re-examine more carefully the process by which Mr. Becker secured financing to buy out public shareholders, concentrating on the variances, if any, between representations made to investors and lenders to the buying group, with disclosures made to the selling shareholder. Details of another profitable move by Becker became known just before Hillary Clinton s announcement of her latest presidential bid, when she and Bill Clinton made public their federal income tax information. In their tax returns, $16.5 million of payments from Laureate to Bill Clinton were disclosed that purportedly were made for his role as the Honorary Chancellor of Laureate International University. Recall that Hillary Clinton had become the US Secretary of State in 2009 and that Bill Clinton was, at all times in position to exercise significant influence over the affairs of the Clinton Foundation and all its affiliates, including Clinton Global Initiative, Inc. (New CGI), which had been involved with Laureate in a venture known as Clinton Global Initiative-University or  CGI-U  Charles Ortel said.Indeed, during the same period, the State Department initially granted $55 million to International Youth Foundation, a charity in which Becker has been actively involved for years and that is based in Maryland. The US government later organized for Laureate to receive $100 million from the World Bank s International Finance Corporation (IFC); in this transaction, a fund managed by the IFC provided $50 million and the sovereign wealth fund of Korea provided $50 million.Ortel has verified the Clintons  taxes and says they are a huge mess. He notes that: Bill and Hillary Clinton each earned substantial sums for speeches rendered in numerous states other than New York and Washington, DC, and many countries other than the US, yet they have not supplied information concerning such state and foreign tax filings. Furthermore the Clintons did not disclose their transactions with Laureate as Related-Party Transactions in their IRS Form 990s for the Clinton Foundation and New CGI, not only in their original filings for 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, but also in their corrected filings. It is not even clear how CGI-U is controlled, whether it is registered in all legal jurisdictions where it operates, or what its financial results may have been. In an interview with Richard Johnson of the New York Post, Trump advisor Roger Stone wondered if the Clintons got rich from State Department funds. Further, he accused the Clintons of helping Laureate to eliminate its competition. Stone argued that the payments to Bill Clinton have protected Laureate from government attacks on their accreditation and fitness for student loans even as much smaller operations like Corinthian and Trump University have been severely hit.Corinthian went bankrupt in 2015 after a federal district court in Illinois found it to be liable for $530 million in predatory loans for promising its students jobs that did not materialize and getting them heavily indebted. Trump University was recently hit by fraud lawsuits from New York and California for calling itself a university, although it had been doing so since its inception in 2005. By contrast, no lawsuit so far has stuck to Laureate.Possibly the main mistake of Trump U. and Corinthian has been to grow on US citizens, unlike Laureate, which has taken care to parasitize foreign nationals first, particularly working-class people from emerging powers.Bill Clinton s greatest help to Laureate has likely come as introductions to foreign politicians, most of them probably corrupt, who could influence their governments  student loan programs. The highest number of campuses in any single country so far is in Brazil, where Laureate owns 12 institutions. There Dilma Rousseff s seven-fold increase of government-backed student loans has been a great boon. The Centro Universario IBMR of Rio de Janeiro is a typical campus. Enrollment there has more than tripled because of a Ponzi scheme in which, to pay their loans, students become employed as telemarketers who recruit new students and are paid by the head.The school remains open although Rio s legislature has criticized it for firing faculty while it achieved its extraordinary expansion. In Chile, where President Sebastian Pinera raised taxes around 2012 to fund student loans, Laureate owns five institutions. At Santiago s Universidad de Las Am ricas (UDLA), accreditation was withdrawn in 2013 because graduation rates had dived, and 10,000 new students had been added as the number of teachers had dropped. UDLA accepts students with scores as low as 20 percent on its entrance exam and has been described as the place where  you go when no one else will accept you.  The list of campuses goes on. You may inspect them here.Laureate decided to go public again in fall 2015. It filed to convert to a Delaware-based public benefit corporation for an initial public offering (IPO) in which it disclosed $4.7 billion in debt, probably hoping that the IPO would erase some of this crushing debt burden. With friends like the Clintons, how can it lose? If Laureate continues to grow, it will expand to the US market, and there will be no way to stop it when it does.Imagine, if you will, a Laureate bid for Brandeis University (which was in the red after Bernie Madoff squandered its endowment) or Wayne State University (where a city such as Detroit has gone bankrupt); imagine further the devaluation of every degree that these universities have granted. Now think of your school, suddenly insolvent, or your children s schools becoming parodies of educational institutions.Clinton has packed Laureate s board with people from his 1993-2001 administration, including his former Secretary of Education, Richard W. Riley; his former Secretary of Housing and development, Henry Cisneros; and his former head of the US Information Agency, Joseph Duffey.Quite apart from the fact that the Clintons and their associates appear to have set up a for-profit education scam to dwarf all others, they also seem to have established an entity that can grow their wealth, finance their political campaigns on the sly, grease the wheels wherever needed, and indefinitely keep them in power regardless of voter choice.All of it has been done so far on the backs of the world s aspiring poor, with the collusion of their governments and pretext of improving their lot. This is the way of the Clintons and their rich friends.*** Dady Chery is the author of We Have Dared to Be Free.

23318,The Genealogy of Trump’s U-Turn on Palestine,"Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireHas political reality finally set in for the GOP presumptive nominee Donald Trump?With only days before the Republican Party s National Convention at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, presidential candidate Donald J. Trump finally abandoned any pretence of  neutrality  on the Israel-Palestine issue, and is now firmly  committed  to supporting Israeli settlement expansion on territories it has seized illegally, and also not recognizing a Palestinian State.After all the promising rhetoric and previous displays of good will on this crucial foreign policy issue, exactly how did he finally arrive back at the status quo?What started off as interesting, became promising, before eventually settling into Washington s default position. On numerous past occasions during the GOP debate cycle and along the campaign trail, Trump had stated his feelings (which appeared to have an air of passion at the time) and intentions to secure a peace deal for the open-ended Israel-Palestine conflict.The Israeli Lobby started to get very interested in the beginning of December 2015, when during an interview with the AP, Trump seemed to blame Israel for not securing a lasting peace agreement. I have a real question as to whether or not both sides want to make it,  Trump said, before explaining that his concerns predominantly reside with  one side in particular [Israel].  He also hinted that he wasn t interested in any Jewish Republican money, to a chorus of boos he crowed,  I can t be bought . The same for any outside money too. Later, it slipped out again during a nationally televised GOP debate, with Trump making sounds about  negotiating a peace deal. Now here was a true maverick, giving chase to the forbidden cow. Amid all of Trump s wild gaffes and ad hominem attacks, this was an epiphany. At this moment Trump really stood out, and caught the attention   and support   of a whole new legion of disaffected, disenfranchised moderates paddling on the fringe of the Trump wave.That was it. Soon after the phone rang. It was Sheldon.The Donald had been summoned to a one-on-one in Las Vegas with the capo de capo himself, the George Soros of American right-wing politics, the kingmaker, Lord of the Slots and Supreme Master of Macau, billionaire property, casino tycoon and CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corporation, 82 yr old Sheldon Adelson. It was after this time that Trump began to shape-shift on the issue, and not in favor of the Palestinians either.  CAPO de CAPO? Donald Trump and Sheldon AdelsonAdelson, a committed Zionist who has backed numerous successful political careers, including that of Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, commented on his meeting with the Republican candidate,  He [Trump] had talked about potentially dividing about Jerusalem and Israel, so I talked about Israel because with our newspaper, my wife being Israeli, we are the few who know more about Israel than people who don t. From that point on, began the process of Trump s  rehabilitation  on the Israel-Palestine.On March 10, 2016, there stood Trump, still as the presumptive underdog, at CNN s GOP Debate in Miami   alongside a wall of Republicans candidates who were all firmly in the pockets of the Israel lobby including their emissaries in the US Senate   Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Trump s remarks on the illusive peace process could have been considered seminal way back then: I would like to at least have the other side think I m somewhat neutral as to them, so that we can maybe get a deal done. Campaign rival Cruz hit back, questioning Trump s support for Israel saying,  I don t think we need a commander in chief who is neutral between the Palestinian terrorists and one of our strongest allies in the world, the nation of Israel. Everyone, including the media, seemed so shocked by Trump s unorthodox comments that they went near catatonic on this issue afterwords. It was as if Trump had pole-vaulted over the perennial swamp that is the GOP foreign policy platform. The Lobby didn t waste any time however. In the eyes of the wider Israeli Lobby, taking a  neutral  stance or daring to recognize Palestine or Palestinians, is synonymous with attacking Israel and Jews. This is a simple law of political physics in America at the moment and will remain so as long as the lobbyists continue shoveling millions of dollars per month into the pockets of both prospective candidates and elected officials nationwide.Predictably, he was attacked viciously by his opponents, especially Cruz. It seemed as if Trump has broken ranks in a way that was unfathomable for any Republican politician seeking office in the United States of America.Of course, the Israeli press didn t take kindly to Trump s vision of peace and harmony, and from this point onward, pressure began to mount on Trump to conform to the American political orthodoxy on this issue.Soon, Trump was summoned on March 21st, to AIPAC, the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, where he delivered a resounding speech which seemed good enough for the lobby that night, but the job wasn t finished just yet.Later on in May, Trump continued to evolve, now employing doublespeak on the issue, saying he would still like to negotiate  a deal  but that Israel should keep building illegal settlements in the West Bank of Palestine, and that Israel needs to  keep going  and  keep moving forward.  He stated: I d love to negotiate peace. I think that, to me, is the all-time negotiation I would love to see if peace could be negotiated. A lot of people say that s not a deal that s possible. But I mean lasting peace, not a peace that lasts for two weeks and they start launching missiles again. So we ll see what happens. I think Israel should have   they really have to keep going. They have to keep moving forward [with constructing illegal settlements]. Finally, the penny ultimately dropped. With the GOP s Big Tent event rapidly approaching, Trump s platform on Israel has been fully baked. Sputnik News reports: David M. Friedman, a real-estate attorney serving as Trump s main advisor on Israel, said the Republican presidential candidate and reality television star would not support the recognition of the Palestinian state without  the approval of the Israelis.  Friedman also remarked that Trump was unconcerned with the inhabitants of the West Bank, because  nobody really knows how many Palestinians live there. Trump made Friedman a part of his campaign staff in April, at a meeting with Orthodox Jews, naming him and Jason Greenblatt, another real-estate lawyer and Trump s chief attorney, as his advisors on Israel. Friedman said at the time,  Mr. Trump s confidence is very flattering. My views on Israel are well known, and I would advise him in a manner consistent with those views. America s geopolitical interests are best served by a strong and secure Israel, with Jerusalem as its undivided capital.  Friedman has made no secret of his feelings about a two-state solution with Palestine, writing that,  It was never a solution, just an illusion that served both the US and the Arabs. Another devastating blow to the native Palestinians, currently under military occupation   and backed by the US to the tune of $3 billion per year in direct military aid (free money for weapons and equipment).Against his former declarations to the contrary, Trump is also now accepting outside money, from multiple sources. Funny how the political poles shift. How quickly a raging populist becomes a cynical realist. Even for a self-made billionaire, money still buys friends and influence.With that out of the way, it s finally safe for the lobby to get behind Donald in a general election, should they wish to.There it is.

23319,"MISSING DETAILS: Orlando Shooting 911 Transcripts Questioned, Survivor’s Story Challenged","Shawn Helton 21st Century Wire The FBI have finally released the written transcripts from shooter Omar Mateen s supposed 911 call   and now apparently unredacted. Meanwhile, another story of survival at Pulse nightclub is called into question.Will this tell us anything new about this event, or will it just prompt even more questions? NIGHT OF TERROR?   A serene setting following the Orlando shooting attack on June 11th (Image Source: twitter)Shaky Storyline, Missing DetailsWhile the focus on Orlando shooter Omar Mateen s 911 transcripts is over what was included and what was not, and while the national media argue endlessly over the need for more gun control in the US   the most important aspect of the FBI supplied transcript seems to have gone virtually unnoticed. There s no discussion of an actual shooting occurring inside of the Pulse nightclub.While the report has a basic outline of  America s largest mass shooting  it fails to account for any of the shootings said to have occurred within the Pulse nightclub, with no mention of individuals being shot at or reportedly shot at in the FBI s official narrative. It s as if they just left out the biggest piece of the puzzle.This has become an all to common theme, as media press conference rituals shape a narrative within the first hours of a mass casualty event and even if that story turns out to be mostly false, the media runs with it anyway, whether or not law enforcement information and crime scene analysis belies the original narrative pushed by media. The most clear example of this happened during the aftermath of the WTC 1993 bombing, where major media outlets exposed it as an FBI run sting with their operators in control   yet still, media anchors called it an al-Qaeda led attack.So when you consider what happened in Orlando, one should question the lack of shooting details- why is this aspect of the story left open for interpretation when every other part of the official timeline appears to be accounted for?While the media conveniently overlook this important detail, the implications of this could be very significant in determining who shot who, and when.Interestingly, the description of the Orlando shooting even includes mention of the Orlando Police Department pulling an air conditioning unit out of a Pulse  dressing room  to evacuate victims, a multi-call crisis negotiation, the alleged shooter s outrageous claims of a  bomb-laced vest  and authorities breaching the back wall of the nightclub with an explosive charge   and yet, no mention of additional shots fired at patrons inside the club?Here s a portion of the FBI s summary of events that excludes any mention of shots fired within the interior of the club itself: Based on OPD radio communications, there were no reports of shots being fired inside Pulse between the initial exchange of gunfire between responding officers and shooter, and the time of the final breach. During this time, the shooter communicated with an OPD 911 operator and an OPD crisis negotiator, and OPD radio communications reported that victims were being rescued. Here s a more basic chronology of the Orlando shooting, as told by the FBI: 2:02 a.m.: OPD call transmitted multiple shots fired at Pulse nightclub. 2:04 a.m.: Additional OPD officers arrived on scene. 2:08 a.m.: Officers from various law enforcement agencies made entrance to Pulse and engaged the shooter. 2:18 a.m.: OPD SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) initiated a full call-out. 2:35 a.m.: Shooter contacted a 911 operator from inside Pulse.3:03 a.m.: Second crisis negotiation call occurred lasting approximately 16 minutes. 3:24 a.m.: Third crisis negotiation call occurred lasting approximately three minutes.4:21 a.m.: OPD pulled an air conditioning unit out of a Pulse dressing room window for victims to evacuate.4:29 a.m.: As victims were being rescued, they told OPD the shooter said he was going to put four vests with bombs on victims within 15 minutes.5:02 a.m.: OPD SWAT and OCSO Hazardous Device Team began to breach wall with explosive charge and armored vehicle to make entry.5:14 a.m.: OPD radio communication stated that shots were fired. 5:15 a.m.: OPD radio communication stated that OPD engaged the suspect and the suspect was reported down. The Orlando shooting details state multiple shots [were] fired at Pulse nightclub at 2:02 am, as Additional OPD officers arrived on scene,  at 2:04 am, with law enforcement engaging the shooter at 2:08 am   there is no other mention of shots fired until police exchange fire with the alleged suspect after breaching the wall at 5:15 am.Question: Would it really be possible for Mateen to have accurately shot over 100 people, take hostages and engage in a fire fight with officers in just a 6 minute time frame?This scenario is hardly likely, if not impossible.Additionally, what happened during the apparent crisis negotiation from 3:24 am to 4:21 am, why have the FBI chosen not to elaborate on those details?Matten s weapons of choice during the apparent attack were a Sig Sauer MCX .223 caliber rifle and a Glock 17 9mm semi-auto pistol    and according to the official story, was far more accurate than most well-trained law enforcement agents, defying statistical averages as examined by the Rand Corporation.Let s take another look at the extensive Rand study involving the NYPD, here are the following statistics as it relates they firearm accuracy: According to a 2008 Rand Corporation study evaluating the New York Police Department s firearm training, between 1998 and 2006, the average hit rate during gunfights was just 18 percent . When suspects did not return fire, police officers hit their targets 30 percent of the time.Another aspect of the Orlando shooting attack was the possibility that many club goers could have been injured by authorities, something that also seemed to be absent from the official story. Here s a passage from WFAA8, an ABC affiliate discussing this point: Orlando Police Chief John Mina and other law enforcement officers offered new details about the shooting, including the possibility that some victims may have been killed by officers trying to save them. I will say this, that s all part of the investigation,  Mina said.  But I will say when our SWAT officers, about eight or nine officers, opened fire, the backdrop was a concrete wall, and they were being fired upon. Police also used an explosive charge and a Bearcat armored vehicle to breach the wall as civilians were allegedly holed up in a bathroom. This has led some critics to consider the possibility that non-combatants could have become collateral damage during the SWAT siege at Pulse.Political Fallout & Media EngineeringAlso of note regarding the Orlando shooting event, was the obvious attempt to ramrod new ready-made gun legislation (struck down just two days ago)   just over a week after the incident.Back in November of 2012, it was reported that the White House, along with other Democrats were already busy rewriting old gun-ban legislation just prior to the Sandy Hook shooting. The Assault Weapons Ban and Law Enforcement Protection Act of 2007, otherwise known as H.R. 1022 of the 110th Congress, it introduced an early list of gun-bans and restrictions but was dropped due to lack of public support. A similar set of laws failed after the Oregon campus shooting in 2015.While big media has been busy trying to sell the public on the most tragic shooting in America. They ve also been attempting to fill in a series of unexplainable blanks by seemingly re-writing the Orlando narrative, with a wave of contradictory information. In essence, the corporate media has boiled down two choices in the motive for the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting   suggesting it s either a hate crime or terrorism.And since then it s become problematic to blend certain elements of the official story in the Orlando shooting case, prompting Attorney General Loretta Lynch to state the motive may never be known in the alleged crime   after key aspects of the 911 transcript were redacted and a decision was made to block audio from the 911 call.No motive, no audio, redacted transcripts and conflicting reports of the shooting, isn t that convenient.The whole episode immediately recalls the much fabled death of Bin Laden and the political and media fiasco that followed the Abbotabad raid in Pakistan   all of which failed to reveal any real forensic evidence, as President Obama withheld post-mortem images of Bin Laden, including  video  of the sea burial of the purported terror leader.The fact is, none of the media s grandstanding or politicized hyperbole has offered anything in terms of actual evidence   as the public has been deliberately steered towards multiple storylines   while politicians go through another gun control/gun reform ritual on the Senate floor.  QUIET EMERGENCY?    A calm scene at Orlando Regional Medical Center hospital prior to apparent Pulse nightclub victims arriving for medical attention. (Image Source: twitter)Orlando s Staged Elements & False ClaimsRecently here at 21WIRE, we discussed much of the corporate media s theatrical depiction of the Orlando shooting and the widespread characterization of the event, which has been reduced to two categories   that of a  lone gunman  and a saddened community centered on the sociopolitical ramifications of the incident, rather than an in-depth forensic analysis of the alleged crime itself.In addition, we outlined some of the various Hollywood and media connections observed in the aftermath of the apparent Orlando shooting attack, as it was revealed that the world s largest security firm G4S, who had employed the man named in the Orlando pulse nightclub shooting, Omar Mateen  is also client of the mass casualty and crisis actor staging company called CrisisCast.As if that wasn t enough, we re also now being told that alleged Pulse nightclub  survivor  Clint Lampkin s account of the shooting has been called into question by media. The following is a YouTube clip from Wochit news reviewing the inconsistencies found by the CBS-affiliated television station WHNT-TV The following was released by FOX6 on June 21st, examining WHNT-TV s findings over the weekend that have since been removed from the network s website: On Saturday, hundreds of people in Alabama were captivated by an impromptu speech by Clint Lampkin, a man who claimed to be a survivor of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando. I was in the bar when it all happened,  Lampkin told the crowd at the Rocket City Pride Memorial Service in Huntsville.  It s been hard on me  seeing people get shot. Lampkin said the hate he witnessed first-hand is still overwhelming. It s really strong. I mean not just for my friend but all the others that lost their lives. It s hard you know. It really is. It s really sad,  Lampkin says.Continuing, the recently published article outlined the contradictory nature of Lampkin s comments made during a memorial service and a Facebook post on his personal account on the morning after the shooting:(Left side screen shot of Lampkin s strange comment after the Orlando attack) But now, Lampkin s story is being called into question.One of Lampkin s Facebook friends sent WHNT a screenshot of one of Lampkin s Facebook posts from June 12, which shows he shared the story about the shooting and wrote:  Glad I wasn t at that one. Lampkin told WHNT his Facebook account was  hacked  and that he never made that post. He still claims he was at the Pulse Nightclub the night of the shooting. I have really bad anxiety attacks, so I just kinda, I don t know, my mind is just gone,  he told WHNT.WHNT asked for other details surrounding the night of the shooting, and Lampkin gave the same response   that the trauma he witnessed has somehow erased his memory and made it difficult to remember the name of the friend who was allegedly shot dead: I did lose a friend that got shot,  he told the crowd on Saturday. WHNT asked Lampkin for the name of his friend who died inside the club. He answered that he had only known each other for a short time and didn t remember the victim s name.  Lampkin s Facebook profile states that he s an associate at Tobacco Warehouse and a cashier at Arby s. CEO of Free2Be and organizer of the Rocket City Pride Memorial Service, James Robinson, has subsequently fielded calls claiming Lampkin s story is untrue.This again has become another unexplained and unresolved aspect in the Orlando shooting event.Rehearsal Drills Train the PublicThe staging of inter-agency drills often precedes an area stricken by a tragic event. Here at 21WIRE, we ve documented a number of drills taking place in the days, months, years, in a nearby city leading up to a dramatic mass casualty incident.As we previously reported Orlando s Orange County had been running a number of  mass casualty  drills in recent years.As stated before, these emergency response drills often take place prior to a real-life active-shooter scenario. The Orlando Sentinel reported the drill on October 2nd, 2015, one day after the Oregon shooting, an event that also saw drills prior to a shooting at Umpqua Community College. Here s a passage of the Sentinel s report: During the Emergency Nurses Association s annual meeting on Friday, a mock shooter blew himself up, killing and injuring 100 local volunteer actors. There was blood, screams and moans, wounds and dead people   all fake   to create a realistic training environment for more than 40 nurses who had signed up for the exercise.They quickly began tending to  patients,  assessing the extent of their injuries. The  NBC-affiliated WESH2 in Orlando stated that  Nurses attending to mock patients knew they were in for a drill, but they had no idea it would be a mass casualty/active shooter test. Was the Pulse nightclub shooting a drill gone live, with both real and unreal elements?  HEAVY MAKE-UP    In another plot twist, an alleged ex-lover of Mateen s named  Miguel  has re-energized the hate crime narrative pushed by media.(Image Source: xaluan)According left-leaning latin American broadcast TV outlet Univision: Omar Mateen, the Muslim gunman who committed the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando, was  100 percent  gay and bore a grudge against Latino men because he felt used by them, according to a man who says he was his lover for two months. I ve cried like you have no idea. But the thing that makes me want to tell the truth is that he didn t do it for terrorism. In my opinion he did it for revenge,  he told Univision Noticias anchor Maria Elena Salinas in an exclusive interview in English and Spanish on Tuesday. He said Mateen was angry and upset after a man he had sex with later revealed he was infected with the HIV virus.Asked why he decided to come forward with his story, he said:  It s my responsibility as a citizen of the United States and a gay man. The man said he had approached by the FBI and been interviewed three times in person by agents. Univision was unable to independently verify his account. The FBI confirmed to Univision that it had met with him. Suddenly, the alleged shooter Omar Mateen is a gay lover scorned, and not an ISIS-inspired terrorist? Note here that  Miguel  could be seen wearing a very expensive, complex Hollywood-level make-up facade, and one could easily deduce here that  Miguel  is an actor of sorts, if not a professional.It should also be noted that Univision, who collaborate heavily with CNN on a number of sensational and politicized stories, led the way in spoiling the crime scene of the alleged shooter Omar Mateen s apartment in Orlando   accessing his property and fiddling with the suspects belongs on camera only days after the Pulse nightclub event. This media segment was clearly staged, not least of all because at that time law enforcement announced they were conducting a  terrorism  and mass-murder investigation. If that were the case, then the suspect s home would have been classed as a crime scene and its contents considered as evidence.Judging by Univision s immediate media access to the property, it should be fairly obvious, as it was after the exact same San Bernardino media fiasco last December, that the apartment would not have been deemed a real crime scene in an international or domestic terrorism investigation. Watch: For over a week, the public has been drip fed information about the Orlando shooting attack   much of which has led to even more questions. To major media, the event is all but a forgone conclusion tightly wrapped up with all the fear-inducing talking points on both the left and right side of the political aisle without clearly looking at the alleged crime itself.In fact it seems, that the media has sought to draw the viewer away from the incomplete Pulse nightclub story line, a narrative that as of yet   has failed to explain the connection of a crisis staging company (CrisisCast) to that of the alleged shooter s security company (G4S), as well as many Hollywood/acting/media connections discovered, such as Luis Burbano, Shawn Royster Santiago, Patience Carter, Omar Mateen, Francesca Hunt and Brian Mitchell   add to that, those who witnessed multiple shooters or any shooting within the interior of the nightclub, in addition to the mismatched tweets and Facebook posts that displayed inaccurate time frames or cult of personality types such as Clint Lampkin, whose story just doesn t add up.We re now told that the FBI is continuing to build a timeline of Mateen s whereabouts before the attack, stating he paid for entry at Pulse then subsequently disappeared for a two-hour period between when he left the club and returned. It s anyone s guess what will be next in the Orlando shooting story.END OF PART 3Stay tuned for more Orlando shooting updates SEE ALSO: CASTING CRISIS: Orlando s Actors, Agents and Casualty Role PlayersREAD MORE ORLANDO SHOOTING NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Orlando FilesHelp support us by becoming a 21WIRE Member at: 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"June 22, 2016"
23320,Trump Attacks Hillary: “She is a world class liar!”,"21st Century Wire says Trump has begun his war on Hillary.Today, Donald Trump presented a full length speech attacking Hillary Clinton.Trump called on Sanders supporters to join in supporting him, saying that he too is interested in removing special interests from American politics and is also not a political insider.The presidential candidate went on to attack Hillary for making speeches to banking elites and refusing to release their content for public critique.In what may be shocking to some, Trump also advocated a policy of protectionism, through trade tariffs, to protect American jobs and industry, while savaging Hillary for being a massive promoter of  free trade  deals.Here are some of Trump s striking lines from the speech, which you can watch in full below: Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and even theft. We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism, to a policy of globalism   focusing on how to make money for large corporations. She believes she is entitled to the office. She gets rich making you poor. It s not just our economy that s been corrupted, but our foreign policy too. The Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives, trillions of dollars, and unleashed ISIS across the world. Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched. In 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world. Libya was cooperating, Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence, Syria was under control, ISIS wasn t even on the map. https://youtu.be/xUW2-MUonbo?t=35m6s .

23321,Black Student ‘Activist’ Jailed for Tweeting FAKE Racist Threats,"21st Century Wire says What a twisted world we have become.A female, black student activist, Kayla McKelvey (image below), has been jailed for tweeting racially charged threats directed at events that she, herself, was organising and attending. She essentially employed the  false flag attack  model, where one claims to be under attack from another, who in actual fact has nothing to do with it, to further an agenda.The so-called  activist  pleaded guilty to causing false public alarm, but claimed the tweets  were meant to raise awareness of racism on campus .One wonders how much racism there really is on campus, if someone has to deliberately go out of their way to create fake racial threats. This then raises the questions, what exactly did McKelvey hope to achieve by creating a  threat  to black people on campus?The threats caused Kean University to shell out $80,000 in additional security costs, costs that McKelvey will now be forced to repay after her 90 days behind bars.Such actions do absolutely nothing to  raise awareness of racism , and only further racial divides. If we stop seeing race altogether, and instead see humanity, we can really solve the problem.Get 10% off a 21WIRE TV membership package today using promo code: STU21WIRETVMORE ON ERODING WESTERN  CULTURE : 21st Century Wire Culture Files",Middle-east,"June 18, 2016"
23322,"CASTING CRISIS: Orlando’s Actors, Agents and Casualty Role Players","Shawn Helton 21st Century WireTruth is often stranger than fiction when looking at the bizarre phenomena surrounding many mass casualty incidents   and the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting was no exception.It was recently revealed that the world s largest security firm G4S, who had employed the man named in the Orlando pulse nightclub shooting, Omar Mateen  is a client of the mass casualty staging company called CrisisCast.  STAGING REALITY    CrisisCast specializes in replicating mass casualty events. (Screen Capture from Crisis Cast)Training for DisasterThe heavily-stylized company CrisisCast, appears to be a revamped version of the Visionbox Crisis Actors project (a crisis actor production emerging after Sandy Hook), with a professional team of actors, elaborate film crews, expert producers and theatrical effects makeup squads mimicking real-life injuries (additional prosthetics)   all focused to deliver a simulated crisis-like reality to the public, later to be managed accordingly through their public relations division via various forms of social media.RELATED: (VIDEO)  Active Shooter  and  Terror  Drills: The Truth WILL Shock YouIn CrisisCast s  about  section we see a sophisticated amalgam of emergency protocol disaster training combined with  internationally credited film crews,  that bring their high-end stagecraft to life, through a collection of  role players, stunts, medical simulations and combat flashpoints, cloaked in visual tricky, with film techniques out of the UK and Australia, so says the group s website.Below is a road traffic collusion demo created by lead CrisisCast producer/founder Brian Mitchell (has worked on Hollywood studios and holds National security clearance) featured on Vimeo. The scenario is filmed from multiple angles, with quick cut editing that disorients, as we see an individual (crisis actor) in the aftermath of a crash   struck by the emotional weight of the scene   screaming out to a gaggle of onlookers after witnessing the staged carnage. The strange episode leaves one with a feeling of phantom trauma that continues to lurk.When recreating large scale mass casualty incidents, Cast may also make use of  pyrotechnics, wardrobe, special effects, covert and aerial footage,  depending on the clients needs.In a passage from their  solutions  section, an outline to basic formatting for a simulated crisis is revealed: Our producers work with your trainers to create a  script  that enables the role play actors to know when to trigger key developments in an evolving crisis management scenario. We brief and rehearse the team   where possible on location   but at least with video surveillance footage.Heads of department manage each discipline and report to the lead producer who is your direct contact at all times. In addition to stage-managing a crisis scenario with a highly fluid production team, Cast also centers its strategy on  lockdown and evacuation procedures, [with] the ability of emergency services to co-operate,   and the ever important task of having the  joint ability to respond to the press,  in a partnership with the company s clients through a multitude of social media platforms on the internet.

From CrisisCast to Hollywood Also featured on Cast s website, Francesca Hunt (Professional actress and lead producer and co-founder of CrisisCast), explaining why  authentic  stress behaviors are so important when recreating a crisis. . According unitedagents.co.uk, Hunt herself is a theater trained actress, having studied at Oxford (1983-86) graduate, Bristol Old Vic (1987-89) and Moscow Arts Theatre 1989. She has been featured in several Hollywood films such as  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), Strathblair (1992) and A Prince Among Men (1997) on her IMDB page.

Most notably, a short interview in a major Hollywood designer documentary called The Big Fix in 2012, discussing the BP oil spill at Deep Water Horizon.Mateen at the 36 minute mark, played the part of a concerned security guard, taking on a scripted activist-type character revealing that  everybody is out to get paid,  and that  they want more disaster to happen, cuz that s where there money making is  even though he was currently working for the world s largest security contractor overseeing the apparent environmental crisis.Indeed, Mateen was also featured in another documentary called Love City Jalalabad (2013), a feature supposedly depicting progressive Afghani youth and a quest for social change, created by the abstract artist/filmmaker George Gittoes, whose works delve into the holographic and hyperreal, as he was also said to be a former collaborator with the famed screen print legend Andy Warhol and holographic pioneer physicist Zoltan Hegedus (hat-tip 21WIRE contributor Randy Johnson).Gittoes has a background in politically charged propaganda films, with him  [Creating a] series of works including The Hotel Kennedy Suite and The Kent State Suite responding to events in the United States, including anti-Vietnam War protests and the Kent State shootings at Kent State University, Ohio,  in 1970.Additionally, during a time of great upheaval, Gittoes  [traveled] to Bosnia (April May) on a privately sponsored trip to document United Nations- monitored elections. Produces series of paintings based on the people of Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and documents the effects of the 1992 96 Bosnian War for independence, the longest siege of a city in the history of modern warfare. Gittoes then traveled to Iraq four times between March 2003 and May 2004, making a trilogy of films based on The War On Terror.Comparatively, in an article written by Jay Dyer of Jay s Analysis we re reminded of other connections with intelligence agencies and Hollywood. Here s a passage where Dyer observes historical links between the CIA and Hollywood, through the former CIA general counsel: Author John Rizzo has recently published a book titled Company Man: Thirty Years of Controversy and Crisis in the CIA, which is an amazing admission of this scandalous affair between intelligence and the film industry.  The L.A. Times comments: The CIA has long had a special relationship with the entertainment industry, devoting considerable attention to fostering relationships with Hollywood movers and shakers studio executives, producers, directors, big-name actors,  John Rizzo, the former acting CIA general counsel, wrote in his new book,  Company Man: Thirty Years of Crisis and Controversy in the CIA.The CIA also recruits actors to give more visibility to propaganda projects abroad, such as a documentary secretly produced by the agency, Rizzo said. And the agency sometimes takes advantage of the door-opening cachet that movie stars and other American celebrities enjoy. A star who met a world leader, for example, might be asked for details about that meeting.The CIA has officials assigned full-time to the care and feeding of Hollywood assets, Rizzo wrote.  Other former CIA officials added that some of those operatives work in the Los Angeles office of an agency department called the National Resources Division, which recruits people in the U.S. to help America spy abroad. Through the connections above, were also reminded of the alleged Orlando shooter s father, Seddique Mateen, who is closely tied to some of the most powerful leaders and agencies in Washington DC. Here s a passage from a recent 21WIRE report discussing a deeper intelligence connection with the Mateen family: Omar Mateen, worked as a contractor for the US Department of Homeland Security, then we learned that the elder Mateen is also standing to run for President of Afghanistan and is allied with the Taliban leadership   an absolutely ideal profile for a Washington-managed, CIA controlled-opposition political candidate.

The media script seems already written before the killer is even named.Crisis Actors    Agents of Change Here Peekay Truth shows a video depicting strange elements surrounding the Orlando shooting The  dancing actor  clip depicted above is reminiscent of the October drill said to have taken place during the Canadian Parliament shooting in 2014, where many wondered why police and security services were seen laughing and joking supposedly in the midst of a serious tragedy. As Seen on TV : Orlando s Acting Professionals Additionally, there was a Pulse nightclub goer seen immediately making the media rounds on TV following the dramatic shooting event, one Luis Burbano, an actor/model featured in a few Hollywood films, according to his IMDB bio.Here s a YouTube clip featuring Burbano s media appearance   One of the Orlando shooting survivors has admitted to locking an exit door, putting dozens of revelers  lives at risk during the massacre.The revelations about Luis Burbano s actions the night of the shooting have come to light after he gave an interview, saying he  regrets  his second chance at life.Nearby, he saw people moving through a small  employee s only  door hidden behind a curtain, and followed after. On the other side of the door was a narrow hallway where Burbano estimates about 20 people were crawling over each other to get to the exit at the other end. Burbano says he decided to shut the door behind him because the hallway was getting dangerously overcrowded. Here s another out-of-town Pulse club goer, Shawn Royster Santiago, from New York City, who apparently witnessed the shooting and who also happens to have a media/acting and modeling pedigree as well.According to Santiago s ModelMayhem profile it states, [I ve been] modeling and performing in the entertainment industry off and on since i was 11,  having appeared in a variety of projects such as Television/Commercials,  and he currently works as a  Visual Merchandiser.

Watch this YouTube clip from Now the Truth, to see her role in the Orlando story  Here s a review of some previously covered anomalies here at 21WIRE As we previously reported, though the Orlando shooting attack was officially stated to have been carried out around 2am, The Daily Mail published Facebook posts from people apparently inside the club that contradict the main timeline, suggesting the shooting happened much earlier.Here are the Facebook comments featured in the Daily Mail  for review If these time stamps are correct and the posts have not been doctored in any way, then these posts present a pretty major crack in the official timeline of events at Pulse nightclub.Here s another clip with the animated YouTube personality Peekay Truth outlining the Daily Mail time discrepancy associated with the Orlando shooting The UK s Independent published an article displaying an eyewitness account that directly contradicts the lone gunman theory pushed by all major media outlets in the aftermath of the shooting: Police did not immediately name the gunman or provide a possible motive for the attack but officials have classified the rampage as a  domestic terrorism incident , Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said.Javer Antonetti, 53, told the Orlando Sentinel newspaper he was near the back of the dance club when he heard gunfire.

While the stress of the incident could account for some differences, forensically it s hard to believe Mateen would have been able to have the ability to shoot over hundred people with only 50 some shots.According to multiple eyewitness accounts people inside the club mentioned that there was possibly as many as four shooters in and around the area. The witness seen in the image just below described the following: Then he [Mateen] called someone he knew and he mentioned that he was the fourth shooter, and there were three others. One of the main mainstream media protagonists from the Orlando Shooting event was a man named Chris Hansen, an aspiring actor and entertainer who played a central role as  survivor  and  hero  in a number of heavily rotated media clips depicting the aftermath of the event.

Fake Trauma & Staged Casualty Drills Back in March, 21WIRE also covered the suspicious Brussels airport attack, that coincidentally revealed a host of inter-agency mass casualty drills taking place on the global stage: In October of 2015, SputnikNews reported massive NATO drills in Belgium and other member countries: On October 21, the largest NATO military exercises in 13 years moved into an active phase testing threat response. The drills involve over 36,000 troops from 30 NATO and partner countries. The first phase of the Trident Juncture drills began October 3, running for two weeks in Canada, Norway, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. The second part is taking place in southern Europe   Spain, Italy, and Portugal   as well as in the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. Similarly, in February, The Daily Mail published an article reporting  Europe s largest-ever disaster response training exercise : Police, firefighters and paramedics will this week work side-by-side with more than 70 partner agencies including local councils, utility companies and specialist search and rescue teams to respond to the disaster during the four-day drill.Disaster victim identification teams from all UK police regions are also working alongside other forensic specialists in a mortuary on site.Teams will also be working alongside firefighters from Italy, Hungary and Cyprus who will also be mobilised to the incident on Wednesday.Although this scenario is not a terrorist attack, we will be practising procedures and systems that are common to any emergency that results in a large number of fatalities and injuries.

SELFIE OBSESSED SHOOTER    Omar Mateen is the alleged Orlando nightclub shooter (Image Source: nbcnews)QUESTION: Is this is another, in a long line of  Daily Shooter  events designed to evoke an emotive, polarized and highly politicized response, rather than a rational and reasoned one?The Orlando ShootingIn the early hours of Sunday, June 12th, Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, also listed as Omar Mateen by media outlets, was said to have killed 49 people, wounding some 53 others at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in what is being described as the deadliest mass shooting in America.According reports, Mateen is also said to have pledged allegiance to ISIS via a 911 call while carrying out the apparent large scale mass shooting and hostage situation, having been utterly cool and calm  as suggested by some larger media outlets upon finishing his rampage.RELATED: (VIDEO)  Active Shooter  and  Terror  Drills: The Truth WILL Shock YouAdditionally, Mateen, was first stated to have used an AR-15 rifle, along with a small handgun (legally obtained through two security licenses). However, reports later changed and updated the alleged shooter s weapons of choice to the Sig Sauer MCX .223 caliber rifle and a Glock 17 9mm semi-auto pistol.The following is an extensive Rand Corporation evaluation of the NYPD and it reveals the following statistics as they relate to firearm accuracy: According to a 2008 Rand Corporation study evaluating the New York Police Department s firearm training, between 1998 and 2006, the average hit rate during gunfights was just 18 percent . When suspects did not return fire, police officers hit their targets 30 percent of the time.21WIRE, was able to track down an individual trained in all types of firearm training, who also questioned the alleged shooter s ability to to be so accurate, confirming the study above.Continuing the Orlando shooting timeline We were then told Mateen, took club goers hostage while carrying out the alleged terror related shooting around 2am.The shooting occurred at Pulse nightclub a popular LGTB venue, was thought to have had some 300 people inside of the club during the time of the shooting. We ve also been told that authorities were unable to stop the gunman for until 3 hours after the initial attack.The Washington Post reported: Three hours after Mateen first began shooting, they breached the building   detonating an explosion on an exterior wall and ramming it with an armored vehicle. Traumatized club-goers escaped into the night, and then the gunman appeared in the opening, heavily armed and seemingly ready for what is known in law enforcement as suicide by cop. While some 30 lives have said to have been saved, how many were injured due to the explosive charge set of by police during the breach?According to a timeline of events, police were able to notify 24 of the victims families just two hours after the shooting at 7:30 am. This appears to be a significant detail when you consider the meticulous nature of crime scene investigation, as detectives are tasked with the time consuming and often difficult process of properly identifying individuals.In the Orlando shooting case, there would have (particularly in this scenario) been great bodily harm and perhaps unrecognizable victims who may or may not have had proper ID (fake ID s) on their person during the shooting.There appears to be a lack of footage surrounding the shooting itself, rescue operations performed or bodies at the stated crime scene   extremely strange in the age of social media.  SHOW OF FORCE    A full-scale militarized response to the Pulse crime scene shooting. Did club goers become victims of friendly fire or was something else at play? (Image Source: radaronline)The Times Union stated the following after the Pulse nightclub shooting: Orlando police Chief John Mina says an extra officer was working at the Pulse nightclub in full uniform. The officer engaged with the shooter near an entrance. Additional officers entered, and engaged the suspect in another gunbattle. The shooter retreated to the bathroom.Mina says,  At that time we were able to save and rescue dozens and dozens of people and get them out of the club. Officers then secured everything, and the SWAT team was brought in. Mina says officers then set up for an explosive breach on the bathroom wall. Mina says he made the decision to breach the wall, which created a hole through which dozens of clubgoers were rescued. Then the suspect exited through the same hole, and engaged in another gunbattle with officers. Shooter Omar Mateen was then killed. Why do early reports state that police engaged with the suspect, prior to the gunman shooting anyone or reportedly calling 911   this appears to directly contradict the main media narrative?Additionally, by police Chief John Mina s admission, a fully uniformed officer was working at Pulse nightclub. While it is not that unusual for police be at or sometimes moonlight at clubs as security, the details of how and exactly when the shooting occurred remain partially obscured in mainstream media reports.While ISIS media arms and social media accounts reportedly praised the attack, there has been wide scale condemnation of the shooting the world over including the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation who discussed this horrible act,  but warned of political campaigning and self-serving agendas,  following the tragic events.Continuing the article stated the following:Saudi Arabia s  Interior Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Mansour al-Turki told The Associated Press in a text message Monday that Mateen first visited Saudi Arabia for 10 days in March 2011 and again a year later in March 2012 for eight days. Not since the San Bernardino shooting last December, has the public s perception been so arrested by a media-driven wave of hyperreality following what appears to be another confusing heavily coordinated incident, with an uncanny police and emergency response.Crime Scene Questions, Multiple Shooters WitnessedThough the Orlando shooting attack was officially stated to have been carried out around 2am, The Daily Mail published Facebook posts from people apparently inside the club that contradict the main timeline, suggesting the shooting happened much earlier.Here are the Facebook comments featured in the Daily Mail  for review If these time stamps are correct and the posts have not been doctored in any way, then these posts present a pretty major crack in the official timeline of events at Pulse nightclub.Here s the animated YouTube personality Peekay Truth outlining the Daily Mail time discrepancy associated with the Orlando shooting . The UK s Independent published an article displaying an eyewitness account that directly contradicts the lone gunman theory pushed by all major media outlets in the aftermath of the shooting: Police did not immediately name the gunman or provide a possible motive for the attack but officials have classified the rampage as a  domestic terrorism incident , Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said.

The witness seen in the image below described the following: Then he[Mateen] called someone he knew and he mentioned that he was the fourth shooter, and there were three others. The witness also stated that the alleged shooter may have called police or a news agency stating that America should stop their bombing campaign on ISIS. Security Background & Alleged AbuseThe 29-year old Mateen, an Afghani-American was located in Port St. Lucie, Florida, about 120 miles outside of Orlando. In 2013, Mateen was placed under a terror watch list for 10 months (interviewed two to three times by the FBI 2013-14) and had worked for one of the largest security firms in the US since 2007, G4S Secure Solutions, headquartered in Jupiter, Florida and formerly part of a CIA-linked government contractor and security firm, Wackenhut Corporation.G4S, as it turns out, was the very first  designated  and certified Department of Homeland Security (DHS) contractor and recently secured a $234 million dollar contract with the federal cabinet department. In addition to apparently providing security solutions for 90 percent of U.S. nuclear facilities,  G4S, according to border patrol sources has also been tasked with the transportation and release of illegal immigrants inside the interior of the United States.At least one of Mateen s roles with G4S, was to transport and provide security for prisoner youths in Florida. In 2012, G4S congratulated Mateen for five years of service according to a company newsletter.Zero Hedge reported the following concerning G4S: And this is where the Mateen-G4S link emerges: as JW reported previously, a security company contracted by the U.S. government is driving the OTMs from the Border Patrol s Tucson Sector where they were in custody to Phoenix, sources said. The firm is the abovementioned G4S, the world s leading security solutions group with operations in more than 100 countries and 610,000 employees. G4S has more than 50,000 employees in the U.S. and its domestic headquarters is in Jupiter, Florida. Mateen remained on staff to guard prisoners despite media reports that he harassed a co-worker and expressed hateful views in the workplace and was the subject of a federal investigation for terrorism between 2013-14 for some 10 months. According to reports, the FBI dropped the investigation after Mateen admitted to the work place harassment, adding that he was responding to harassment from others over his beliefs.Mateen is also stated to have previously worked at Martin Correctional Institution from 2006-07, prior to being featured in a short interview (as an actor?) in a major Hollywood designer documentary called The Big Fix in 2012, discussing the BP oil spill at Deep Water Horizon.Here  you can see Mateen at the 36 minute mark, taking what appears to be a quasi-albeit scripted activist-type stance, even though he works for the world s largest security contractor. Clearly, Mateen was acting in this  real  documentary.. What is the public to make of Mateen s own acting and film background as it relates to America s largest mass shooting   are we again seeing a clear link between Hollywood and military/security services?Indeed, Mateen has been featured in another documentary from 2013, called Love City Jalalabad, a feature supposedly depicting progressive Afghani youth and a quest for social change.Also According to Times Union: The security company that employed the Orlando nightclub gunman says it has no record of a co-worker s complaints that the shooter was angry, profane and threatened violence.The company, G4S, says in a statement Monday that it has no record of any complaint by Daniel Gilroy against Omar Mateen. Mateen died in a gun battle with police after a mass shooting that left 49 people. However, Gilroy has maintained that  Mateen began harassing him, sending as many as 20 or 30 text messages a day and more than a dozen phone messages. Gilroy said his employer, G4S, did not intervene. After Gilroy left G4S, according to the security firm: Gilroy told company officials in June 2015, shortly after he left the firm, that his co-workers were  good men and women that put in an honest day s work and genuinely like to work as a team and contribute. Further adding to confusion surrounding Mateen s character, Mateen s ex-wife Sitora Yusufiy, has publicly stated that she was abused during their brief marriage. (Photo Illustration by Shawn Helton @21WIRE)Return of the Daily ShooterDuring most of 2015 if you remember, there was a barrage of  active shooter  crimes seen domestically within the US as well as parts of Europe, with many of the apparent shooters already known to authorities.21WIRE dubbed 2015 The Year of the Daily Shooter, as string of unreal shooting events rippled across America, many of which took place over the summertime, bleeding over into the chill of fall.While the public was still trying to comprehend the shocking and questionable Charlie Hebdo Attacks in early January of 2015, things began heating up in early May, when it was reported that two  Islamic  gunmen allegedly opened fire outside of a cartoon  art  exhibition and alleged  free speech contest featuring provocative images of the Prophet Muhammad in Garland, Texas.While the incident was quickly labeled a  terror attack,  along with the vague and forensically undefined  ISIS inspired  tag for dramatic effect, reports stated that a pair of shooters, Elton Simpson (shadowed by a paid FBI informant) and Nadir Hamid Soofi, targeted a bizarre  Muhammad Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest  that was organized by the American Freedom Defense Initiative, led by anti-Islamic Israeli lobbyist, Pamela Geller.It was a staged event that clearly echoed the Charlie Hebdo story line, with the usual trial by social media  tweets suggesting guilt before all evidence was in.Within a short period of time following the suspicious events in Garland, it was revealed that Simpson, one of the alleged suspects in the Garland shooting, had been under the watchful eye of the FBI for nearly a decade and was in close contact with an undercover informant during that time, similarly outlining the intelligence-linked Kouachi Brothers who were implicated in the Charlie Hebdo incident.And just as the dust was settling after high profile shootings in the spring, we learned there was even more  Trouble in the Homeland  with yet another alleged terror inspired individual named Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez. As bizarre and conflicting reports emerged regarding a shooting on July 16th at a US Marine Corps strip mall recruitment center and a secure Navy Operational Support Center in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the focus of media coverage gave the false perception that people were shot within the mall area  out in the open. However, only 48 hours later, it was revealed that victims of the shooting event were actually shot and killed inside of a secure Navy Reserve Training facility. By then the national media narrative had already been disseminated and set into the minds of the public.As we ve said before, whether it s the  grafting  of an overseas terror based story line or the concept of a rogue patriot-like  lone wolf  persona, we see a psychic assault on the masses, one that could potentially convince the public into giving up their civil liberties.  CANDID CAMERA    Omar Mateen s father s(Seddique Mateen) media presence and Congressional/CIA company has caused quite a stir concerning the background of the Orlando shooter. Seddique posted Facebook pictures from last year featuring political connections and Reps. Charles Rangel, Dana Rohrabacher, and Ed Royce. (Image Source: buzzfeed) Similarly, during the aftermath of 2014 s Canadian Parliament shooting, here at 21WIRE, we outlined many of the primary markers used in certain terror related events and mass shootings.The incident like other events such as the Boston Bombing, Sandy Hook and other bizarre attacks in recent years, have often distorted public opinion, pushing the populace towards new security measures in the wake of heavily coordinated and stylized events.(Left Image: therightscoop) The suspected Parliament Hill and National War Memorial shooter Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, had the perfect  modus operandi  and r sum  to be an informant for either a law enforcement or intelligence agency.Historically, government operators have often made use of low-life criminals, and mentally disturbed individuals as part of a larger agenda   domestically and abroad: According to the Globe and Mail, Zehaf-Bibeau was already designated as a high risk traveller by the Canadian government s security services   who had also seized his passport. Could this be the reason why the shooter had snapped? Was he being targeted or being pressured into becoming an informant? Much was made of Zehaf-Bibeau s recent conversion to Islam, especially from the reactionary neoconservative tribe on Fox News, while those on the left called for tighter gun restrictions.We should make note of the formulaic scripting often seen following these kinds of events:  Alleged connections to terror or terror networks, as with security links   Suspect recently radicalized views on religion.   Sensational media projections bring in additional storylines for dramatic effect.   An unknown motive for the crime said to be committed   followed quickly by a  presumed  motive without evidence.   Politicians, law enforcement and media call the incident a  terror attack  before all evidence is reviewed.Time and time again, we ve seen this same choreographed narrative pushed by mass media and authorities  only to be exposed at a later date.Readers should refer to the  informant game we outlined in 2014 here at 21WIRE, which provided historical context about the FBI s confidential informant past, as it relates to the Orlando shooting: Human Rights Watch explains,  The 214-page report, Illusion of Justice: Human Rights Abuses in US Terrorism Prosecutions, examines 27 federal terrorism cases from initiation of the investigations to sentencing and post-conviction conditions of confinement. It documents the significant human cost of certain counter-terrorism practices, such as overly aggressive sting operations and unnecessarily restrictive conditions of confinement. The list of terror informants and puppets is as long as it is colorful, starting with the infamous  Underwear Bomber , who was allowed to travel to the US without a passport and was accompanied by an intelligence agent on his flight from Amsterdam to Detroit.Who can forget the FBI s ill-fated 1993 World Trade Center bombing attempt, where FBI handlers trained the driver and gave them explosives   and worst of all   stood by and watched as their sting subjects went ahead and detonated their concoction underneath the world s tallest building in New York City. Incidentally, after the 1993 attack, the FBI was said to have tried to  lure  Emad A. Salem, (played role in 1993 WTC bombing) a former Egyptian army officer who was a prized undercover operative back into a role as a confidential informant, with agents suggesting he should go into the Witness Protection Program. (Graphic: UK Column)Other recent FBI terror stooge/informant nightmares include:Tamerlan Tsarnaev (see his informant story here) Buford Rogers (see his informant story here) Jerad Miller (see his informant story here) Naji Mansour (see his informant story here) Quazi Mohammad Nafis (see his informant story here) Mohamed Osman Mohamud (see his informant story here) Timothy McVeigh (see his informant story here) Elton Simpson (see his informant story here)But how does this relate to the Orlando club shooting?Drills & Informants Shortly after the Pulse shooting attack it was revealed that Mateen had been attending services at a Mosque, meeting with a known FBI informant named Marcus Dwayne Robertson (image, left   who also played role in 1993 WTC bombing), a former US Marine turned bank robber turned radical imam. Here s this passage from Fox News describing Robertson s role: It is no coincidence that this happened in Orlando,  said a law enforcement source familiar with Robertson s history of recruiting terrorists and inciting violence. Mateen was enrolled in [Robertson s online] Fundamental Islamic Knowledge Seminary.Robertson and several associates were rounded up for questioning early Sunday, according to law enforcement sources, a development his attorney refused to confirm or deny. Another intriguing part of the Orlando shooter case was the fact that Orlando s Orange County had been running a number of  mass casualty  drills in recent years.For those unfamiliar, these Emergency response drills often take place prior to a real-life active-shooter scenario. The Orlando Sentinel reported in October 2nd, 2015, one day after the Oregon shooting, which also saw drills prior to the campus shooting at Umpqua Community College: During the Emergency Nurses Association s annual meeting on Friday, a mock shooter blew himself up, killing and injuring 100 local volunteer actors.There was blood, screams and moans, wounds and dead people   all fake   to create a realistic training environment for more than 40 nurses who had signed up for the exercise.They quickly began tending to  patients,  assessing the extent of their injuries.The nurses association had worked with several Orlando-based companies for nearly a year to set up the drill on at the Orange County Convention Center, which by coincidence took place a day after the shooting at a community college in Roseburg, Oregon, where 10 people died and seven were wounded. Branding Crisis(Left side)  HASHTAG FRENZY    Another huge hashtag campaign in less than 24 hours after a major attack. (Image Scource: heavy)While the apparent Orlando shooting attack on the surface appears to be another tragedy in America, one should take note at the breakneck speed at which media marketing campaigns have been rolled out globally since the violent incident, including ready-made hashtag slogans as reported by CBS news: Immediately after reports of the incident surfaced online, alarmed social media users began posting concerns and condolences under the hashtags #PrayForOrlando, #PrayersForOrlando, and #PulseShooting. Within hours of the Orlando shooting, many celebrities took to twitter to politicize and polarize the event before all the evidence had been properly reviewed.Media Hoaxing, Crisis Actors & Other AnomaliesThere have been many methods used to shutdown critical thinking in the aftermath of a crisis, as media organizations, politicians and celebrities are often used to misdirect the public s attention to detail.In an article entitled, Where Have All the Crisis Actors Gone? , written by Dr. James Tracy, we see a clear connection between forms of social media and law enforcement when a coordinated an  active-shooter  event is about to go live. Here s an excerpt below: Yet there may be much more to the Visionbox Crisis Actors project reverberating through the flurry of alleged shooting incidents taking place since the early 2010s. For example, Visionbox is proficient in using social media such as Facebook and Twitter to  broadcast  a catastrophic event to both participant  actors  and the public at large. In addition, the theatric entourage/ is also knowledgeable at  crowdsourcing, or monitoring how an event is relayed and interpreted through the body politic via Facebook, Twitter, and so on. In December 2012 Visionbox Crisis Actors produced a detailed 73-page syllabus,  Social Media in Emergency Management,  an instructional class foregrounding the central role of social media to coordinate and convey a catastrophic event. The YouTube channel Stranger than Fiction News displays media interview with an eyewitness Janiel Gonzales, who stated that there was another person preventing people from leaving Pulse nighclub.Additionally, the YouTube video montages another interview with a professional actor and model named Luis Burbano admitting he was blocking an exit at the time of the shooting . Here s another YouTube video from End Times Headline News, which raises important questions concerning the crime scene The Politics of Mass Shootings Like other mass shooting events, there appears to be deliberate attempt to radically manipulate public opinion following each major incident, the Orlando shooting is no exception. We ve already seen the Orlando shooting attack send political rivals Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton into campaign overdrive.This type of subliminal propaganda has become a doorway for all hot button socio-political issues including  gun control/reform  and for those concerned over  mental illness  background checks and security.Once again, the media plays a crucial role   not in informing and educating the public, or even investigating a crime, or questioning the state s methods and motives in any high-profile event.In 2015, The Washington Post published an article listing the apparent number of mass shootings in America. According to the  Mass Shooting Tracker  the definition of a mass-shooting event has been changed to include a larger number of shootings.However, perhaps the most glaring and obvious grandstanding seemed to occur in Obama s 2015  legacy  interview, as he expressed his inability to change gun laws during the course of his presidency. Here is an excerpt from the BBC interview: You mentioned the issue of guns, that is an area where if you ask me where has been the one area where I feel that I ve been most frustrated and most stymied it is the fact that the United States of America is the one advanced nation on earth in which we do not have sufficient common-sense, gun-safety laws. Even in the face of repeated mass killings.   FRAMING REALITY    Mateen s wife, Noor Salman and their young child. Reports suggest that Disneyland may have also been a target. (Image Scource: foxnews)Family DesignsUntil recently in media, there was almost no discussion of Mateen s current wife Noor Salman In 2013 Omar Mateen married Noor Zahi Salman and they reportedly have a 3-year-old son together.According to public records,  Noor Zahi Salman, age 30, has scrubbed her social media history: Omar Mateen lived in St. Lucie County, Florida, with his second wife, Noor Zahi Salman, but it is not clear if they were together or separated at the time of the shooting.  Mateen sold his sister, Mariam Seddique, the house in April  16 for $10 (Quit Claim Deed). The Telegraph stated that,  Salman lived in a suburb of Chicago before moving to Fort Pierce with Mateen in November 2012. In December 2015 she is believed to have left Florida and moved in with relatives in Rodeo, California. She has not spoken publicly and has scrubbed her social media accounts since the attack. Early indications suggest the Orlando shooter s back story could shape up like the San Bernardino shooting, involving multiple arrests, with international backgrounds that could shine a light on other clandestine activities linking both terror and security.San Bernardino, along with staged-managed events like the sensational Garland Shooting in April 2015, and the highly engineered Paris Attacks (January & November of 2015) and many other shootings in year s past   have conveniently opened the door for sweeping  national security  changes, while at the same time reigniting the old War on Terror meme, rebranded as the  War on Radical Islam , for new audiences to be politically seduced by from western media and politicians alike.  IDENTITY CRISIS    Mateen frequented gay night clubs according to those who knew him. (Image Source: abcnews)The UK s Telegraph reported the following: The man who murdered 49 people at a gay club in Orlando was a closet homosexual who used gay dating apps and frequented gay bars, according to friends and locals in the city.On Tuesday police were considering pressing charges against Omar Mateen s second wife, Nour Salman, 30, who told the FBI she went with him to scope out possible targets, and that she had tried to stop him from carrying out the attack. Wouldn t this drastically alter the main narrative of the alleged shooter s hate crime motive?Big Questions RemainAll too often we see the  persona of any alleged killer being touted as hard evidence, despite the fact that even strong circumstantial evidence of any apparent crime would likely result in many hours of analysis, debate and procedural, potentially without a definitive conclusion, even if the evidence eventually reached a court room setting.Here s a recent report at 21WIRE, discussing Mateen s father s government ties and the rapidly failing Orlando shooting narrative: For the media, and every other political leader in the US, this was now classified as a  hate crime , and so  case closed. In other words, a simple story line with real traction was now baked firmly into this event   about a homophobic,  ISIS-inspired,  crazed  lone gunman  who  went postal  in a Orlando gay nightclub, and coincidentally, on the eve of an international Gay Pride celebration day. Just 24 hours later, we learn from a report in the Orlando Sentinel that the alleged shooter Omar Mateen was in fact a frequent visitor for years at the Pulse gay nightclub in Orlando. It was definitely him. He d come in for years, and people knew him,  one customer said. Another Pulse customer, Kevin West, even stated on record that he had been talking with Mateen for up to one year on a gay-chat mobile app. So, based on this updated information, this could not have been a  hate crime  because Omar Mateen was most likely gay himself, albeit in the closet.Likewise, this change in the story would also nullify much of the identity politics rhetoric currently being spun around this incident   like this statement released by Hillary Clinton within hours of the main event :REDUX: Media Spoils the Crime SceneIncredibly, we re told on Wednesday that, once again, the media has ransacked another alleged shooter s home on live TV (also recall the Virginia live TV shooting). Just like the scripted aftermath of San Bernardino this past December, any chance to recover any new forensic information is now lost, as the media taints another crime scene in a large-scale terror related investigation.During the San Bernardino media ransacking exercise, a scrum of reporters tore through the alleged shooters  apartment. In Orlando, the affair was paired down to only one media crew at a time. Here is MSNBC-UNIVSION reporter pretending to  discover  the ID of the shooter and family:MEDIA ALLOWED INSIDE  TERRORIST  HOUSEAttempts to dilute this obvious media operation were aired by networks like CBS, who ran the headline:  Possible Burglary at Orlando Shooter s Home : The Orlando shooting attack appears like many other phantom shooting events, with a hybrid of real implications and unreal aspects, uncanny twists and turns   linking Hollywood and security services, the FBI, near a backdrop of resorts, golf professionals, retirees and of course, Disneyland.Surreal   is an understatement.Here s 21WIRE s Patrick Henningsen with Brian Gerrish and Alex Thompson discussing the nature of these security linked and terror events on the UK Column END OF PART ONEStay tuned for more Orlando shooting updates READ MORE ORLANDO SHOOTING NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Orlando FilesHelp support us by becoming a 21WIRE Member at: 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"June 16, 2016"

23326,Father of Orlando Shooter is Long-time CIA Asset,"SEE ALSO: ORLANDO  KNOWN WOLF  Watched by FBI, Worked with DHS, Amid Crisis Actors, Drills & CI s21st Century Wire says The Orlando Shooting. Many things are just not right with this story, including the father of the alleged shooter Omar Mateen, an Afghan-American, Seddique Mateen, who is closely linked to some of the most powerful leaders and agencies in Washington DC.Below is a photo of Omar s father after a meeting at the US State Dept. in Washington DC where he met with  officials , but oddly, no log of his visit is available in the public record. Image Credit: facebook.com/seddique.mateenThe alleged shooter s father played an absolute key role in setting up the entire  hate crime  narrative by inserting this quote into the MSM machine during the immediate aftermath of the sensationalized media event. Seddique Mateen said: We were in Downtown Miami, Bayside, people were playing music, and he saw two men kissing each other in front of his wife and kid and he got very angry. They were kissing each other and touching each other and he said,  Look at that. In front of my son they are doing that.  And they we were in the men s bathroom and men were kissing each other. For the media, and every other political leader in the US, this was now classified as a  hate crime , and so  case closed. In other words, a simple story line with real traction was now baked firmly into this event   about a homophobic,  ISIS-inspired,  crazed  lone gunman  who  went postal  in a Orlando gay nightclub, and coincidentally, on the eve of an international Gay Pride celebration day.Pictured below is Seddique Mateen with California Republican Congressman Dana Rohrabacher. Rohrabacher (R-CA) was initially elected to Congress in 1988, with the fundraising help of friend Oliver North.Rohrabacher s decades-long involvement in  all things Afghan  eventually earned him the nickname  Gunga Dana.  Today he chairs the United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats.This morning President Obama called him a  home-grown  terrorist.  In a series of phone interviews Monday morning, Donald Trump responded that  there s something going on  with the President s  reaction to the Orlando shooting.I guess even a stopped clock is right twice a day. It s like calling Blackwater XE Orlando shooter Omar Mateen s father said  his son was not motivated by Islamist radical ideology, but in a Facebook video posted early Monday he said,  God himself will punish those involved in homosexuality. My own suspicion was first awakened on Monday morning when U.S. news outlets uniformly reported that the father s TV show aired on a   U.S.-based Afghan satellite channel.  That sort of circumlocution is typical when something is being hidden which the corporate media prefers we not ask questions about.The name of the nameless Afghan satellite channel, Payam Afghan, is said to be widely-known in Southwest Asia as a CIA-Pakistani ISI construct, as this picture from Flicker shows.The identification of shooter Omar Mateen also involved deception. He was said to work for a security company called G4S, which few have ever heard of. However,  G4S  is merely a re-branded  Wackenhut Corporation,  a name with a storied reputation for scandal in the U.S. and around the world.Rohrabacher has stated that he sees radical Islam as the source of a major terrorist threat to the U.S.Calls to his office today to request comment on whether he views CIA assets relocated in the U.S. as a terrorist threat have not been returned.SEE FULL REPORT: ORLANDO  KNOWN WOLF  Watched by FBI, Worked with DHS, Amid Crisis Actors, Drills & CI sHelp support us by becoming a 21WIRE Member at: 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"June 15, 2016"

23329,Who’s Better: “Dangerous Donald” or “Crooked Hillary”?,"21st Century Wire says Now that the Democratic Party establishment has finally put all its cards on the table and declared Hillary Clinton their  presumptive  nominee for President, the public at large is finally coming to grips with the prospect of a Trump vs Clinton election race come November. Rather than asking who is best fit to hold the highest office in the land, most pundits are instead asking the other question now: who is worse?To be absolutely fair, both of these personalities have their annoying and often infuriating attributes.There is one marked difference between these two political animals. While Trump is an unknown quantity in terms of politics and public service, Madame Secretary has a track record already, but not a great one.As the old adage goes   no matter who you vote for, the government always gets in  Thus far, we can say this much about Donald: he is consistent in that he will consistently make brash, off-the-cuff, shallow, offensive and often completely insane remarks on the campaign trail   remarks that should kill his opinion polls and finish his presidential run once and for all. Somehow though, he survives, and even thrives in the controversy. Most experts are still  speechless  for comment.As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton fronted at least one major war of aggression with the decapitation of the nation state of Libya in 2011. Since the US-led take-down of that country, things have gone from very bad to beyond the pale. Few will remember though, that Hillary Clinton was also fronting the US-UK-led  Friends of Syria  (2011-2012) Middle East & European regime change road show   where western leaders colluded with Gulf Kings and oil magnates to discuss the take-down and destruction of Syria.Regarding Israel, Clinton s record is completely pro-Israel with no caveats. She does not call for end to occupation of Palestine by Israel, nor will she publicly recognize the native Palestinians  collective right of self-determination, or their refugees right of return. She is also anti-Iran and will happily give succour to any and every Israeli desire on that issue.On the other hand, Donald Trump has made numerous public declarations including one on national TV about his intention to broker a peace deal between the Israelis and the native Palestinians.Does this mean Hillary will be worse than Donald? Not necessarily, because Washington has a way of grinding every political operator down to the same reprehensible level it seems.What it does mean is that with Hillary you know what you are getting, while with Donald, you don t.For those leaning towards Clinton in this Hobsons Choice simulation, this means the next default position is: better the devil you know.Once again, Americans seem forced into that tired old electoral clich , forced to choose between  the lesser of two evils (leave your thoughts and comments below)Marc Joffe Fiscal TimesIn 1991, Louisiana voters faced a difficult choice. In the runoff gubernatorial election that fall, the candidates were Democrat Edwin Edwards and Republican David Duke. The notoriously corrupt Edwards had already served three terms as governor and faced bribery charges. (When it turned out, after Edwards was acquitted in that case, that some of the sequestered jurors had stolen towels from their hotel, Edwards reportedly quipped that he had been judged by a  jury of my peers. ) Edwards would later be convicted on 17 counts of racketeering, extortion, money laundering and fraud.Duke s story was even worse; he was a former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and was still active in white supremacist circles. Mainstream Republicans lined up behind Edwards. In the heat of the campaign, which Edwards went on to win, it became common to see bumper stickers that read,  Vote for the Crook. It s Important. Maybe somebody should print up another batch of those stickers for the presidential race this year. With Hillary Clinton assured of surpassing the 2383 delegate nomination threshold today, Democrats have chosen an apparently corrupt candidate to be their presumptive nominee. She s still the better choice for president.Related: How Conservatives Stopped Listening and Lost Control of the GOPCircumstantial evidence of Clinton s corruption is abundant and easily found by anyone not in denial. Although she is not responsible for her husband s infidelity nor for Vince Foster s suicide, other scandals are not so easily dismissed. As the recent State Department Investigator General s report suggests, Clinton set up a home-brew email server in contravention of department policies to prevent disclosure of her correspondence. The IG report also confirms that, even today, Clinton has not turned over all the messages that passed through her personal server.Some of the missing messages may have documented the inappropriate links between her job as secretary of state and her involvement with the Clinton Foundation. As documented by Peter Schweizer in Clinton Cash, State Department project approvals sometimes coincided with large contributions to the foundation by beneficiaries of these actions. After leaving office, Clinton continued to sell her influence to the highest bidder, as evidenced by the $225,000 speaking fees she received from Goldman Sachs.Clinton s pay-for-play activity has a long history   going back at least to the late 1970s. As I previously wrote, Clinton effectively received a $98,000 bribe from interests related to Tyson Foods via a sham futures trading account. Her husband s Arkansas gubernatorial administration then eased oversight of Tyson, allowing it to contaminate one town s water supply with chicken manure.Related: Most Americans Don t Believe Hillary Clinton and Donald TrumpIn 1992, the cozy relationship between Bill Clinton s Arkansas state house, Hillary s Rose Law Firm and regulated entities was detailed by The Washington Post and raised by former California Gov. Jerry Brown during a presidential debate. Under Bill Clinton s administration, Arkansas issued multiple no-bid contracts to the Rose Law Firm, assigned it up $175,000 in bond counsel work and authorized Madison Guaranty Bank   a failing Savings and Loan Association represented by Hillary   to issue preferred stock.When political leaders fail to play by the rules applied to normal people, a natural reaction is to try and stop them. But, in this case, stopping Hillary Clinton means supporting someone else for president. And for those who think voting for a third party candidate is a waste, that leaves only one alternative:  Donald Trump.So rather than immediately dismissing Hillary for her ethical flaws, the correct approach is to determine whether she is better than the alternative. I tend to think the answer is yes.A useful way to look at the decision this November is to ask whether continuity or change is the better option for the U.S. at this point in time. Clinton is likely to continue most Obama-era policies, whereas Trump can be expected to attempt some radical departures.Related: Can Trump s Nationalist Trade Policy Really Make America Great Again?Complaints about the status quo notwithstanding, life in 2016 America isn t horrible for most of us, and so radical change comes with a lot of downside risk. Although some of the doom and gloom predictions about a Trump administration are overstated (for example, I would not expect white supremacists to play a major role in his administration), there are legitimate causes for concern.A major threat posed by Trump is the potential for a breakdown in global cooperation. Trump seems to view foreign countries like competing companies or candidates, failing to appreciate the interdependence that characterizes our global order. Trumpian brinkmanship could trigger a global trade war, repeating the error of the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff. When Herbert Hoover signed that piece of protectionist legislation, the result was a cascade of beggar thy neighbor reactions from U.S. trading partners, greatly exacerbating the Great Depression.Trump s policies toward illegal immigrants would also be destabilizing. Millions of undocumented aliens take service and agricultural jobs that American citizens avoid. If these individuals are rounded up or  self deport  in large numbers, industries that rely on them could be crippled. Alternatively, as last week s violence in San Jose portends, a Trump presidency is likely to produce more civil disorder Continue this story at Fiscal TimesREAD ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"June 10, 2016"
23330,"Who’s The Fascist? Barack Obama, Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton?","Margaret Kimberly Global ResearchThe U.S. public loves fascists; they elect them, constantly. Donald Trump, who  says he would raise the minimum wage and stop the endless efforts at regime change,  is called a fascist by some.  But Hillary Clinton  is happy to bomb Libya or Syria or any other country,  and played a major role in mass Black incarceration. Barack Obama is the war-maker and deporter-in-chief.  All of the major party candidates fit the F word description in some way. Donald Trump is the ill spoken, boorish, graceless version of every American president in modern history. He differs from them only in his unconcealed appeals to white nationalism. But Democrats aren t much better. They pretend to work on behalf of human, civil and economic rights but those claims are lies. They are meant to hide their partnerships with corporate America, very wealthy individuals and the worldwide imperialist project.If Trump is a fascist then he will fit in nicely with the pantheon of horrific men we are told to respect and venerate. Barack Obama charges and convicts whistle blowers with the little used espionage act from the era of Woodrow Wilson. He claims and has exercised an invented right to kill Americans. His predecessor invaded and occupied Iraq but he continues the dirty deed there and in Afghanistan. He tries to fool the public by assassinating  al Qaeda number two,  over and over again. Al Qaeda certainly doesn t lack for plan B staffers.Bush the younger cut tax rates for rich people but Obama didn t change that. Under the guise of compromising with intransigent Republicans he did the same thing. When he and the Democrats controlled Congress in 2009 and 2010 they raised the minimum wage a paltry 70 cents.Conversely, Donald Trump says he would raise the minimum wage and says he would stop the endless efforts at regime change. Neither Hillary Clinton nor Bernie Sanders have questioned that fundamental premise of American foreign policy. Hillary Clinton has already proven herself to be particularly blood thirsty. She is happy to bomb Libya or Syria or any other country. Her so-called expertise amounts to nothing more than an expansion of state sponsored terror committed by the United States.Trump says he wouldn t cut Social Security while Barack Obama famously declared that he and his 2012 Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, agreed on the need to cut this program that was once called the  third rail  of politics.Every president since the 1980s has grown the horrific mass incarceration industry. Using wars on drugs as a pretext they have locked up 2 million people, half of whom are black. No one comes into office with any intention of undoing America s leadership as the world s worst jailer.American history teaches black people to be, at the very least, wary of public officials who are beloved by red necks as much as Trump is. When Trump speaks of preventing Muslim immigration or deporting all of the estimated 11 million undocumented people in this country he is making inherently racist appeals.That is why he is protested and rightly so. But the protesters have already missed the mark by giving a pass to equally questionable policy actions and statements coming from Democrats.It is a Democratic president who brought back a cold war against Russia and recklessly brought troops to the edge of that country s borders.This scenario was unheard of during the worst days of the cold war and now risks nuclear confrontation. That is because George W. Bush unilaterally abrogated the missile defense treaty with Russia. Perhaps he can be called a fascist also.The trade deals passed by American presidents with congressional connivance grow worse. There is no longer any pretense that their goal is to help corporations maximize profits and minimize everyone else s rights. Not even members of Congress were allowed access to the text of the Trans Pacific Partnership legislation.If Trump is protested, Obama ought to be as well. He is spending his last year in office on an imperialism tour. He goes to Hiroshima for photo opportunities with atomic bomb survivors while building more nuclear warheads than any other president. He tells endless lies about Russian  aggression  but he is the provocative head of state.Trump should be disliked by Latinos and everyone else when he says that Mexican immigrants are rapists and murderers. But Obama is the deporter in chief, sending a record number of Latino immigrants out of the country with dubious rationales, devastating them and their families.Apparently all of the major party candidates fit the F word description in some way. Trump s bombast and ignorance make him the easiest to pick out of the crowd but appearances are deceiving. It seems that if a politician has the right establishment credentials and knows how to give prepared speeches he or she can get away with committing any outrage.In just the last 40 years American presidents or their allied partners in crime have killed people in Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Congo, Somalia, Haiti, Grenada, Gaza, Kosovo, Serbia, Sudan, Syria, Libya and Yemen. What do they have to do to be called fascists? Showing bad manners seems to be the only thing that sets off expressions of outrage among Americans.There is already fascism in the White House, the Justice Department, the State Department and Congress. The only question is who will be the next person to keep that sick machinery running.This article originally appeared on Global ResearchGet 10% off a 21WIRE TV membership package today using promo code: STU21WIRETVEVERYTHING ON ELECTION 2016: 21st Century Wire Election Files",Middle-east,"June 9, 2016"
23331,Expect more ‘terror busts’ as FBI steps up its use of “ISIS stings”,"21st Century Wire says If there is no real terrorist threat, then the thing to do is to create one. Such is the received wisdom of today s Federal Bureau of Investigation.According to its latest public relations release by the FBI s  counter terrorism  department, the agency plans to  significantly increased  its use of stings in order to catch would-be terrorists. In other words, it s planning to ramp-up its policy of using entrapment in order to organize, recruit, train and even supply materials to budding neophyte terrorists in the US.This should come as no surprise  to anyone who has been following these incidents. In spite the grand announcement, in reality   all the FBI has been doing for the last 25 years are just that: stings, stings and more stings  FBI Direct: James Comey has spend a lot of time in front of Congress this year. The logic is astounding, if not insane, but for some reason, this type of antiquated thinking still dominated US federal law enforcement institutions: We re not going to wait for the person to mobilize on his own time line,  said Michael B. Steinbach, who leads the F.B.I. s national security branch. He added that the F.B.I. could not afford to  just sit and wait knowing the individual is actively plotting. Since before 9/11, FBI agents have relied on the practice of using informants to pose as jihadi  radicals  or small arms dealers, in order to excite and recruit fringe members of society into constructive pursuits such as bomb-making, and will often bring them to the scene of a mock terrorists crime before agents leap out from behind the shadows to make a high-profile  arrest  of the unwitting dupe/suspect.In 2016, most of the recruitment required to assemble these theatrical, state-managed scenarios is done online via  friends  on social media, as FBI cyber agents look for individuals who appear to be supporting ISIS or Al-Qaeda. If successful, online grooming transitions to real world meeting, and with any luck   blossoms into a contrived  terror plot  courtesy of the FBI confidential informant. 1993 WTC BOMBER: Ramzi Yousef.Perhaps the best-ever example of a FBI sting resulting in a real terrorist attack is an event which the mindless US mainstream media still wrongly attribute to real terrorists   the 1993 World Trade Center Bombing.In this all-FBI-hatched plot, the agency used at least one known informant, a man named Emad Salem, a former Egyptian army officer. Salem later demonstrated on secret recording he made how the FBI originally asked him to supply the  conspirators  with harmless powder instead of actual explosive to construct their bomb, but for reasons still (officially) unknown, the FBI chose to allow a real bomb to be deployed at the WTC on the day of the supposed  sting .Author Tom Secker at Global Research explains it in the simplest terms:  this relatively ragtag group who were inspired by CIA asset the Blind Sheikh and trained by triple agent Ali Mohamed managed to pull off the bombing. The result was a bomb detonating underneath the WTC and putting thousands of innocent Americans at risk.Still, ever single major US television and newspaper outlet still moronically refers to the 1993 WTC event as a  terrorist attack on American soil.  Team America: Fabricated TerrorAccording to the FBI s own records, nearly 70% of (reported)  ISIS-linked  terrorist prosecutions (not convictions) are being cooked-up via the use of informants and stings/entrapment: Undercover operations, once seen as a last resort, are now used in about two of every three prosecutions involving people suspected of supporting the Islamic State, a sharp rise in the span of just two years, according to a New York Times analysis. Charges have been brought against nearly 90 Americans believed to be linked to the group. Back in May, the FBI arrested a man, James Medina, for allegedly for  planning an attack  on a Miami-area Aventura Turnberry Jewish Center synagogue with an explosive device. As it turns out, the synagogue was never actually in any real danger   as the bomb was a fake   sold to him by an FBI undercover agent, before the man was stopped before the man  was stopped by FBI agents posing as fellow terrorists who set up a sting operation. FBI chat-up lines:  Are you a Muslim? Which Mosque do you go to? Do you know al-Qaeda? In 2015, one classic exhibit was the frame-up of 20 year old Christopher Lee Cornell, snared in one of the most bogus fake terror plot ever, and yet the US mainstream media couldn t stop gushing over the event as if it were an  ISIS-inspired attack , only no attack actually took place.According to David Steele, a 20-year Marine Corps intelligence officer and former-CIA case officer, most US  terror  plots are cooked by by US authorities: Most terrorists are false flag terrorists, or are created by our own security services. In the United States, every single terrorist incident we have had has been a false flag, or has been an informant pushed on by the FBI. In fact, we now have citizens taking out restraining orders against FBI informants that are trying to incite terrorism. We ve become a lunatic asylum. Some other similar  would-be  high-profile terror icons and patsies include:  Paris Shooter Amedi Coulibaby (see his incredible informant case here),  Ottawa Shooter  Zehaf-Bibeau (see his patsy story here),  Boston Bomber  Tamerlan Tsarnaev (see his informant story here),  The Underwear Bomber  Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab (see his patsy story here), Buford Rogers (read his informant story here), Jerad Miller (read his informant story here), Naji Mansour (read his entrapment story here), Quazi Mohammad Nafis (read his patsy story here), Mohamed Osman Mohamud (read his entrapment story here), and even the infamous  OKC Bomber  Timothy McVeigh (read his sheep-dipped, patsy story here).In reality, it is the covert culture of Washington DC which does more to promote genuine terrorism, at home and internationally   much more than any other single nation state outside of Saudi Arabia and Israel.

23332,‘Journalistic Malpractice’: CNN Slammed for ‘Biased’ Coverage in Favour of Hillary,"21st Century Wire says This definitely needed to be said.Host of popular internet news shows The Young Turks, Cenk Uygur, has slammed the mainstream media for  journalistic malpractice  after they fraudulently announced that Hillary Clinton would be the Democratic nominee prior to the result of the California primary.Here at 21WIRE, we informed our readers last week that such big politik dirty tricks would be played.Uygur appeared on CNN saying: Brian, you guys, and I mean all of the establishment press, totally tilted the playing field here from day one by counting those superdelegates, Superdelegates do switch their votes all the time, they switched it in 2008. Hillary Clinton had a 100-superdelegate lead which completely vanished in 2008, But if you count them in the official tally, when you know they can, and often do switch their votes, and have not voted yet, that is simply incorrect, that s not journalism. From day one, which was absolutely incorrect, it was in fact journalistic malpractice which indicates an establishment bias.

23333,TV Host Buys and Forgives $15m Worth of U.S. Medical Debt,"21st Century Wire says This latest stunt only goes to show what a complete rip-off the US healthcare industry truly is.This week, John Oliver, host of HBO s Last Week Tonight trumped media mogul and billionaire Oprah Winfrey by announcing he will forgive the medical debt of 9,000 people. Presently, the US healthcare industry has the world s highest and most inflated medical pricing on goods and services   pushing millions of Americans into debt over health treatments which should not cost the same as a brand new Lexus SUV or Land Rover. Despite the hype, Obamacare did nothing to address this fundamental flaw in the US system. In fact, it made the situation worse, and has turned out to be absolute boon for the corporate insurance racket.If Obamacare was really all it was cracked up to be, then it would ve done en mass what John Oliver demonstrated on his show   buying up medical debt at a merger one half cent on the dollar, and then putting that into cold storage. Instead, Obamacare only succeeded in RAISING the cost (and debt) of healthcare for individual payers.More on this story here  Watch out, Oprah Winfrey. John Oliver, host of HBO s Last Week Tonight, outdid TV s biggest gift giver on Sunday when he forgave nearly $15m worth of medical debt on his show.Oliver s  giveaway  came at the end of a 20-minute segment on debt collectors. The segment focused on the bad actors in the industry, who buy debt from banks for cents on the dollar. These predatory collectors attempt to recoup the debt they purchased using threats and other aggressive tactics without first verifying the exact details of the debt. Once the company has bought your debt, whether the information is accurate or not, they are going to try to collect on it,  Oliver explained on Sunday.Last Week Tonight spent about $50 to create a debt-acquisition company in Mississippi. The corporation s name is Central Asset Recovery Professionals Inc   also known as Carp. According to Oliver, soon after its creation, Carp was offered a portfolio of medical debt worth $14,922,261.76 at a cost of  less than half a cent on a dollar, which is less than $60,000 .( )  Thanks to this 5 June airing of the HBO comedy series, Last Week Tonight show with John Oliver, there are a lot more of us now privy to this collection industry practice and the debt treadmill it creates,  said Craig Antico, co-founder of RIP Medical Debt.  In a painfully hilarious (debt as funny? Somehow, yes) piece, John Oliver triumphantly out-Oprah s Oprah in giving away valuable gifts.

23334,"American Scientists Harvesting Human Organs in Live Pigs, Creating a Human-Pig Embryo","21st Century Wire says This is one step closer to the future industry of farming organs in human surrogates.American scientists are now trying to grow human organs inside of pigs in order to  tackle the donor shortage  (problem, reaction, solution).The potential for limitless profits here is immense  The GuardianScientists trying to grow human organs inside pigs in an attempt to tackle a shortage of donors have successfully created part-human, part-pig embryos, it has been reported.Researchers at the University of California, Davis combined human stem cells and pig DNA and allowed the embryos to mature for 28 days, before terminating the experiment and analysing the tissue.They believe that the animals, which would have a human internal organ, may look and behave like any other pig and could be a ready source of organs for life-saving transplants.It was reported earlier this year that scientists had begun attempts to create the embryos but there has been opposition from authorities. In September last year, the US National Institutes of Health said it would not back research into so-called chimeras until it knew more about the implications.It cited fears that the presence of human cells could affect the animal s brain and behaviour, potentially making it more human. Prof Pablo Ross, the reproductive biologist leading the research, sought to calm those fears, saying that there was a  very low potential for a human brain to grow .Peter Stevenson, from Compassion in World Farming, told the BBC s Panorama programme:  I m nervous about opening up a new source of animal suffering. Let s first get many more people to donate organs. If there is still a shortage after that, we can consider using pigs, but on the basis that we eat less meat so that there is no overall increase in the number of pigs being used for human purposes. But Prof Ross said:  Our hope is that this pig embryo will develop normally but the pancreas will be made almost exclusively out of human cells and could be compatible with a patient for transplantation.

23335,HEAD GAMES: Technology With The Potential To Shape Reality,"Randy Johnson 21st Century Wire  MIRROR MIRROR   Am I still just a movie concept?  Virtual  avatar  technology is in its infancy   as far as we know (Image: Actor Sam Worthington from the science fiction blockbuster film, Avatar).Is humanity s recent quantum leap with technology all fun and games, or a zombie-like march into the arms of a technocratic prison world?For generations we have seen global figures such as John F. Kennedy or Ronald Reagan speak on television and that s what we believed we have seen and heard.We have all heard, people say things such as  The President said it   it was on the news  or  she said it on TV, I saw it.  Ever since the invention of the medium of television, this has served as a sufficient casual reference to any event away from the local area.What if the words and image of a global figure, broadcast to millions on television, was not real?  What if your eyes and ears where literally deceiving you?Simply put, what if seeing isn t believing anymore?  What if the person on screen, on LIVE television, who is actually interacting with questions asked, was not the person being represented on screen?With technological advancements, as exemplified with the  still-in-development Face2Face system, the potential to present and act any person to an audience for multiple reasons, both good and bad, is here.  With respect to black budgets, exotic technology, and unknown classified advancements of similar computer systems and programs   technology beyond that of the Face2Face system could already be here and further advanced.What exactly is a Face2Face system?  TechCrunch.com describes it as taking,  A YouTube video of someone speaking like, say, George W. Bush.  Use a standard RGB [Red Green Blue] webcam to capture a video of someone else emoting and saying something entirely different.  Throw both videos into the Face2Face system and  you ve now got a relatively believable video of George W. Bush s face   now almost entirely synthesized   doing whatever the actor in the second video wanted the target s face to do. If the definition eludes you, then take a look at the Face2Face system in action.Watch below as life-like avatars of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Vladimir Putin follow visual commands in real time via the Face2Face system. That s great.  What about the voice you might ask?It does not take a wild imagination to envision voice software programs linked up with visual avatars for something like the Face2Face system in real time.Celebrity  voice changer  technology or other  voice morphing  software is already available at the consumer level.  Many security systems, phones, and buildings grant access by authenticating a person s voice.  There is even a real danger for people to have their actual voice  hacked  as they leave samples of it everywhere throughout the day.If the Face2Face technology, in a development stage as seen above, as does voice changing and voice recognition technology exists, then it only follows that the audio and the visual technology are destined to sync up.Just think of the implications.You could potentially have John Wayne, Elvis, Michael Jordan, Osama bin Laden, Miley Cyrus, or Justin Beiber wishing you happy birthday on a video message and interacting with you   Live.  It isn t really them, but then again it is them, just in a virtual reality sort of way.  Could there eventually be monetary charges to use the likeness of famous people dead or alive with certain companies owning certain celebrity s long dead and families of recent celebrities getting a cut?Perhaps a world leader could be dead for weeks and still delivering speeches or issuing orders. Anyone can be misquoted intentionally and questioned, framed, or made to fall from grace in the court of public opinion.  If you could take over another nation s airwaves, their leader can be seen saying something they said on television   except for the fact it isn t them and they never said it. Wars have been started for less.In the summer of 2015, 21WIRE discussed the use of a 3D avatar in the political realm, as India s Prime Minister Narendra Mohdi delivered a holographic speech at some 900 different rallies over the course of his campaign: Some would argue politicians are actors or entertainers in their own right, but hologram use is not limited to entertainers. Narendra Mohdi has already used the technology during his successful campaign to become India s Prime Minister. What would the future of electioneering look like with this new high-tech gadgetry?It has long been known that US political strategists have shaped elections throughout the world.In 2015, Hollywood released a fictionalized political comedy-drama named after a documentary called Our Brand Is Crisis (2005), a picture which gave a behind-the-scenes account of how James Carville and the political consultancy Greenberg Carville Shrum (GCS) socially-engineered the 2002 Bolivian elections to help Gonzalo S nchez de Lozada win the heavily contested presidency. He eventually resigned due to the so-called  Gas Wars,  where it was announced that he would follow pro-US economic policies and export natural gas to the US and Mexico.The documentary displays much of the socially-engineered electioneering that has been ongoing by the West for decades   it makes you wonder what future Western-backed campaigns might look like when aided by new tech, such as Spain s recent holographic protests, that featured thousands marching in avatar form.  SOCK PUPPET PROTEST?    New forms of political control on the horizon. (Image Source: americansuburbx)Media platforms are used to manipulate.  The very images we see all sorts of screens and media platforms can be planned, created, and manipulated through the use of actors, sets, and computer graphics.So technology doesn t have an effect on the masses and is rolled out to society  without a blueprint  so to speak?  Just consider the now common scene below.  NOMOPHOBIA    Technology, consumerism, and human behavior together.  So close, yet so far away   (Image Source: mymimtimsum.blogspot.com)Mass media in particular, is often utilized to shape opinions, drive agendas, and to communicate messages to the masses.  This is nothing new and can be as mundane as with advertising and marketing.  Specialized fields such as consumer psychologists and behavioral scientists became part of marketing teams and campaigns.  Corporations within the United States, China, United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan spent over 590 billion dollars on advertising in 2015.  In so many words, shaping masses in various aspects of behavior is literally seen as a science.Is mainstream  news reporting  above the fray and simply covering events?  Is shaping minds and creating trends limited to marketing and mass commercialism?  Probably not.  It is now becoming common knowledge that 6 umbrella corporations own about 90% of the media.  If you steer the minds, shape the laws, and build the consensus, you control the profits and get to select winners and losers.  The saying  The medium is the message seems as relevant as ever.Virtual Reality vs Old Fashioned Reality LAWNMOWER MAN  (left image)   In this 1992 science fiction film, drugs & virtual reality augment human intelligence. (Image Source: movpins)Virtual reality or deception is best brought in  through the front door  and accepted slowly via entertainment means.  Movies, televisions, computers, the internet, and smart phones are the norm and were presented to the masses as a means of entertainment, news, communication or learning, but have a dark side of conditioning, monitoring people, propaganda dissemination and changing or controlling human outlooks on reality.For those old enough to remember life before the year 2000, they might remember having human interaction that included interaction in close proximity to others.  Now, so-called social networking is something not done in person.  It s almost fashionable for someone to ignore their surroundings and introvert themselves into the world  of a device.Nothing beats connecting with other people more than losing oneself into the cyber reality of a smart phone   DIGITAL SLAVE    This is becoming a familiar sight.  When the conversation is this good, why go out?  (Image Source: Prezi.com)Fun and games, or a zombie-like walk into the arms of a technocratic world. The Face2Face system technology above is not unlike the virtual reality (VR) technology used to map a person s face and expressions to a VR avatar. Mark Zukerberg s Facebook has shown heavy interest in the technology, most notably with its 2 billion dollar purchase of Silicon Valley VR firm Oculus Rift.The global acquisitions of talent and start-up companies with expertise in virtual reality technology by Facebook has been notable and they have stated their intent to integrate social networking with virtual reality and avatars.Nothing beats getting people together and networking than a visual representation of themselves in a virtual reality scenario.Get with it!  Reality is so yesterday!   OCULUS RIFT   purchased by Facebook, can map and copy face movements in real time. It has vast potential for shaping reality via gaming and social networking.Ready or not, an ever-increasing technological world is on the way. Virtual reality devices are not likely to become common overnight. However, over time, especially for those who can remember, it will probably be like when there were no smart phones. Eventually humankind could reach a point where few remember what it was like without it.In addition to Face2Face types of technology, holographic and projection technology, as seen with  Face Hacking , could be intertwined with Face-2-Face and voice morphing technologies.Read 21st Century Wire s article Face Hacking: 3-D Projection Mapping in Real Time here.The potential can be as amazing as it is disconcerting.

Ash Carter (above) alongside Peter Sellers as the enigmatic and satirical menace Dr. Strangelove.Is this the New American Mediocrity displaying its ignorance out of Washington DC, or is there more to it? Is Washington going into full cold war-esque Strangelove mode again ?RTBeijing has accused US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter of having a Cold War mentality, following his statement that China risks creating a  Great Wall of self-isolation  over its actions in the South China Sea.Speaking at a daily news briefing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Carter s remarks  laid bare the stereotypical US thinking and US hegemony. Indeed, there are some in the US who live physically in the 21st century, but whose minds are stuck in the Cold War era,  she said, as quoted by AP.China has no interest in any form of Cold War, nor are we interested in playing a role in a Hollywood movie written and directed by certain US military officials. However, China has no fear of and will counter any actions that threaten and undermine China s sovereignty and security,  Hua continued.The remarks come just days after US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said that China risks creating a  Great Wall of self-isolation  through its military expansion in the South China sea and its alleged hacks on US companies. China s actions could erect a Great Wall of self-isolation,  Carter told graduating officers at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, on Friday.  Countries across the region   allies, partners, and the unaligned   are voicing concerns publicly and privately at the highest levels.

This is going to be a long fight. It s a huge growth area for us. We might, perhaps, understand this as a legitimate phenomenon, if it was not for the fact that it was the US who created and supported the terrorist group, initially under the guise of  moderate rebels , throughout Syria.This is just more proof that the military industrial complex is the only winner to emerge from increased global conflict.How might foreign policy decisions be different if they were not influenced by the arms industry?THE RISE OF THE ARMS INDUSTRY: 21st Century Wire Military Industrial Complex Files",Middle-east,"May 24, 2016"

23352,U.S. struggles to convince Iraqis that Washington doesn’t support ISIS,"They took out Saddam in two weeks, but they can t finish IS in two years?  asked Falih, another Iraqi who asked that his last name not be used out of security concerns.  It just doesn t make sense. 21st Century Wire says This latest report serves as a reminder of just how thin the US-led international game of supporting extremist militants has become.The most comical part of this story is how US military court scribes at the Associated Press are still in denial that Iraqis are harboring ill will against the US for suffocating (via crippling sanctions), bombing and destroying, looting and occupying their country over the last 25 years.Aside from numerous reports showing US weapons and equipment being dropped  by accident  and then used by ISIS, it s undeniable by now that the US have been the primary driver in fueling the rise and growth of this militant fighting group over the last 7 years.Associated Press writers are very careful to frame this narrative and advance the establishment s favorite meme that the debacle of Iraq was down to US  government incompetence , rather than inherent malice   even though history clearly demonstrates that malice has been omnipresent in US foreign policy for at least the last 70 years.SEE ALSO: 50 Years of Targeted  Kill Lists  by US Government Why can t they (the Iraqis) appreciate what we ve done for them?  Seriously  Sinan Salaheddin and Susannah George AP/Military.comBAGHDAD   For nearly two years, U.S. airstrikes, military advisers and weapons shipments have helped Iraqi forces roll back the Islamic State group.The U.S.-led coalition has carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes against ISIS targets in Iraq at a total cost of $7 billion since August 2014, including operations in Syria. On Tuesday a U.S. Navy SEAL was the third serviceman to die fighting ISIS in Iraq.But many Iraqis still aren t convinced the Americans are on their side.Government-allied Shiite militiamen on the front-lines post videos of U.S. supplies purportedly seized from ISIS militants or found in areas liberated from the extremist group. Newspapers and TV networks repeat conspiracy theories that the U.S. created the jihadi group to sow chaos in the region in order to seize its oil.Skepticism about U.S. motives is deeply rooted in Iraq, where many still blame the chaos after the 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein on American malice rather than incompetence Read more at Military.comREAD MORE ISIS NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire ISIS Files",Middle-east,"May 11, 2016"
23353,EXPOSED: Facebook Blacklists Conservative News & Falsified ‘Black Lives Matter’ Trend,"21st Century Wire says Censorship is running rampant on the world s largest social media website.Watch a video of this report here:. Former Facebook workers have come out with shocking revelations that the social media giant is actively censoring conservative news topics and reports, while also falsifying its list of  trending  topics.The source says that workers routinely prevented stories about the right-wing CPAC gathering, Mitt Romney, Rand Paul, and other conservative topics from appearing in the highly-influential section, despite the fact that they were organically trending on the site.The workers were known as  news curators , and even actively  injected  news stories and reports into the trending list even when they were not organically popular enough to be included.Facebook claims that the site s news trends section  shows you topics that have recently become popular on Facebook , but these revelations mean that the section actually just reflects the personal biases of its owners and the institutional concerns of the corporation.The anonymous source said: Depending on who was on shift, things would be blacklisted or trending, I believe it had a chilling effect on conservative news, I d come on shift and I d discover that CPAC or Mitt Romney or Glenn Beck or popular conservative topics wouldn t be trending because either the curator didn t recognize the news topic or it was like they had a bias against Ted Cruz. The source kept an active log of the omissions, which included former IRS official Lois Lerner, who was accused by Republicans of inappropriately scrutinizing conservative groups; Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker; popular conservative news aggregator the Drudge Report; Chris Kyle, the former Navy SEAL who was murdered in 2013; and former Fox News contributor Steven Crowder.Yet, while omissions are worrying, the scariest aspect of this story is how Facebook actively injects falsified trends into the news feeds of its one billion users. The corporation can fraudulently set not only a national, but international, conversation on a topic of its choosing and also skew its bias toward which ever way its owners lean.The source continued: Facebook got a lot of pressure about not having a trending topic for Black Lives Matter. They realized it was a problem, and they boosted it in the ordering. They gave it preference over other topics. When we injected it, everyone started saying,  Yeah, now I m seeing it as number one . The Black Lives Matter movement is widely credited as having originated from social media, but this suggests that its true origins lie elsewhere in the hands of very small group of elite  news curators  seeking to implement their own personal agenda in American politics.Facebook s response to these damning revelations is most definitely lacking: We take allegations of bias very seriously. Facebook is a platform for people and perspectives from across the political spectrum. Trending Topics shows you the popular topics and hashtags that are being talked about on Facebook. There are rigorous guidelines in place for the review team to ensure consistency and neutrality. These guidelines do not permit the suppression of political perspectives. Nor do they permit the prioritization of one viewpoint over another or one news outlet over another. These guidelines do not prohibit any news outlet from appearing in Trending Topics.

23355,"Saudi Prince Lectures America On Democracy, Calling For ‘NEVER TRUMP’","21st Century Wire says Well, isn t this interesting. Saudi Arabian princes are giving lessons in democracy?Incredible. The headline reads:  Saudi Prince Begs America to Reject Trump. In summary: here we have a hereditary monarch, from a Wahabi theocratic dictatorship now lecturing Americans on who they should vote for in their elections.  During his recent dinner speech at the Washington Institute For Near East Policy at the Mandarin Oriental hotel, Prince Turki- al-Faisal (photo, below), a graduate of Georgetown University, made his passionate plea to the American electorate not to elect Donald J. Trump as president.NOTE: The word  election  is a treasonous concept in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and if you are ever caught asking for it   you will not only be jailed, but will likely face capital punishment. The Mail Online reported:A Saudi prince has urged Americans not to vote for Donald Trump in the upcoming general election. Turki al-Faisal, who served as Saudia Arabia s ambassador to the US from 2005 to 2007, spoke against the presumptive Republican nominee during a foreign policy dinner in Washington, DC on Thursday.He blasted Trump s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US, which the billionaire first formulated in December last year before renewing his vow on Wednesday. For the life of me, I cannot believe that a country like the United States can afford to have someone as president who simply says,  These people are not going to be allowed to come to the United States,  Turki said according to the Huffington Post.Prince Turki currently serves as the chairman of the Saudi Arabian-funded Washington DC-based think tank,  King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies.  Interestingly, the Saudi Prince was sharing his Washington DC event stage with none other than Israeli general Yaakov Amidror, the former national security advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Amidror presided over a number of violent operations against the native Palestinian population, including the slaughter of over 500 civilians in Gaza in 2012Whether or not one likes (or loathes) the presumptive Republican Party presidential nominee, it s important to consider the Prince s comments in perspective So who is a greater threat to peace and stability in the Middle East and Central Asia, and elsewhere   Donald Trump or the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia? Let s quickly examine some of Saudi Arabia s  progressive  and democratic credentials.Oil-based MonarchyThe current ruling family in Saudi Arabia, the House of Saud, was installed into power by the British in the early 20th century. Since the development of Saudi Arabia s oil fields, mainly by US and UK firms, tribal elites have had the luxury of having  money on tap , amounting to many trillions of dollars in continuous energy revenue, with almost all of the wealth channeled into the hands of hereditary and royal elites. Saudi s repression of democracy is not limited to its own borders, however. When a true  Arab Spring  event broke out in neighboring Bahrain in 2011, Saudi Arabia deployed its army to put down any popular uprising, and still patrols those streets today.More recently, their vast oil fortunes have been channeled into building-up a militarized state, and recently, with the backing of the US and PR cover by the UN, have openly waged war on its neighbor, Yemen.Regressive SocietyEven in the 21st century, Saudi Arabia still manages to win the near submissive support of the US and the UK, despite the fact that it is running an openly regressive, medieval theocratic autocracy, where hundreds of its citizens are executed in the street, many via beheading. Last year, in 2015, was a record year for beheadings under the newly crowned King Salman. PATRONAGE: President Obama paying tribute to the new King Salman of Saudi Arabia.No Religious FreedomThe Kingdom is also actively repressing its own native Shi ite population, as well as others who are not born into the right royaly-favored religion or tribe.  Practicing Christianity is also forbidden in the Kingdom and any attempted conversion from Islam is punishable by death.Genocidal Military StateFor the last 14 months, and with the assistance of the US, Saudi Arabia and its GCC allies have been waging an illegal and highly brutal military war of aggression against its neighbor Yemen   killing tens of thousands of Yemeni civilians and displacing millions more.World s Premier Supporter of Islamic Extremism and TerrorismHistorically, it is now accepted as fact that Saudi Arabia the world s leading financial supporter of Islamic extremist terrorism in the Middle East and beyond. This has been the case for many decades starting from the Kingdom s central role, together with the CIA and others, in supporting Mujadhedin militants and al Qaeda in Afghanistan from the late 1970 s and all the way through to their involvement in 9/11. This trend continues today, with Saudi, along with its tribal monarch cousin, Qatar, as the primary source of funding and support for terrorist fighting groups like Jabhat Al Nusra (al Qaeda in Syria) and also Islamic State (ISIS), as well as a direct financier of radical Mosques all over the world.Saudi Nuclear Weapon PlansIn the same interview this week, Prince Turki also dropped  another bomb , so to speak, by announcing Saudi Arabia s somewhat disturbing ambitions to acquire nuclear weapons:Saudi Arabia has accepted the Iran nuclear deal, which lasts 10-15 years, Prince Turki said. But what happens after that is  open to question. That s why I ve always maintained that we   must consider all options, including the acquisition of nuclear weapons,  the prince added   though he emphasized his preference for a nuclear weapons-free zone in the region.So who is the real threat in the region and beyond? One thing should be certain by now   it s not Iran, or Donald Trump.READ MORE SAUDI NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Saudi Arabia Files",Middle-east,"May 9, 2016"

Furthermore, that figure only accounts for broadcast television, not cable or satellite.About one out of every four dollars against Trump came from Conservative Solutions PAC, a group supporting Marco Rubio s candidacy.Two groups supporting Cruz wasted nearly $16 million in their effort, while his campaign spent $4.3 million.One group supporting Jeb Bush spent $10 million against Trump.Hillary Clinton s campaign has already spent $5.2 million specifically going after Trump.Yet, despite all of these huge sums of money being spent to try and disparage Trump s run for the presidency   they have all failed.Donald Trump is the only candidate still standing on the GOP ticket, and a new poll suggests Trump can indeed beat establishment-darling Hillary Clinton.Most shocking for the establishment, perhaps, is that Trump himself only spent $19 million on campaign advertising   around a quarter of what was spent against him.What is the system going to try next to further its campaign to stop Trump?GET THE FULL STORY ON THE 2016 ELECTION: 21st Century Wire Election Files",Middle-east,"May 6, 2016"

23362,"Cruz & Kasich Quit: Trump Crushes Elite Establishment, #DropOutHillary Now Trending","21st Century Wire says The field is now clear for Trump to become the GOP presidential nominee.Watch a video of this report here:Ted Cruz and John Kasich have both now bowed out of the presidential race, leaving Donald Trump as the last Republican candidate standing.The two failing candidates made their decision after Trump swept to victory in Indiana last night.Dr. Inderjeet Parmar, Head of the Department of International Politics at City University London, says that,  it has exposed a deeply divided Republican party whose leadership has lost all credibility and whose conservative philosophy, which it has held dear since 1980, is in tatters. It is, indeed, the elite leadership of both political parties that appears to have provoked this realignment in US politics towards outsiders and those not embroiled in what many see as a corrupt and broken system.Bernie Sanders, the Democratic outsider, also shocked the world with a victory over Hillary Clinton last night.Just two weeks ago Cruz and Kasich were publicising that they had made a deal to stop Trump, yet even their combined efforts were useless.Yesterday, a Rasmussen poll emerged showing that Donald Trump can indeed beat Hillary Clinton at the general election, and that scenario is looking ever more likely with the political establishment in such dramatic retreat.It is possible that Bernie voters will not support Hillary in the general election, and in many ways their anti-establishment position gels much better with the politics of Trump than it does with Wall Street insider Clinton.Immediately after Kasich s announcement today, #DropOutHillary began trending on Twitter. At the time of writing it is the number two trending hashtag in the US with 102,000 tweets.With such an immediate response taking aim at another establishment figure, the chances of Trump, or perhaps even Sanders, taking the presidency seem higher than ever.GET THE FULL STORY ON THE ELECTION: 21st Century Wire 2016 Election Files",Middle-east,"May 4, 2016"
23363,False Flag Florida: FBI Agents ‘Posing As Terrorists’ in Miami Sting Operation,"21st Century Wire says The FBI is walking a very fine line that crosses into the unacceptable.Watch a video of this report here:The FBI has apparently arrested a man planning an attack on a Miami-area synagogue with an explosive device.The suspect had allegedly planned to attack the Aventura Turnberry Jewish Center on Friday evening.The plot, which is about as simple as they come, involved throwing an explosive device over a wall and into the synagogue grounds during Friday night services, as congregants would have been marking the start of Shabbat and the final day of Passover.Most importantly, the synagogue was never actually in any real danger.This is because, the man  was stopped by FBI agents posing as fellow terrorists who set up a sting operation. The bomb, apparently a dummy, was  sold to him in Hallandale Beach by an FBI undercover operative just before the planned terror attack .What this means, is that the suspect James Medina, may have never had the material means to carry out any attack with an explosive device unless it had been provided by the FBI.So why is anybody praising the FBI for stopping a terror attack when they are the very group that facilitated its implementation in the first place?The synagogue s Facebook page issued a statement saying the FBI had even told them that,  there are no credible threats directed against us at the present time. No credible threats  means that the only threat was a fictitious false flag created by the FBI.Democratic Party National Committee head and Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, apparently unaware of the finer details, said she was,  deeply grateful that the FBI arrested this individual before he was allegedly able to do harm to the Aventura Turnberry Jewish Center .Where do we draw the line between  posing as a terrorist , and actually being a terrorist?How can the FBI be allowed to facilitate such incidents and then claim credit, both financially and politically, for stopping them?ALL THE FALSE FLAG INFO YOU NEED: 21st Century Wire False Flag Files",Middle-east,"May 3, 2016"
23364,Shock to The System: New Poll Says Trump CAN Beat Hillary,"21st Century Wire says This is the news that the elite political establishment did not want to hear.Watch a video of this report here:A new poll by Rasmussen Reports has Donald Trump beating Hillary Clinton by two points in a head-to-head matchup.Trump comes in at 41% with Clinton trailing behind with 39%.15% of respondents would prefer some other candidate, while 5% were undecided.Last week, Rasmussen ran the same poll and the candidates were evenly split with 38% each.Other polls have suggested that Trump has no chance of beating Hillary, but this latest development certainly brings those conclusions into question.The elite political establishment class is definitely going to be worried by this news, and the ridiculous attacks levelled against Trump may be about to reach new heights.Most worrying for those elites is the thought of America getting along with other countries, something that Trump has explicitly stated he wants to do as president.This means an end to foreign adventurism that has made the military industrial complex such a force to be reckoned with in modern America.Trump has even said that he wants to promote stability around the world and not change, implicitly suggesting that supporting foreign terrorist groups to overthrow nations is the wrong move.This new poll means that this drastic change to American foreign policy direction is one step closer to becoming reality, and with Trump himself promising to crush  Crooked Hillary Clinton  in the debates   this could be just the start of things to come.GET THE FULL STORY ON THE ELECTION: 21st Century Wire 2016 Election Files",Middle-east,"May 3, 2016"

(Photo link scoopnest)Earlier the week, US Senator John McCain s campaign fundraiser Emily Pitha was arrested at her Phoenix residence by Maricopa County sheriff s deputies after an operational meth lab was discovered on the premises by authorities.Pitha, an independent consultant at the political organization LovasCo Consulting Group has been involved in Arizona political fundraising for nearly 3 years according to her Linkedin profile.The LovasCo Consulting Group is operated by Corinne Lovas, wife of Arizona Representative Phil Lovas. McCain s re-election campaign parted ties with Pitha after her arrest but said it will continue to work with LovasCo.  FUNDRAISER TO FELON?   Emily Pitha, McCain s campaign fundraiser seen here in an image from LinkedIn. (Photo link phoenixnewtimes)Dirty MoneyPitha, 34, along with her boyfriend, Christopher Hustrulid, 36, face a host of felony drug charges after authorities were tipped off by package that arrived at her residence from the Netherlands containing 250 grams of MDMA.The Phoenix New Times recently reported that the couple s Phoenix home turned up a large quantity of contraband and evidence of drug dealing.  The New Times also stated in an ironic twist that The top Republican fundraising company that employed drug-bust suspect Emily Pitha also raised money for Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy, an anti-marijuana-legalization group. Prior to Pitha serving as a constituent service representative for former Senator Jon Kyl, Senator Jeff Flake, she recently worked as a logistics manager for former Ambassador Barbara Barrett in 2013, according to her LinkedIn profile.Barrett is chairman of the Aerospace Corporation and served as the US Ambassador to Finland from 2008-2009. Aerospace has direct ties to the Senate Armed Services Committee with some of its former board members serving as counsel for the CIA, Department of Defense and Department of State. US Senator John McCain curently serves as Chairman for the Senate Armed Services Committee.  BREAKING BAD   Emily Pitha with boyfriend Christopher Hustrulid arrested after being implicated in multiple drug related charges. (Photo link phoenixnewtimes)Political PlagueOver the past few years, 21WIRE has outlined a virtual wrap sheet of items that have led to McCain s fall from grace on the political scene. Most notably, in May of 2013, Senator McCain illegally entered into northern Syria to meet with known members of terrorist factions while claiming that they were  moderate rebels  not connected to extremist fighting groups.Following this trip, the false chemical weapons allegations implicating Syria s Assad soon appeared on the scene just months after McCain s planned visit.McCain later met with NeoNazi fascist leaders in Kiev, a few short months before Maidan Square melted down and the West s regime change took shape in the Ukraine.In the face of all this, McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee continues to be  hawkish  on Syria and calling for more than the 250 troops recently deployed to Syria.Will authorities account for all of the funds raised by Pitha and look at how they were appropriated?McCain s political career has been plagued by a series of blunders and scandals   one wonders if his campaign will be derailed by the charges against his former fundraiser or will this inconvenient truth get swept under the rug?Read more from Sputnik below   SCANDAL    US Senator John McCain (Photo link beforeitsnews.com)SputnikIs the beleaguered US Senator s reelection bid taking a page from the hit series Breaking Bad in a desperate attempt to appeal to young voters? On Tuesday, 34-year-old Emily Pitha was arrested for narcotics distribution and manufacturing when Maricopa County sheriff s deputies found an active meth lab and illicit drugs during a search of her north-central Phoenix home.Pitha, a former staffer for retired Arizona Republican US Senator Jon Kyl, was serving as the chief fundraiser for Arizona Republican Senator John McCain s 2016 reelection bid at the time of her arrest. The McCain campaign immediately released a statement saying Pitha was  immediately terminated upon our learning of her alleged involvement in narcotics distribution The sheriff s office spokesperson said that they were alerted to criminal activity at the residence after a package was identified in transit from the Netherlands carrying over 250 grams of MDMA, street name ecstasy, a popular and illegal psychoactive drug. Pitha s boyfriend, 36-year-old Christopher Hustrulid, signed for the package when it was delivered Tuesday afternoon, right before a search warrant was served.Detective Doug Matteson said that the two children, ages 5 and 10,  had easy access to all of (the) drugs and materials, even the bomb-making materials that were located in the back with the meth lab.  Methamphetamine production involves volatile elements also used in manufacturing explosives.The news comes as McCain finds himself in the most competitive reelection campaign of his career. In the Republican Primary, the embattled US Senator faces an insurgent challenge from Tea Party Republican state senator Kelli Ward who has successfully tapped into the anti-establishment narrative of the 2016 election cycle.Continue this story at Sputnik READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"April 28, 2016"

23368,"Trump’s Foreign Policy: Promote Stability NOT Change, Stop Helping Terrorists","21st Century Wire says We are sure that the military industrial complex is not at all happy about the prospect of using diplomacy before cruise missiles.In Donald Trump s foreign policy speech today he made numerous points that would lead us to believe that his stance on this area of policy will be radically different to what has become the norm.Aside from the usual campaign rhetoric of ensuring America has the strongest military on the planet, Trump made numerous points clearly stating that the military option will not be his first option.Trump specifically spoke of being very careful as to whom the US assists, particularly in the Middle East, and to only help those who are true allies, which is a clear stab at recent policies to arm and support terrorist groups to overthrow nations like Libya and Syria.He also explicitly stated that the US needs to  stop seeking radical change in the world , and instead look to promote stability through diplomacy saying: Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction. The presidential hopeful is also looking to drastically cool off the rising tensions with Russia. He called out so-called foreign policy experts for ruining the situation, and said: Easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia is absolutely possible. It would be easy to dismiss all of these statements as nothing but campaign rhetoric, but Trump appears to be positioning himself as the master dealmaker. He has nothing to gain from being a warmonger, as he is not tied to the military industrial complex interests like establishment candidates, so there is no real reason to doubt this anti-interventionist stance.Watch Donald Trump s full foreign policy speech here: ",Middle-east,"April 27, 2016"
23369,Grasping At Straws (The Illusion of Choice)," Art by Dan Lacey via Etsy (See his work here)Zen GardnerIt s pitiful to watch the US election gyrations in the midst of this calculated societal breakdown. Americans have historically had such guts and strength, while albeit pitiful little is left, as they direct their vestigial frustration in such futile directions in the throes of their certain demise.So many have attached their grievances and hence hopes for change to this new set of puppet false promises it s absolutely not just alarming, but seriously disturbing. The very nature of looking to others to change their circumstances, never mind via such obvious psychopathic, self-serving, self-appointed dupes and character actors, is just overwhelming.The fundamental full-frontal reality that they seem hypnotically destined to participate in such an obviously manipulated environment truly boggles the mind.The same can be said for the sleeping and compliant European population, but I don t think it s quite as vast as the American phenomenon we re witnessing   but it s getting closer. Either example, it s clearly a pathetic display of uninformed ignorance and subservient compliance on a massive, disheartening scale.When will people wake up to the obvious truth of what s transpiring around them and realize their innate power of personal manifestation and all it would entail?All 0f this is an ongoing and ever present challenge, but apparently part of the learning process we re undergoing here. It s No Easy TransitionGranted, such a complex interactive world seems to have no simple solution, but I contend it essentially does. When individuals wake up to their true power everything takes on new dimensions of reality. Not only does our active role become manifest, but the futility of reacting to the paradigm that s been laid out to be our assumed playing ground inherently reveals itself.And begins to lose its power and thus crumbles.Not an easy transition to make for the system-ingrained mindset. But it s happening. Why? Because the system itself is breaking down and showing its illusory nature, day by day, staged event by falsely reported announcement and propaganda piece. The so-called news is nothing but one shallow, misleading and disempowering non sequitur news story at a time.It s not an easy process to go through, waking up to the fact that we ve been literally bullshitted to death for so long. People understandably don t react well most of the time to this news. Some take it on and see the deep significance and sit back and learn to digest it and draw conscious conclusions. However, most try to bury this reality, or just get mad and even psychotic to some degree which leads to the mass hysteria we re witnessing today.In a way I can t blame them   yet I can. The voice of conscience is there for all. It appears continually. Whether we listen to and pursue its beckoning call is a choice, one heart signal at a time. It s not once and forever gone   it continually appears, giving opportunities right, left and center despite the misinformation and the dystopic psycho-chemical-electromagnetic and even nuclear storm we live in.The results are before our eyes of what people have currently chosen on the macro scale. Quite sad to behold in a mass spectrum knowing these are individuals making bad decisions, but then look at the shining examples of those who have taken up the torch for truth and consciousness!Therein lies the difference.Don t Circle the Drain with the Rest of ThemIt does no good, intrinsic or otherwise, to ride the mass wave of further willful ignorance and eventual destruction as if participating in some act of resonant compassion.As real as that subconscious impulse is it s crap, and full on programmed co-dependent fear-of-arising-as-an-authentic-self form of self disempowered thinking!Snap out of it. We are each majestic manifestations of Universe in co-creative action. This subject is way deep with extremely empowering and revelatory notions but one thing is certain. We are not who they say we are. We are not destined to be tooled about by others and forced to petition these entities for changes they have no intention of implementing  while giving us the illusion we can make any kind of difference in their paradigm.It s time for truly revolutionary change based on radically transcendent thinking and resultant realizations.And to have the guts to venture into the realms where we can manifest this true revolution for the sake of our planet and co-inhabitants.Are you up to it? Get there and be there.It s sure time.Take up the call.Love, ZenZenGardner.comFor more articles and interviews by Zen go to his Timeline.READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"April 22, 2016"
23370,Hillary Clinton: Neocon War-Hawk in Waiting," Robert Parry Consortium NewsIf there were any doubts that Hillary Clinton favours a neo-conservative foreign policy, her performance at Thursday s debate should have laid them to rest. In every meaningful sense, she is a neocon and   if she becomes President   Americans should expect more global tensions and conflicts in pursuit of the neocons  signature goal of  regime change  in countries that get in their way.Beyond sharing this neocon  regime change  obsession, former Secretary of State Clinton also talks like a neocon. One of their trademark skills is to use propaganda or  perception management  to demonize their targets and to romanticize their allies, what is called  glueing white hats  on their side and  glueing black hats  on the other.So, in defending her role in the Libyan  regime change,  Clinton called the slain Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi  genocidal  though that is a gross exaggeration of Gaddafi s efforts to beat back Islamic militants in 2011. But her approach fits with what the neocons do. They realize that almost no one will dare challenge such a characterization because to do so opens you to accusations of being a  Gaddafi apologist. Similarly, before the Iraq War, the neocons knew that they could level pretty much any charge against Saddam Hussein no matter how false or absurd, knowing that it would go uncontested in mainstream political and media circles. No one wanted to be a  Saddam apologist. Clinton, like the neocons, also shows selective humanitarian outrage. For instance, she laments the suffering of Israelis under crude (almost never lethal) rocket fire from Gaza but shows next to no sympathy for Palestinians being slaughtered by sophisticated (highly lethal) Israeli missiles and bombs.She talks about the need for  safe zones  or  no-fly zones  for Syrians opposed to another demonized enemy, Syria s President Bashar al-Assad, but not for the people of Gaza who face the wrath of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Yes, I do still support a no-fly zone [in Syria] because I think we need to put in safe havens for those poor Syrians who are fleeing both Assad and ISIS and have some place that they can be safe,  Clinton said. But she showed no such empathy for Palestinians defenseless against Israel s mowing the grass  operations against men, women and children trapped in Gaza.In Clinton s (and the neocons ) worldview, the Israelis are the aggrieved victims and the Palestinians the heartless aggressors. Referring to the Gaza rocket fire, she said: I can tell you right now I have been there with Israeli officials going back more than 25 years that they do not seek this kind of attacks. They do not invite the rockets raining down on their towns and villages. They do not believe that there should be a constant incitement by Hamas aided and abetted by Iran against Israel.  So, I don t know how you run a country when you are under constant threat, terrorist attack, rockets coming at you. You have a right to defend yourself.  Gaza one year after Israel s Operation Protective Edge 2014Ignoring HistoryClinton ignored the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which dates back to the 1940s when Israeli terrorist organizations engaged in massacres to drive Palestinians from their ancestral lands and murdered British officials who were responsible for governing the territory. Israeli encroachment on Palestinian lands has continued to the present day.But Clinton framed the conflict entirely along the propaganda lines of the Israeli government: Remember, Israel left Gaza. They took out all the Israelis. They turned the keys over to the Palestinian people. And what happened? Hamas took over Gaza. So instead of having a thriving economy with the kind of opportunities that the children of the Palestinians deserve, we have a terrorist haven that is getting more and more rockets shipped in from Iran and elsewhere. So, Clinton made clear   both at the debate and in her recent AIPAC speech   that she is fully in line with the neocon reverence for Israel and eager to take out any government or group that Israel puts on its enemies list. While waxing rhapsodic about the U.S.-Israeli relationship   promising to take it  to the next level Clinton vows to challenge Syria, Iran, Russia and other countries that have resisted or obstructed the neocon/Israeli  wish list  for  regime change. In response to Clinton s Israel-pandering, Sen. Bernie Sanders, who once worked on an Israeli kibbutz as a young man, did the unthinkable in American politics. He called out Clinton for her double standards on Israel-Palestine and suggested that Netanyahu may not be the greatest man on earth. You gave a major speech to AIPAC,  Sanders said,  and you barely mentioned the Palestinians.   All that I am saying is we cannot continue to be one-sided. There are two sides to the issue.   There comes a time when if we pursue justice and peace, we are going to have to say that Netanyahu is not right all of the time. But in Hillary Clinton s mind, the Israeli-Palestinian dispute is essentially one-sided. During her speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee last month, she depicted Israel as entirely an innocent victim in the Mideast conflicts. As we gather here, three evolving threats   Iran s continued aggression, a rising tide of extremism across a wide arc of instability, and the growing effort to de-legitimize Israel on the world stage   are converging to make the U.S.-Israel alliance more indispensable than ever,  she declared. The United States and Israel must be closer than ever, stronger than ever and more determined than ever to prevail against our common adversaries and to advance our shared values.   This is especially true at a time when Israel faces brutal terrorist stabbings, shootings and vehicle attacks at home. Parents worry about letting their children walk down the street. Families live in fear. Yet, Clinton made no reference to Palestinian parents who worry about their children walking down the street or playing on a beach and facing the possibility of sudden death from an Israeli drone or warplane. Instead, she scolded Palestinian adults.  Palestinian leaders need to stop inciting violence, stop celebrating terrorists as martyrs and stop paying rewards to their families,  she said.Then, Clinton promised to put her future administration at the service of the Israeli government. Clinton said: One of the first things I ll do in office is invite the Israeli prime minister to visit the White House. And I will send a delegation from the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs to Israel for early consultations. Let s also expand our collaboration beyond security. Pleasing PhrasesIn selling her neocon policies to the American public, Clinton puts the military aspects in pleasing phrases, like  safe zones  and  no-fly zones.  Yet, what she means by that is that as President she will invade Syria and push  regime change,  following much the same course that she used to persuade a reluctant President Obama to invade Libya in 2011.The Libyan operation was sold as a  humanitarian  mission to protect innocent civilians though Gaddafi was targeting Islamic militants much as he claimed at the time and was not engaging in any mass slaughter of civilians. Clinton also knew that the European allies, such as France, had less than noble motives in wanting to take out Gaddafi.As Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal explained to her, the French were concerned that Gaddafi was working to develop a pan-African currency which would have given Francophone African countries greater freedom from their former colonial master and would undermine French economic dominance of those ex-colonies.In an April 2, 2011 email, Blumenthal informed Clinton that sources close to one of Gaddafi sons reported that Gaddafi s government had accumulated 143 tons of gold and a similar amount of silver that  was intended to be used to establish a pan-African currency  that would be an alternative to the French franc.Blumenthal added that  this was one of the factors that influenced President Nicolas Sarkozy s decision to commit France to the attack on Libya.  Sarkozy also wanted a greater share of Libya s oil production and to increase French influence in North Africa, Blumenthal wrote. Sarkozy and Gadaffi before they fell out. Photo Telegraph.But few Americans would rally to a war fought to keep North Africa under France s thumb. So, the winning approach was to demonize Gaddafi with salacious rumors about him giving Viagra to his troops so they could rape more, a ludicrous allegation that was raised by then-U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, who also claimed that Gaddafi s snipers were intentionally shooting children.With Americans fed a steady diet of such crude propaganda, there was little serious debate about the wisdom of Clinton s Libyan  regime change.  Meanwhile, other emails show that Clinton s advisers were contemplating how to exploit Gaddafi s overthrow as the dramatic moment to declare a  Clinton Doctrine  built on using smart power. On Oct. 20, 2011, when U.S.-backed rebels captured Gaddafi, sodomized him with a knife and then murdered him, Secretary of State Clinton couldn t contain her glee. Paraphrasing a famous Julius Caesar quote, she declared about Gaddafi,  we came, we saw, he died. But this U.S.-organized  regime change  quickly turned sour as old tribal rivalries, which Gaddafi had contained, were unleashed. Plus, it turned out that Gaddafi s warnings that many of the rebels were Islamic militants turned out to be true. On Sept. 11, 2012, one extremist militia overran the U.S. consulate in Benghazi killing U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.Soon, Libya slid into anarchy and Western nations abandoned their embassies in Tripoli. President Obama now terms the Libyan fiasco the biggest mistake of his presidency. But Clinton refuses to be chastened by the debacle, much as she appeared to learn nothing from her support for the Iraq invasion in 2003.The Libyan MirageDuring Thursday s debate   instead of joining Obama in recognition of the Libyan failure   Clinton acted as if she had overseen some glowing success: Well, let me say I think we did a great deal to help the Libyan people after Gaddafi s demise.   We helped them hold two successful elections, something that is not easy, which they did very well because they had a pent-up desire to try to chart their own future after 42 years of dictatorship. I was very proud of that.  We also worked to help them set up their government. We sent a lot of American experts there. We offered to help them secure their borders, to train a new military. They, at the end, when it came to security issues,   did not want troops from any other country, not just us, European or other countries, in Libya. And so we were caught in a very difficult position. They could not provide security on their own, which we could see and we told them that, but they didn t want to have others helping to provide that security. And the result has been a clash between different parts of the country, terrorists taking up some locations in the country. But that is exactly the point. Like the earlier neocon-driven  regime change  in Iraq, the  regime change  obsession blinds the neocons from recognizing that not only are these operations violations of basic international law regarding sovereignty of other nations but the invasions unleash powerful internal rivalries that neocons, who know little about the inner workings of these countries, soon find they can t control.Yet, America s neocons are so arrogant and so influential that they simply move from one catastrophe to the next like a swarm of locust spreading chaos and death around the globe. They also adapt readily to changes in the political climate.That s why some savvy neocons, such as the Brookings Institution s Robert Kagan, have endorsed Clinton, who The New York Times reported has become  The vessel into which many interventionists are pouring their hopes. Kagan told the Times: I feel comfortable with her on foreign policy. If she pursues a policy which we think she will pursue it s something that might have been called neocon, but clearly her supporters are not going to call it that; they are going to call it something else. Now with Clinton s election seemingly within reach, the neocons are even more excited about how they can get back to work achieving Syrian  regime change,  overturning Obama s nuclear deal with Iran, and   what is becoming their ultimate goal   destabilizing nuclear-armed Russia and seeking  regime change  in Moscow.After all, by helping Assad bring some stability to Syria and assisting Obama in securing the Iranian nuclear deal, Russian President Vladimir Putin has become what the neocons view as the linchpin of resistance to their  regime change  goals. Pull Putin down, the thinking goes, and the neocons can resume checking off their to-do list of Israel s adversaries: Syria, Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas, etc.And what could possibly go wrong by destabilizing nuclear-armed Russia and forcing some disruptive  regime change ?By making Russia s economy scream and instigating a Maidan-style revolt in Moscow s Red Square, the neocons see their geopolitical path being cleared, but what they don t take into account is that the likely successor to Putin would not be some malleable drunk like the late Russian President Boris Yeltsin but, far more likely, a hardline nationalist who might be a lot more careless with the nuclear codes than Putin.But, hey, when has a neocon  regime change  scheme veered off into a dangerous and unanticipated direction?A Neocon True-BelieverIn Thursday s debate, Hillary Clinton showed how much she has become a neocon true-believer. Despite the catastrophic  regime changes  in Iraq and Libya, she vowed to invade Syria, although she dresses up that reality in pretty phrases like  safe zones  and  no-fly zones. She also revived the idea of increasing the flow of weapons to  moderate  rebels although they, in reality, mostly fight under the command umbrella of Al Qaeda s Nusra Front.Clinton also suggested that the Syria mess can be blamed on President Obama s rejection of her recommendations in 2011 to authorize a more direct U.S. military intervention.  Nobody stood up to Assad and removed him,  Clinton said,  and we have had a far greater disaster in Syria than we are currently dealing with right now in Libya. In other words, Clinton still harbors the  regime change  goal in Syria. But the problem always was that the anti-Assad forces were penetrated by Al Qaeda and what is now called the Islamic State. The more likely result from Clinton s goal of removing Assad would be the collapse of the Syrian security forces and a victory for Al Qaeda s Nusra Front and/or the Islamic State.If that were to happen, the horrific situation in Syria would become cataclysmic. Millions of Syrians, Alawites, Shiites, Christians, secularists and other  infidels , would have to flee the beheading swords of these terror groups. That might well force a full-scale U.S. and European invasion of Syria with the bloody outcome probably similar to the disastrous Iraq War.The only reasonable hope for Syria is for the Assad regime and the less radical Sunni oppositionists to work out some power-sharing agreement, stabilize most of the country, neutralize to some degree the jihadists, and then hold elections, letting the Syrian people decide whether  Assad must go!    not the U.S. government. But that s not what Clinton wants.Perhaps even more dangerous, Clinton s bellicose rhetoric suggests that she would eagerly move into a dangerous Cold War confrontation with Russia under the upside-down propaganda theme blaming tensions in Eastern Europe on  Russian aggression,  not NATO s expansion up to Russia s borders and the U.S.-backed coup in Ukraine in 2014 which ousted an elected president and touched off a civil war.That coup, which followed neocon fury at Putin for his helping Obama avert U.S. bombing campaigns against Syria and Iran, was largely orchestrated by neocons associated with the U.S. government, including Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland (Robert Kagan s wife), Sen. John McCain and National Endowment for Democracy President Carl Gershman. Nuland and the famous cookies.After the violent coup, when the people of Crimea voted by 96 percent to secede from Ukraine and rejoin Russia, the U.S. government and Western media deemed that a  Russian invasion  and when ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine rose up in resistance to the new authorities in Kiev that became  Russian aggression. NATO on the MoveThough President Obama should know better   and I m told that he does know better   he has succumbed this time to pressure to go along with what he calls the Washington  playbook  of saber-rattling and militarism. NATO is moving more and more combat troops up to the Russian border while Washington has organized punishing economic sanctions aimed at disrupting the Russian economy.Hillary Clinton appears fully onboard with the neocon goal of grabbing the Big Enchilada,  regime change  in Moscow. Rather than seeing the world as it is, she continues to look through the wrong end of the telescope in line with all the anti-Russian propaganda and the demonization of Putin, whom Clinton has compared to Hitler.Supporting NATO s military buildup on Russia s border, Clinton said: With Russia being more aggressive, making all kinds of intimidating moves toward the Baltic countries, we ve seen what they ve done in eastern Ukraine, we know how they want to rewrite the map of Europe, it is not in our interests [to reduce U.S. support for NATO]. Think of how much it would cost if Russia s aggression were not deterred because NATO was there on the front lines making it clear they could not move forward. Though Clinton s anti-Russian delusions are shared by many powerful people in Official Washington, they are no more accurate than the other claims about Iraq s WMD, Gaddafi passing out Viagra to his troops, the humanitarian need to invade Syria, the craziness about Iran being the principal source of terrorism (when it is the Saudis, the Qataris, the Turks and other Sunni powers that have bred Al Qaeda and the Islamic State), and the notion that the Palestinians are the ones picking on the Israelis, not the other way around.However, Clinton s buying into the neocon propaganda about Russia may be the most dangerous   arguably existential   threat that a Clinton presidency would present to the world. Yes, she may launch U.S. military strikes against the Syrian government (which could open the gates of Damascus to Al Qaeda and the Islamic State); yes, she might push Iran into renouncing the nuclear agreement (and putting the Israeli/neocon goal to bomb-bomb-bomb-Iran back on the table); yes, she might make Obama s progressive critics long for his more temperate presidency.But Clinton s potential escalation of the new Cold War with Russia could be both the most costly and conceivably the most suicidal feature of a Clinton-45 presidency.Unlike her times as Secretary of State, when Obama could block her militaristic schemes, there will be no one to stop her if she is elected President, surrounded by like-minded neocon advisers.***Investigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

23371,Exposed: The US is an Oligarchy Ruled by Billionaires and Dictators," Eric Zuesse Off GuardianEven for the post of U.S. President, the preferences of the American people have only a marginal, if any, impact upon the selection of the person to occupy that post.In Colorado s Republican race to win delegates to the Republican National Convention for selecting the Republican Presidential nominee, there was no primary, and there was no caucus.As the Republican magazine National Review headlined on April 11th, attempting to justify what a Republican wag had just headlined as  Cruz Celebrates Voterless Win : Donald Trump Laid a Colorado Goose Egg because He Was Disorganized and Amateurish. Their argument (since they campaign for any Republican but Trump) was: he lost  because he was disorganized and amateurish  not because he had been cheated by the Party-hierarchy.National Review explained that in the process which had been set up by the Colorado Republican Party (it s set up by each individual state s Republican Party, not by the National Republican Party),  delegates to the national convention would be selected at congressional-district conventions and the Republican s [sic] state convention , and this was done in order to give Colorado s delegates more flexibility,  not done in order to require delegates to reflect the Republican (or any other) electorate in Colorado (since NR doesn t like even its own Party s electorate).This was the explanation that was provided by that magazine, which backs Cruz, and which has been campaigning ferociously against Trump.  Their article was built upon, and extensively quoted, the justifications put forth by one particular Cruz delegate, who said, The grassroots made the decision that Ted Cruz was the best candidate for us, and the grassroots made the decision to come out for Cruz and absolutely swept the table. He called it  our caucus system.  Whatever it was, it shut out all rank-and-file Republican voters, and left everything to people like himself, who could afford to do this: You have to put in the work, you have to put in the effort, and you have to do it months ahead of time. In other words: only Republican Party activists in Colorado could participate in selecting the delegates who would participate in selecting the Republican nominee. No one else was allowed to.  Their conception of the Colorado Republican Party is that it s only the Party s activists; and, if you re not a Republican activist, you have no say.It s as if to say:Only people who work in the government can have a say in how the government is to be run.  It s for insiders only and, of course, indirectly it s for whomever pays those insiders and so enables them to  put in the work  to participate.National Public Radio had a different take on this matter.  Steve Inskeep headlined there GOP Delegate: Trump Primary Wins  Absolutely Irrelevant  At Convention.  He interviewed Curly Haughland, a member of the Republican National Committee who lives in North Dakota, and who said: No matter what the popular belief might be,   there is no connection between primaries and the actual convention. Well, that s putting it rather bluntly. Haughland also said: Cited the GOP s convention Rules 37 and 38. He interprets these convoluted rules to mean that delegates may  vote their conscience.  The rules do not explicitly say this. Rule 37 is a detailed explanation of the procedure for roll-call votes. However, Rule 38 does say that no delegate may be  bound  by the  unit rule, meaning that delegates from a state can t all be forced to vote the same way. Another of Haughland s points is indisputable: When the convention convenes,  he said,  the delegates adopt their own rules, which haven t been adopted yet.  There is a standard template for conventions, but delegates could tweak the template, changing the game in any way that they want. In other words: the National Republican Committee says that all of the delegates to the Republican National Convention are allowed to  tweak the template, changing the game in any way that they want. So: the delegates at that Convention won t actually be representing anyone but themselves there. They are entirely free to push for anyone whom they personally want to win the Republican U.S. Presidential nomination.They re not bound, not even on the first ballot. They might pretend to be, if they feel a need to put on a show that looks  democratic , but any who don t feel the need to make such a pretense, can do whatever they want on the first ballot, just like on any successive ballot. They are free; all of them are free. It s only the electorate who aren t   they re not represented, at all.What about on the Democratic side?  Wyoming had held its Democratic Party caucuses on April 9, and there really were caucuses.  Two days later, CNN headlined Wyoming Democratic Caucuses: Bernie Sanders Picks Up Another Win , and reported: Bernie Sanders won the Wyoming Democratic caucuses Saturday, providing his campaign with one more jolt of momentum before the race against Hillary Clinton heads east. Even so, he made no gains in Clinton s delegate lead, as each earned seven delegates as a result.    On April 12th a youtube video was posted, MSNBC Morning Host Admits The  Whole Voting System Is Rigged  After Bernie Get s Cheated! Here the co-hosts had a conversation about the results:  Sanders beat Hillary Clinton by twelve points, 56 to 44,   He wins by twelve points.  The accompanying image showed the delegate-count, in this contest that Sanders had won by 56% to 44%:  18 total.  Hillary Clinton 11, Bernie Sanders 7.  It wasn t 7 to 7, after all.Though Sanders had outscored Clinton by 12%, it was worse than even-steven for him; he had actually lost by 11 delegates to 7 delegates.  This system is so rigged!  said one host.  There s absolutely no reason any of those people voted,  said the other.A Hillary Clinton supporter was the  expert  on the panel, and he said,  It s not rigged. These are the rules.  He wasn t given time to explain that fine point   or how  the rules  were necessarily  not rigged. Also on April 12th, Public Radio International s Todd Zwillich headlined (falsely), Six Reasons Bernie Sanders Won Wyoming, But Still Tied in the Delegate Race , and Zwillig failed to explain that word  Tied.  He opened:  How, many of you ask, could Bernie have won Wyoming 56 percent to Hillary s 44 percent, but still split the delegates with her 50-50?  Then, he repeated that there had supposedly been  The 7-7 split,  but he also said  Wyoming has a total of 18 delegates  (which obviously isn tthe sum of 7+7) and he was also likewise incoherent, all the way through.Maybe  the rules  in the Wyoming Democratic Party are like that; but, whatever they are, is so convoluted, America s news-media couldn t explain what they were, much less were they able to argue persuasively that this was somehow a democracy.The only thing that s clear is that the electoral system in the United States is so convoluted, so complex and so different from state to state and party to party, that whatever the intent of the writers of America s Constitution might have been, the system as it is today, can be successfully gamed and won only by interests who can afford to spend whatever billions of dollars are necessary in order to win. It s certainly anything but democratic.Right now, according to RealClear Politics, there are only two Presidential candidates who are shown repeatedly, and almost consistently, to be preferred by the majority of the U.S. electorate: the Democrat Bernie Sanders is strongly preferred over the Republicans Trump and Cruz, and he is barely preferred over the Republican Kasich; and the Republican Kasich is strongly preferred over the Democrat Clinton.  (Clinton loses strongly to Kasich and barely beats Cruz, while Trump is the weakest general-election candidate of all.)The strongest general-election candidates are, clearly, Sanders in the Democratic Party, and Kasich in the Republican Party. In a democracy, those would be the candidates. Throughout the contest thus far, neither of these two has been favored likely to win his respective Party s nomination, much less the Presidency.Whatever America is, it isn t a democracy   a one-person-one-vote majority-rule republic. In fact, the only scientific study that has ever been done of the U.S. political system, finds that it s no  democracy  at all, but instead an  oligarchy, a nation ruled by its aristocracy, its billionaires.It represents them, not the citizenry. That might not be the theory, but empirically it is the fact. An oligarchy is the commonest type of dictatorship, and it certainly is never a  benevolent dictatorship,  even if that phrase is not an oxymoron in itself.To sum up: the U.S. is ruled by and for the corrupters.

23372,Kerry’s Lunacy: ‘US Would Be Justified Shooting Down Unarmed Russian Jets’,"21st Century Wire says As 21WIRE reported yesterday, imperial bureaucrats in Washington and their court scribes in the mainstream media propaganda industry   continue the charade of the Roman mindset, believing that the US has eminent domain over the entire planet and all must kneel in the presence of old glory.It s statements like this that indicate how with each passing day, NATO is fast becoming a defunct organization.As he hopelessly clings to his outdated Cold War script, Bonesman and US Secretary of State John Kerry continues to be completely detached from reality  Jason Ditz Antiwar.comUS officials are still on about yesterday s incident, in which a pair of unarmed Russian jets flew within 30 feet of a US destroyer in the Baltic Sea, something US officials described as a  simulated attack  that proved Russia s  unprofessional  nature.Today, Secretary of State John Kerry declared the flights  provocative  and insisted the USS Donald Cook would ve been well within its rights to shoot down the planes under the  rules of engagement  they are placed under.Which is a stunning claim, since the USS Donald Cook is deployed in the peaceful Baltic, off the coast of the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, and the US and Russia are not at war. That they have rules of engagement allowing them to unilaterally attack Russian aircraft at all seems unwise.Russian Major General Igor Konashenkov says he is  baffled  by the US reaction, saying the Russian jets were operating well within their safety guidelines, and that the US freedom of navigation near a Russian naval base  does not at all cancel the principle of freedom of flight for Russian aircraft.

23374,CRIMINAL: Details Emerge of Washington’s ‘Fast & Furious’ Arms Trafficking in Syria,"21st Century Wire says No doubt about it. In comparison to Washington s other weapons trafficking exploits, like Operation Fast & Furious, this one is even more reckless, dangerous, totally unethical   and completely illegal. Back in 2011, President Obama green-lighted one of the CIA s worst ever operations   one which resulted in a five year-long flood of weapons, ammunition   right into the hands of  moderate  terrorist fighters running wild in Syria.In total, hundreds of millions in US taxpayer funds have been spent on arming terrorists in Syria. This is no accident. Obama assured Arab monarchs that the US would supply the weapons for the proxy war in Syria.The twisted logic and naive optimism of Washington elites was such that they were convinced that these terrorists would eventually bring Syria to its knees and topple the government in Damascus   enabling the US-led  coalition  to divide up Syria and rules over a protracted period of chaos in the region, not caring about the  collateral damage  they have caused along the way.Somehow, we are meant be believe that the current US President really cares about gun control, and yet here he is   running point one of the largest illegal weapons-tracking operations in history, and not a crocodile tear is shed for any of the hundreds of thousands of innocent Syrian lives that have been lost because of this criminal US policy.This is proof that the US has been actively undermining the ceasefire in Syria, but it s only the tip of iceberg  IHS Janes 360Documents released by the US government s Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website have provided an indication of the types and numbers of Eastern European weapons and ammunition the United States is providing to Syrian rebel groups as part of a programme that continues despite the widely respected ceasefire in that country.[The following manifest was make available through official channels]The FBO has released two solicitations in recent months looking for shipping companies to transport explosive material from Eastern Europe to the Jordanian port of Aqaba on behalf of the US Navy s Military Sealift Command.Released on 3 November 2015, the first solicitation sought a contractor to ship 81 containers of cargo that included explosive material from Constanta in Bulgaria to Aqaba.The solicitation was subsequently updated with a detailed packing list that showed the cargo had a total weight of 994 tonnes, a little under half of which was to be unloaded at Agalar, a military pier near the Turkish town of Tasucu, the other half at Aqaba.The cargo listed in the document included AK-47 rifles, PKM general-purpose machine guns, DShK heavy machine guns, RPG-7 rocket launchers, and 9K111M Faktoria anti-tank guided weapon (ATGW) systems. The Faktoria is an improved version of the 9K111 Fagot ATGW, the primary difference being that its missile has a tandem warhead for defeating explosive reactive armour (ERA) fitted to some tanks.READ MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Syria Files",Middle-east,"April 13, 2016"

The intelligence agency has long been keeping an eye on the Western entertainment industry and has even had a role in producing popular fiction movies and documentaries.In his article for Fair.org media watchdog investigative journalist Adam Johnson argues that this type of collaboration may cast a shadow over the image of US media workers and even put them at risk. For years, artists from across the entertainment industry  actors, authors, directors, producers, screenwriters, and others  have been in touch with the CIA to gain a better understanding of our intelligence mission,  the CIA public website reads.According to the website, the CIA s goal in engaging with the industry is to ensure  an accurate portrayal of the men and women of the CIA, and the skill, innovation, daring, and commitment to public service that defines them.

23376,"FBI Director James Comey: ‘Trust, but protect’ (and cover your laptop webcam with tape)","21st Century Wire says NSA and police state cheerleaders will often use the flimsy defense of mass surveillance, claiming that it s  legal , and therefore, it is somehow right, and that we must  trust  the state because the U.S. is an  advance  democracy, land of the free, home of the brave (you know the drill).The truth of the matter is independent of the whims of the state (in this case, the Orwellian police state), which is this: when laws are manipulated and passed through our bicameral legislative machine and then used for oppressive and profitable ends   the very ends that so many great writers and philosophers warned us about for centuries   then those laws, along with the state s omnipotent authority  must be challenged.

23377,Would a Hillary Clinton Presidency Mean More Wars?,"Special Report: Savvy neocons see Hillary Clinton as their Trojan Horse to be pulled into the White House by Democratic voters, raising the question: would a Clinton-45 presidency mean more wars, asks Robert Parry  Robert Parry Consortium NewsThe Democratic Party establishment seems determined to drag Hillary Clinton s listless campaign across the finish line of her race with Bernie Sanders and then count on Republican divisions to give her a path to the White House. But   if she gets there   the world should hold its breath.If Clinton becomes President, she will be surrounded by a neocon-dominated American foreign policy establishment that will press her to resume its  regime change  strategies in the Middle East and escalate its new and dangerous Cold War against Russia.If Bashar al-Assad is still president of Syria, there will be demands that she finally go for the knock-out blow; there will be pressure, too, for her to ratchet up sanctions on Iran pushing Tehran toward renouncing the nuclear agreement; there are already calls for deploying more U.S. troops on Russia s border and integrating Ukraine into the NATO military structure.President Clinton-45 would hear the clever talking points justifying these moves, the swaggering tough-guy/gal rhetoric, and the tear-jerking propaganda about evil enemies throwing babies off incubators, giving Viagra to soldiers to rape more women, and committing horrific crimes (some real but many imagined) against defenseless innocents.Does anyone think that Hillary Clinton has the wisdom to resist these siren songs of confrontation and war, even if she were inclined to?President Barack Obama, who   for all his faults   has a much deeper and subtler intellect than Hillary Clinton, found himself so battered by these pressures from the militaristic Washington  playbook  that he whined about his predicament to The Atlantic s Jeffrey Goldberg, himself a neocon war hawk.The Washington foreign policy establishment is now so profoundly in the hands of the neocons and their  liberal interventionist  sidekicks that the sitting President presumably couldn t find anyone but a neocon to give those interviews to, even as he complained about how the U.S. capital is in the hands of warmongers.Given this neocon domination of U.S. foreign policy  especially in the State Department bureaucracy, the major media and the big think tanks   Clinton will be buffeted by hawkish demands and plans both from outside of her administration and from within. ARCHTECTS OF WAR: Neocon war hawk and Israeli advocate Robert Kagan and his wife Victoria Nuland are hoping for a Clinton win n November.Already key neocons, such as the Brookings Institution s Robert Kagan, are signaling that they expect to have substantial influence over Clinton s foreign policy. Kagan, who has repackaged himself as a  liberal interventionist, threw his support to Clinton, who put him on a State Department advisory board.There is also talk in Washington that Kagan s neocon wife, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland, another Clinton favorite and the architect of the  regime change  in Ukraine, would be in line for a top foreign policy job in a Clinton-45 administration.Neocons Back in ChargeSo, Clinton s election could mean that some of the most dangerous people in American foreign policy would be whispering their schemes for war and more war directly into her ear   and her record shows that she is very susceptible to such guidance.At every turn, as a U.S. senator and as Secretary of State, Clinton has opted for  regime change  solutions   from the Iraq invasion in 2003 to the Honduras coup in 2009 to the Libyan air war in 2011 to the Syria civil war since 2011   or she has advocated for the escalation of conflicts, such as in Afghanistan and with Iran, rather than engaging in reasonable give-and-take negotiations.Though her backers tout her experience as Secretary of State, the reality was that she repeatedly disdained genuine diplomacy and was constantly hectoring President Obama into adopting the most violent and confrontational options.He sometimes did (the Afghan  surge,  the Libyan war, the Iran nuclear stand-off) but he sometimes didn t (reversing the Afghan escalation, finally negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran after Clinton left, rejecting a direct U.S. military assault on the Syrian government, and working at times with the Russians on Iran and Syria).In other words, Obama acted as a register or brake restraining Clinton s hawkishness. With Clinton as the President, however, she would have no such restraints. One could expect her to endorse many if not all the harebrained neocon schemes, much as President George W. Bush did when his neocon advisers exploited his fear and fury over 9/11 to guide him into their  regime change  agenda for the Middle East. After Bush s Iraq invasion in 2003, Washington s neocons were joking about whether Iran or Syria should come next, with the punch line:  Real men go to Tehran!  But the Iraq War wasn t the  cakewalk  that the neocons had predicted. Instead of throwing flowers at the U.S. troops, Iraqis planted IEDs Continue this story at Consortium NewsInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

Still, as the leader of the US and with the US as NATO s leading player, President Obama is completely responsible for over 30,000 deaths, as well as a failed state in Libya which has since descended into war-lording chaos and ISIS maniacs now running amok   almost guaranteeing a redeployment of western forces in the region.

23380,First Time in 30 Years: US Deploys B-52 Bombers to Qatar to bomb… ISIS?,"21st Century Wire says Is Washington preparing to carpet bomb Raqqa? If so, what will be the  trigger  for this boldly adroit military maneuver to deploy B-52 Bombers to the Middle East?Back in Dec 2015, GOP contender Ted Cruz vowed he would  carpet bomb ISIS  if elected president (and to hell with any collateral damage). He recently repeated that call on FOX network s Kelly File show. If I am elected president, we will defeat radical Islamic terrorism, and we will utterly destroy ISIS,  he said.  And yes that means carpet bombing them into oblivion.  But it s not Cruz ramping up the Pentagon s military footprint   it s Barack Obama who is the international aggressor, but he s  leading from behind  safely in the background in order to preserve his party s fast-diminishing dovish allure in a delicate election year.Regardless, the U.S. are desperate to save face in the Middle East after 5 years of failed policy and arming terrorists in Syria and northern Iraq while acting as if they were forming a Coalition to defeat the terrorists   a totally fraudulent narrative (yes, you read that correctly, and the evidence is now in).Is this a sign of thing to come..?In a conventional conflict, the B-52 can perform air interdiction, offensive counter-air and maritime operations. During Desert Storm, B-52s delivered 40 percent of all the weapons dropped by coalition forces. It is highly effective when used for ocean surveillance, and can assist the U.S. Navy in anti-ship and mine-laying operations. Two B-52s, in two hours, can monitor 140,000 square miles (364,000 square kilometers) of ocean surface. All B-52s are equipped with an electro-optical viewing system that uses platinum silicide forward-looking infrared and high resolution low-light-level television sensors to augment the targeting, battle assessment, flight safety and terrain-avoidance system, thus further improving its combat ability and low-level flight capability. (U.S. Air Force photo) RTAmerican B-52 Stratofortress bombers have been sent for their first Middle East operational deployment since the 1991 Gulf War 26 years ago. The aircraft are flying from Qatar to bomb Islamic State targets.An undisclosed number of B-52s have arrived at the Al Udeid Air Base on Sunday, the US Air Force said. The B-52 will provide the coalition continued precision and deliver desired airpower effects, Lt. Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., commander, US Air Forces Central Command said in the statement.The B-52 is a long-range multi-purpose heavy bomber. The Central Command last used them during Operation Desert Storm against Saddam Hussein s Iraq, when the aircraft flew sorties from Saudi Arabia.The deployment is meant to replace a contingent of B-1 Lancer swing-wing bombers which departed the Middle East in January for maintenance and a series of upgrades, the US Army s Stars and Stripes reported. The B-52 demonstrates our continued resolve to apply persistent pressure on Daesh and defend the region in any future contingency,  Brown said, referring to Islamic State by its Arabic-language acronym.The deployment comes shortly after Russia used its long-range Tupolev Tu-22, Tu-95 and Tu-160 bombers to strike terrorist targets in Syria. The Russian aircraft flew from their home bases over the Caspian Sea, Iran and Iraq to reach the Syrian territory.READ MORE PENTAGON NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Pentagon Files",Middle-east,"April 10, 2016"
23381,Hillary Clinton: “Victory Fund” Gets Massive Cash Injection from Hedge Fund Management (Soros),"Wall Street on ParadeAt the Democratic debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa on November 14, 2015, Hillary Clinton attempted to portray herself as the fierce enemy of hedge funds. She told the audience the following: You have two billionaire hedge fund managers who started a Super PAC and they re advertising against me in Iowa as we speak. So they clearly think I m going to do what I say I will do . But two hedge fund billionaires backing a Republican candidate pales in comparison to the tens of millions of dollars flooding into Hillary Clinton s campaign from other hedge fund billionaires   including money flowing into a joint fundraising committee called the  Hillary Victory Fund  that is sluicing money to both Hillary s main candidate committee, Hillary for America, as well as into the Democratic National Committee and 33 separate state Democratic committees, which has some observers crying foul.A recent article at CounterPunch, which questioned the ethics of the arrangement, quotes Paul Blumenthal, campaign finance reporter for the Huffington Post, as follows: It is a highly unusual arraignment if only because presidential candidates do not normally enter into fundraising agreements with their party s committees until after they actually win the nomination. And second, Clinton s fundraising committee is the first since the Supreme Court s 2014 McCutcheon v FEC decision eliminated aggregate contribution limits and congress increased party contribution limits in the 2014 omnibus budget bill. The Democratic National Committee has come under repeated fire for showing favoritism toward Hillary Clinton s candidacy versus that of Bernie Sanders. Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings show that the Hillary Victory Fund has given over $600,000 to the Democratic National Committee and tens of thousands of dollars each to the individual state committees that signed on to the joint fundraising plan.Hedge funds and private equity firms are desperate to hold on to their tax perversion known as  carried interest,  which allows their winnings to be taxed at rates lower than those paid by some plumbers and nurses. In no small part, it s how hedge fund operators ended up as billionaires, effectively subsidized by the wage earner.Federal Election Commission records show that S. Donald Sussman, founder of hedge fund Paloma Partners, gave $343,400 to the Hillary Victory Fund while also donating $2.5 million to Priorities USA, the Super Pac supporting Hillary.Hedge Fund billionaire George Soros donated $343,400 to the Hillary Victory Fund while sluicing a whopping $7 million into Priorities USA to enhance Hillary s efforts to move into the Oval Office.Jay T. Snyder of HBJ Investments, a private equity firm, gave over $300,000 to the Hillary Victory Fund.Dozens of other hedge fund and private equity operators gave lesser amounts to the Hillary Victory Fund. For example, Scott Shleifer of Tiger Global Management kicked in $167,000 while Mark Gallogly of Centerbridge Partners anted up $66,800.Other hedge fund billionaires have skipped the Hillary Victory Fund while writing out stunning amounts to the Super Pac supporting Hillary.On January 11 of this year, James Simons, the billionaire founder of hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, who now runs a family office called Euclidean Capital, wrote out a single check for $3.5 million to Priorities USA.According to the latest filing at the FEC, the Hillary Victory Fund joint fundraising committee has raised $26.9 million.According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Priorities USA has raised $55.6 million while Hillary s own campaign committee, Hillary for America, has raised $159.9 million.READ MORE US ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Election Files",Middle-east,"April 8, 2016"

23384,REVEALED: The CIA Ran LSD Sex Houses in San Francisco in 1950s and 60s,"Gary Kamiya SF ChronicleOn an elegant dead-end block on the north side of Telegraph Hill is 225 Chestnut St., a swanky modernist building with panoramic bay views. It s about the last place you would have expected to find a clandestine CIA program during the Cold War.Yet from 1955 to 1965, this building was the site of  Operation Midnight Climax    a top-secret mind-control program in which CIA agents used hookers to lure unsuspecting johns from North Beach bars to what they called  the pad,  then dosed the men with LSD and observed the X-rated goings-on through a two-way mirror while sitting on a portable toilet swilling martinis.As John Marks notes in his 1977 book,  The Search for the  Manchurian Candidate : The CIA and Mind Control,  the CIA s obsession with mind control had its origins during World War II, when the agency s predecessor, the Office of Strategic Services, set up a  truth drug  program whose purpose was to discover a substance that would make subjects reveal their secrets.The drug of choice was a concentrated liquid form of marijuana. The first field test in 1943 was administered to a New York mobster by George White, a tough-guy OSS captain who had been an agent in the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. The results were promising   White s sidekick said  every (subject) but one   and he didn t smoke   gave us more information than we had before    but ultimately inconclusive. Red enemyWhen the CIA was created in 1947, it continued to do mind-control experiments, with the enemy now being communism. Eastern bloc show trials like that of Hungarian Cardinal Jozsef Mindszenty, who in 1949 confessed to crimes he apparently did not commit, and reports of communist brainwashing during the Korean War led the CIA to fear there was a  mind-control gap  and that the U.S. was in second place.So the CIA authorized covert mind and behavior control programs. Drugs were given to people deemed expendable, including North Korean POWs, mental patients, prisoners, addicts and prostitutes. Before the programs were shot down, hundreds of scientists would work on them.In 1943, a Swiss chemist named Albert Hofmann developed an unbelievably powerful drug called LSD. When the technical branch of the CIA learned about this drug, the gung-ho head of its chemical division, a young chemist named Sidney Gottlieb, persuaded CIA official Richard Helms that the agency should investigate it as a spy tool. On April 13, 1953, CIA director Allen Dulles approved a program for  covert use of biological and chemical materials  with an initial budget of $300,000. Its name: MKULTRA.Dangerous gameThe CIA began to fund LSD projects at many institutions, including Columbia University and Mount Sinai Hospital. Informed consent and other moral niceties were dispensed with. One researcher kept seven subjects, junkies enticed by promises of hard drugs, on LSD for 77 straight days. No follow-up on them was ever done.The CIA was playing an extremely dangerous game. In 1953, Gottlieb dosed a CIA colleague, Frank Olson, causing Olson to undergo a mental crisis that ended with him falling to his death from a 10th-floor window. But this horrific incident only put MKULTRA temporarily on hold Continue this story at SF ChronicleREAD MORE CIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire CIA Files",Middle-east,"April 6, 2016"
23385,Utah Ranchers Vow to Stand Up to Government Abuse Despite Oregon Arrests,"Sam Levin The GuardianOn 23 January, a group of Utah ranchers gathered in Cedar City and made a pledge: they signed notices of  withdrawal of consent  to be governed   a statement rejecting the authority of the federal agencies that regulate grazing and charge fees to have livestock use public lands.The ranchers were following in the footsteps of Arizona rancher LaVoy Finicum, who at the time was a leader of a land-use protest at an Oregon wildlife refuge and who had publicly refused to pay for grazing rights.Then on 26 January, state troopers in Oregon shot and killed Finicum during an attempted arrest, and two weeks after that, federal authorities detained and charged Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher who led an armed standoff at his property in 2014. Utah rancher Todd Macfarlane at public hearing in February (Image Source: Salt Lake City Tribune)The aggressive prosecution of the unofficial leaders of the land-use rights movement in the west appeared to be the government s way of sending a clear message that authorities would not tolerate these types of protests.But in remote desert ranges of Utah, ranchers say they remain committed to finding a way to stand up to what they see as federal overreach and mistreatment   even if the most vocal activists leading the charge are now dead or behind bars.There are a number of factors that make Utah a key battleground in the brewing fight, with some questioning whether tensions could boil over and erupt in the form of another high-profile standoff and national controversy.Some in rural parts of central and southern Utah tell stories of extreme overreach by the government, alleging that the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and environmental advocacy groups have used endangered species regulations and conservation initiatives to prevent families from sustaining ranches passed down through generations Continue this story at The GuardianREAD MORE OREGON STANDOFF NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Oregon Standoff Files",Middle-east,"April 5, 2016"

In other words, little or reform took placing to prevent a new housing bubble which many experts are warning is due to manifest this year or next. But that s not the worst of it After all the trouble and strife, still, if you have a mortgage, banks are selling those loans to third parties many times and these new corporate  owners  of your home are then foreclosing, and evicting residents, sometimes for no reason at all. After they remove the residents, they then sell the property for well below market value   leaving the ex-homeowner to cover the difference in the price short-fall. Sound like a good deal?How do you fight this international racket? Here is one story from 2011 which we hope will still inspire some folks to start taking the ponzi banks to task  CBS NewsWarren and Maureen Nyerges paid cash when they bought a home from Bank of America in the Golden Gate Estates section of Collier, County, Fla., according to CBS affiliate WINK-TV in Ft. Myers.But that didn t stop Bank of America from trying to foreclose on them.They took their case to court and, a year-and-a-half later, the foreclosure action was dropped.A Collier County judge said Bank of America had to pay the couple s $2,534 legal fees, since it had made the mistake.After more than five months, the bank still hadn t paid up. So, the homeowners  lawyer, Todd Allen, began proceedings to did just what a bank would have to get its money: legally seize bank assets.On Friday, sheriff s deputies and moving vans showed up at the bank. I instructed the deputy to go in and take desks, computers, copiers, and filing cabinets, including cash in the drawers,  Allen says.Inside, says WINK,  The homeowners  attorney was locked out of the bank manager s office by deputies while the bank manger tried to figure out what to do.

23387,EXPOSED: How US-Backed War on Syria Helped ISIS to Expand Their Operations," ABC News PhotoDaniel Lazare Consortium NewsWhy are Islamic militants wreaking havoc from Brussels to Lahore? The best way to answer this question is by taking a close look at how The New York Times covered this weekend s liberation of Palmyra from Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi s Islamic State.The article, entitled  Syrian Troops Said to Recapture Historic Palmyra From ISIS,  began on a snide note. While the victory may have netted Bashar al-Assad  a strategic prize,  reporters Hwaida Saad and Kareem Fahim wrote that it also provided the Syrian president with  something more rare: a measure of international praise. The article noted that  Mr. Assad s contention that his government is a bulwark against the transnational extremist group  has been bolstered, but added that  his foes and some allies argue that he must leave power as part of a political settlement to end the war in Syria    without, of course, specifying who those allies might be.Then it offered a bit of background:  Lost in the celebrations was a discussion of how Palmyra had fallen in the first place. When the Islamic State captured the city in May [2015], the militants faced little resistance from Syrian troops. At the time, residents said officers and militiamen had fled into orchards outside the city, leaving conscripted soldiers and residents to face the militants alone. Since the Times claims to have  several hundred  surreptitious contacts inside Syria, the charge that Assad s troops fled without a fight may conceivably be correct. But it s hard to square with reports that the Islamic State (also known as ISIS, ISIL and Daesh) had to battle for seven or eight days before entering the city and then had to deal with a counter-offensive on the city s outskirts. But even if true, it s only part of the story and a small one at that.The real story began two months earlier when Syrian rebels launched a major offensive in Syria s northern Idlib province with heavy backing from Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Led by Al Nusra, the local Al Qaeda affiliate, but with the full participation of U.S.-backed rebel forces, the assault proved highly successful because of the large numbers of U.S.-made optically guided TOW missiles supplied by the Saudis. [See Consortiumnews.com s  Climbing into Bed with Al-Qaeda. ]The missiles gave the rebels the edge they needed to destroy dozens of government tanks and other vehicles according to videos posted on social media websites. Indeed, one pro-U.S. commander told The Wall Street Journal that the TOWs completely  flipped the balance of power,  enabling the rebels to dislodge the Syrian army s heavily dug-in forces and drive them out of town. Although the government soon counter-attacked, Al Nusra and its allies continued to advance to the point where they posed a direct threat to the Damascus regime s stronghold in Latakia province 50 or 60 miles to the west.Official Washington was jubilant. The trend lines for Assad are bad and getting worse,  a senior official crowed a month after the offensive began. The Times happily observed that  [t]he Syrian Army has suffered a string of defeats from re-energized insurgents   [which] raise newly urgent questions about the durability of President Bashar al-Assad s rule. Assad was on the ropes, or so everyone said. Indeed, ISIS thought so as well, according to the Associated Press, which is why it decided that the opportunity was ripe to launch an offensive of its own 200 miles or so to the southeast. Worn-out and depleted after four years of civil war, the Syrian Arab Army retreated before the onslaught.But considering the billions of dollars that the U.S. and Saudis were pouring into the rebel forces, blaming Damascus for not putting up a stiffer fight is a little like beating up a 12-year-old girl and then blaming her for not having a better right hook.So the U.S. and its allies helped Islamic State by tying down Assad s forces in the north so that it could punch through in the center. But that s not all the U.S. did. It also helped by suspending bombing as the Islamic State neared Palmyra.As the Times put it at the time:  Any airstrikes against Islamic State militants in and around Palmyra would probably benefit the forces of President Bashar al-Assad. So far, United States-led airstrikes in Syria have largely focused on areas far outside government control, to avoid the perception of aiding a leader whose ouster President Obama has called for. The upshot was a clear message to ISIS to the effect that it had nothing to worry about from U.S. jet bombers as long as it engaged Assad s troops in close combat. The U.S. thus incentivized ISIS to press forward with the assault. Although residents later wondered why the U.S. had not bombed ISIS forces  while they were traversing miles of open desert roads,  the answer, simply, is that Washington had other things on its mind. Rather than defeating ISIS, it preferred to use it to accomplish its primary goal, which was driving out Assad.The BlowbackBut what does this have to do with Brussels and Lahore? Simply that America s fundamental ambivalence toward ISIS, Al Qaeda, and similar groups   its policy of battling them on one hand and seeking to make use of them on the other  is what allows Sunni terrorism to fester and grow.The administration is shocked, SHOCKED, when Islamists kill innocent people in Belgium but not when they kill innocent people in Syria. This is why the White House long regarded ISIS as a lesser threat: because it thought its violence would remain safely contained. Where Al Qaeda s principal ambition is to launch attacks against the West and U.S. homeland,  Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes explained in August 2014,  ISIL s primary focus is consolidating territory in the Middle East region to establish their own Islamic State. Since the only people in harm s way were Syrians, there was no cause for alarm. The rest of the world could relax.Hence the confusion when ISIS did the unexpected by striking out at Western targets after all. As the Times observed in a major takeout this week on Islamic State s Western operations, officials were slow to connect the dots because Euro-terrorism was not supposed to be ISIS s thing:  Even as the group began aggressively recruiting foreigners, especially Europeans, policymakers in the United States and Europe continued to see it as a lower-profile branch of Al Qaeda that was mostly interested in gaining and governing territory. Turkish officials made essentially the same point last week in response to widespread complaints that they have done little to prevent Sunni terrorists from making their way to Syria. Not so, they countered. When they tried to return the jihadis from whence they came, they found that members of the European Union were none too eager to have them. We were suspicious that the reason they want these people to come is because they don t want them in their own countries,  a senior Turkish security official told the London Guardian. Instead, they preferred to see them continue on their way. And why not? At home, they would only cause trouble, whereas in Syria they would advance Western interests by waging war against Assad s Baathist government.Thus, Brussels was unresponsive when Turkish officials informed it that they had detained a Belgian citizen named Ibrahim el-Bakraoui in the border town of Gaziantep on suspicion of traveling to Syria to join the jihad. The Turks deported him anyway, but the Belgians remained unconcerned until El-Bakraoui turned up among the suicide bombers at Zaventem airport.The same thing happened when the Turks intercepted a Syria-bound French national named Omar Ismail Mostefai. Paris was also unresponsive until Mostefai wound up among the ISIS militants who stormed the Bataclan concert hall last November, at which point its attitude turned distinctly less blas .In June 2014, Turkish security officers in Istanbul intercepted a Norwegian citizen traveling to Syria with a camouflage outfit, a first-aid kit, knives, a gun magazine and parts of an AK-47, all of which E.U. customs officials had somehow overlooked.Two months later, they intercepted a German citizen with a suitcase containing a bulletproof vest, military camouflage and binoculars that customs had also failed to notice. When they apprehended a Danish-Turkish dual citizen on his way to Syria, they sent him back to Copenhagen. But the Danes gave him another passport regardless so he could continue on his way. Everyone figured that what happens in Syria stays in Syria, so why worry?Now, of course, everyone is worried big time. With the AP reporting that Islamic State has armed and trained 400 to 600 fighters for its European operations, talk of ISIS sleeper cells is ubiquitous. Referring to the Brussels district where the March 22 bombing plot was hatched, Patrick Kanner, the French social-democratic minister of youth, warned ominously:  There are today, as is well known, hundreds of neighborhoods in France that present potential similarities to what happened in Molenbeek. The implication was that the state of emergency should not only continue but deepen. As hundreds of neo-Nazis descended on Brussels chanting anti-immigrant slogans, paranoia took a giant leap forward as did its handmaidens racism and Islamophobia.But as much everyone would like to blame it all on Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen and others of that ilk, none of this is really their fault. To the contrary, the West s disastrous Syria policy is entirely the creation of nice-guy liberals like Barack Obama. Desperate to appease both Israel and the Sunni oil sheiks, all of whom for various reasons wanted Assad to go, he signed on to a massive Sunni jihad that has turned Syria into a charnel house.With death estimates now running as high as 470,000, which is to say one person in nine, the idea that massive violence like this could remain confined to a single country was absurd to begin with. Yet Obama went along regardless.Indeed, the administration is still unwilling to back down despite all that has happened since. When a reporter asked point-blank at a State Department press briefing,  Do you want to see the [Damascus] regime retake Palmyra or would you prefer that it stays in Daesh s hands,  spokesman Mark Toner hemmed and hawed before finally admitting that a takeover was preferable because  we think Daesh is probably the greater evil in this case. (Exchange starts at 1:05.)But the next day he walked back even that mealy-mouthed statement. Refusing to endorse Palmyra s fall at all, he declared:  I m not going to laud it because it s important to remember that one of the reasons Daesh is in Syria is because Assad s brutal crackdown on his own people created the kind of vacuum, if you will, that has allowed a group like ISIL or Daesh to flourish. Just because he s now, given the cessation of hostilities, willing and-or able to divert his forces to take on Daesh doesn t exonerate him or his regime from the gross abuses that they ve carried out against the Syrian people. Since Assad is the only one to blame, the U.S. doesn t have to ponder its own contribution to the problem. Instead, it gives itself a clean bill of health and moves on. Rather, it would like to move on if only ISIS would let it.But the more aid the U.S. and its allies funnel into the hands of Sunni terrorists, the more groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda will grow and the farther their reach will extend. The upshot will be more bombings and shootings in Paris, Brussels, and who knows where else. Racism and Islamophobia will continue to surge regardless of what bien-pensant liberals do to talk it down.The liberal center is engineering its own demise.***Daniel Lazare is the author of several books including The Frozen Republic: How the Constitution Is Paralyzing Democracy (Harcourt Brace).READ MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Syria Files",Middle-east,"April 4, 2016"
23388,IRAQ 1991: US Carpet Bombs ‘Highway of Death’,"ROAR MagI want to give testimony on what are called the  highways of death. These are the two Kuwaiti roadways, littered with remains of 2,000 mangled Iraqi military vehicles, and the charred and dismembered bodies of tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers, who were withdrawing from Kuwait on February 26th and 27th 1991 in compliance with UN resolutions.US planes trapped the long convoys by disabling vehicles in the front, and at the rear, and then pounded the resulting traffic jams for hours.  It was like shooting fish in a barrel,  said one US pilot. The horror is still there to see.On the inland highway to Basra is mile after mile of burned, smashed, shattered vehicles of every description   tanks, armored cars, trucks, autos, fire trucks, according to the March 18, 1991, Time magazine. On the sixty miles of coastal highway, Iraqi military units sit in gruesome repose, scorched skeletons of vehicles and men alike, black and awful under the sun, says the Los Angeles Times of March 11, 1991. While 450 people survived the inland road bombing to surrender, this was not the case with the 60 miles of the coastal road. There for 60 miles every vehicle was strafed or bombed, every windshield is shattered, every tank is burned, every truck is riddled with shell fragments. No survivors are known or likely. The cabs of trucks were bombed so much that they were pushed into the ground, and it s impossible to see if they contain drivers or not. Windshields were melted away, and huge tanks were reduced to shrapnel. Even in Vietnam I didn t see anything like this. It s pathetic,  said Major Bob Nugent, an Army intelligence officer. This one-sided carnage, this racist mass murder of Arab people, occurred while White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater promised that the US and its coalition partners would not attack Iraqi forces leaving Kuwait. This is surely one of the most heinous war crimes in contemporary history. The Iraqi troops were not being driven out of Kuwait by US troops as the Bush administration maintains. They were not retreating in order to regroup and fight again. In fact, they were withdrawing, they were going home, responding to orders issued by Baghdad, announcing that it was complying with Resolution 660 and leaving Kuwait. At 5:35 p.m. (Eastern standard Time) Baghdad radio announced that Iraq s Foreign Minister had accepted the Soviet cease-fire proposal and had issued the order for all Iraqi troops to withdraw to postions held before August 2, 1990 in compliance with UN Resolution 660. President Bush responded immediately from the White House saying (through spokesman Marlin Fitzwater) that  there was no evidence to suggest the Iraqi army is withdrawing. In fact, Iraqi units are continuing to fight. . . We continue to prosecute the war.  On the next day, February 26, 1991, Saddam Hussein announced on Baghdad radio that Iraqi troops had, indeed, begun to withdraw from Kuwait and that the withdrawal would be complete that day. Again, Bush reacted, calling Hussein s announcement  an outrage  and  a cruel hoax. Eyewitness Kuwaitis attest that the withdrawal began the afternoon of February 26, 1991 and Baghdad radio announced at 2:00 AM (local time) that morning that the government had ordered all troops to withdraw. The massacre of withdrawing Iraqi soldiers violates the Geneva Conventions of 1949, Common Article III, which outlaws the killing of soldiers who are out of combat. The point of contention involves the Bush administration s claim that the Iraqi troops were retreating to regroup and fight again. Such a claim is the only way that the massacre which occurred could be considered legal under international law. But in fact the claim is false and obviously so. The troops were withdrawing and removing themselves from combat under direct orders from Baghdad that the war was over and that Iraq had quit and would fully comply with UN resolutions. To attack the soldiers returning home under these circumstances is a war crime.Iraq accepted UN Resolution 660 and offered to withdraw from Kuwait through Soviet mediation on February 21, 1991. A statement made by George Bush on February 27, 1991, that no quarter would be given to remaining Iraqi soldiers violates even the US Field Manual of 1956. The 1907 Hague Convention governing land warfare also makes it illegal to declare that no quarter will be given to withdrawing soldiers. On February 26,199 I, the following dispatch was filed from the deck of the USS. Ranger, under the byline of Randall Richard of the Providence Journal: Air strikes against Iraqi troops retreating from Kuwait were being launched so feverishly from this carrier today that pilots said they took whatever bombs happened to be closest to the flight deck. The crews, working to the strains of the Lone Ranger theme, often passed up the projectile of choice . . . because it took too long to load. New York Times reporter Maureen Dowd wrote,  With the Iraqi leader facing military defeat, Mr. Bush decided that he would rather gamble on a violent and potentially unpopular ground war than risk the alternative: an imperfect settlement hammered out by the Soviets and Iraqis that world opinion might accept as tolerable. In short, rather than accept the offer of Iraq to surrender and leave the field of battle, Bush and the US military strategists decided simply to kill as many Iraqis as they possibly could while the chance lasted Continue this story at ROAR MagazineREAD MORE IRAQ NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Iraq Files",Middle-east,"April 3, 2016"

The Turkish MP who broke this story was then charged with treason by the Erdogan government. If that wasn t enough, Turkey then began a campaign of state oppression by targeting journalists and newspapers who were critical of leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan s political machine (still clinging to power in Ankara). The embattled authoritarian regime then took its act on the road, to a city which always welcomes its dictators with open arms  Washington DC.Unfortunately, Erdogan s henchmen thought they were still in Ankara when they attacked journalists and protesters yesterday in the nation s capital. Erdogan s thugs forgot they were in the US, where some press and citizens still have rights.As expected, total silence on the incident by President Obama and his US State Department. Silence is consent. Of course, if this happened at a Donald Trump event, we would never hear the end of it from the media and the Obama administration   but because it s by a NATO member (and an actual fascist government), well then, that s perfectly acceptable for mandarins in Washington.Clearly, Turkey s media crackdown knows no borders  RTThe security detail for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan clashed with opposing activists for the second day in a row in Washington, DC, removing journalists and even confronting city police after law enforcement refused to remove protesters from the area.With Erdogan set to give a speech at the Brookings Institute on Thursday, a group of protesters opposing his crackdown on free speech in Turkey, his government s treatment of the country s Kurdish population, and what they say is his tolerance of Islamic State, gathered near the DC-based think tank to express their opposition.Protesters chanting"" #Erdogan is commander in chief of ISIS"" outside the Brookings where he is speaking soon pic.twitter.com/EE1akSSHeO  Paulina Leonovich (@Polly_evro) March 31, 2016The scene quickly devolved into chaos as demonstrators tried to get closer to Brookings, with journalists tweeting that Erdogan s security scuffled with protesters.Erdogan s security detail became physical with reporters, removing one journalist from Brookings, kicking another, and throwing a female reporter to the sidewalk, according to Foreign Policy magazine.Journalist Adem Yavuz Arslan has been kicked out of #Brookings building by Erdogan's men.

Quietly, president Barack Obama is deploying more and more US troops in Iraq, not necessarily to  fight ISIS , but firstly to guard the Iraqi oil fields.Notice how this announcement is perfectly timed with the Iraqi Army s military offensive this week to retake the supposed  ISIS stronghold  of Mosul in Northern Iraq.Will a new Kurdistan rise from the ashes of this geopolitical conundrum, or will it just be more instability?There s more to this new trend than meets the eye. Watch this space  Fighting Centers on Key Town of MakhmurJason Ditz  Antiwar.comEven as Pentagon officials have sought to emphasize their claims of ISIS being  on the run,  ever more US ground troops are being deployed into Iraq to try to cope with ISIS offensives, with the battle of Makhmur leading to the introduction of US Marines in front-line combat roles.Officials are trying to downplay the operation as  force protection  for Iraqi ground troops, who have been massing in the area in an effort to ultimately launch an attack on the ISIS-held city of Mosul, not far away.The explanation is unsatisfying for several reasons, but primarily because this  tactical assembly area  already includes thousands of Iraqi troops and Kurdish Peshmerga, and these are the same troops who are supposed to attack Mosul. Yet these troops are apparently unable to even hold Makhmur, let alone advance toward Mosul.The Makhmur District is also a key to holding oil fields around Kirkuk, and the ISIS offensive is seen by many analysts as part of an effort to ultimately regain control over those lucrative oil fields, and have been  outgunning  the thousands of Iraqi troops in the area.Whether they re trying to save Iraqi ground troops who still can t stand up to ISIS, or save oil fields, however, the latest escalation puts US troops even further in harm s way, and has put the war even further afield from the  no boots on the ground  affair initially promised by the Obama Administration.READ MORE IRAQ NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Iraq Files",Middle-east,"March 27, 2016"

Ron Paul was originally slated to speak, but the convention was cancelled for that evening due to the threat of a  hurricane.  The hurricane turned out to be no more than a brisk rainstorm. Rachael and many other Ron Paul delegates braved it that morning and went to the convention center (the Tampa Bay Times Forum, a sports complex) to watch Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus officially proclaim the delay. After the gravel had been struck and the chairman left the stage, the delegates found themselves watching a movie glorifying Mitt Romney. At the film s conclusion, Rachael heard ear-splitting applause. But when she looked around, almost no one was cheering. The applause was  canned the type sports stadiums pipe in when the home team is losing and their spectators show low enthusiasm.The next day at her hotel, Rachael s husband called and said:  Hey, I watched it yesterday and the crowd was really diggin  Romney.  Rachael had to break the news: what he (and the rest of America) heard on TV had been faked.The real blow to the Ron Paul people came when the Republican National Committee made last-minute rule changes. Under the existing rules, Paul had won enough primaries and caucuses (five) to have his name placed in nomination. Under the newrules, the required number of states would be increased to eight, thus rendering Paul s nomination impossible. Mitt Romney, who had already won sufficient delegates through dirty tricks during the primaries to become the  presumptive nominee,  would also be granted power to replace duly elected delegates with people of his own choosing.Naturally, Paul s delegates were anxious to vote on the rule changes. However, the convention busses showed up at their hotels late. The driver of Rachael s bus didn t seem to know the way to the convention center, got stuck in traffic, and took about two hours to complete the trip. By the time most of the Paul delegates reached the center, and passed through its heavy security, the vote was already over. Mitt Romney would be the Republican Convention s  unanimous  choice.Ron Paul was still offered a chance to make a speech, but only under two conditions: (1) that he endorse Romney; and (2) that the Republic National Committee first vet and approve the speech. Under these conditions, Paul acted on integrity and declined to speak.A word should be added about the media in Tampa. On the convention s last day, Rachael dressed up in funeral black and handed out cards offering condolences to America upon the loss of the democratic process. She gave one to a leading news journalist who said  I love it.  When Rachael asked if he would do a story on it, he literally replied:  It doesn t fit the pre-scripted narrative. Sorry. That the media was bound to a  pre-scripted narrative  was later proven when a brawl broke out between the Romney and Paul delegates, complete with screaming, pushing and shoving, right by the entrance to the press boxes (CNN, Fox, MSNBC, etc.). Although the brawl should have been  news,  not a single journalist emerged with a camera to record it. After all, it didn t fit the  pre-scripted narrative namely, that Republicans unanimously supported Mitt Romney.What lesson can we draw from Rachael s experience? The same one that people have been learning the hard way for decades: that regardless of much you work for a Presidential candidate, the PTB (Powers That Be) will railroad their candidate to the top. The following quote from my 1988 book The Shadows of Power refers to the election year of 1952:At the Republican nominating convention,  dirty tricks  abounded. The rules for selecting delegates were changed: Taft delegations from Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas were thrown out and replaced by Eisenhower supporters. I.e., the same sort of tactics that Ron Paul s supporters faced in 2012 were used at the GOP Convention 60 years earlier. I ll add that Dwight Eisenhower had no previous affiliation with the Republican Party; the Democratic Party had tried to draft him in 1948, and President Harry Truman (Democrat) had approached him about running on the same ticket. Above: Nixon and Eisenhower at the 1952 conventionLet s kick it back to 1940. Seven weeks before the GOP Convention, a poll showed only three percent of Republicans favored candidate Wendell Willkie, who, prior to that year, had been a registered Democrat. But with powerful magic, Willkie got the nomination. Ten-term Congressman Usher Burdick of North Dakota said of this:We Republicans in the west want to know if Wall Street and the international bankers control our party and can select our candidate? I believe I am serving the best interests of the Republican Party by protesting and exposing the machinations and attempts of J.P. Morgan and the New York utility bankers in forcing Wendell Willkie on the Republican Party. . . .There is nothing to the Willkie boom for President except the artificial public opinion being created by newspapers, magazines, and the radio. The reason back of all this is money. Money is being spent by someone, and lots of it. PHOTO: Wendell Willkie PHOTO: Usher Burdick (right) in 1958 with Ezra PoundFor those who wonder if such phenomena only happen to Republicans, Bernie Sanders can already  feel the spurn.  He won New Hampshire by a landslide (60 to 38 percent) only to discover that Hillary Clinton had been awarded the majority of delegates. This is because the Democratic Party has 717  superdelegates  who support whomever they prefer, regardless of the wishes of voters or primary results.Go back to 1976. According to a Gallup poll, just seven months before the Democratic National Convention, less than four percent of Democratic voters favored Jimmy Carter for President. What happened? As Lawrence Shoup noted in The Carter Presidency and Beyond:What Carter had that his opponents did not was the acceptance and support of elite sectors of the mass communications media. It was their favorable coverage of Carter and his campaign that gave him an edge, propelling him rocket-like to the top of the opinion polls. This helped Carter win key primary election victories, enabling him to rise from an obscure public figure to President-elect in the short space of 9 months.How did Carter acquire this media following? It began at a dinner with Republican David Rockefeller  kingmaker of the Establishment at the latter s Tarrytown, New York estate. Also present was Zbigniew Brzezinski, who helped Rockefeller found the internationalist Trilateral Commission, and whom Carter would later appoint National Security Adviser. The media blitz included adulatory pieces in the New York Times, and a Wall Street Journal editorial declaring that Carter was the best Democratic candidate. Before the nominating convention, his picture appeared on the cover of Time three times, and Newsweek twice. Time s cover artists were even instructed to make him look as much as possible like John F. Kennedy. The TV networks inundated the public with his image.As former Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater said:David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski found Jimmy Carter to be their ideal candidate. They helped him win the nomination and the presidency. To accomplish this purpose, they mobilized the money power of the Wall Street bankers, the intellectual influence of the academic community   which is subservient to the wealth of the great tax-free foundations   and the media controllers represented in the membership of the CFR and the Trilateral.If you want to glimpse how far back this sort of power-brokering goes, read Ferdinand Lundberg s 1937 classic America s Sixty Families. He related how, a century ago, the rich were scorning voters and maneuvering their own choices into nominations, whether a Democrat like Woodrow Wilson in 1912 or a Republican like Herbert Hoover in 1928.The 2016 RaceWhat about this year? Who have the  PTB  anointed to become President? While I am of course not privy to their conclaves, I believe their chosen one, as I stated in my blog post of February 15, is Hillary Clinton. There are several indicators:(1) Despite her  anti-Wall Street  rhetoric, Hillary receives by far the most donations from Wall Street of any candidate. Jeb Bush competed with her for that distinction, but since Jeb s personality proved too lackluster to muster enough votes to stay in the race, Hillary holds the honor alone. Above: Hillary partakes in groundbreaking ceremony for Goldman Sachs  new headquarters in 2005. (2) Of the viable candidates, only Hillary is committed to 100 percent of the Rothschild agenda:  pro  War on Terror    pro Israel   pro gun control   pro GMO (Monsanto)   pro population control (abortion, vaccines, etc.)   pro  climate change  control   pro mass immigration   pro Internet censorship   pro gay agenda   pro TPP (she is currently backing off on this because of voter concern about jobs, but before running she said  This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements, and was a strong proponent of the job-destroying NAFTA and GATT agreements)(3) I ll interject here that Rachael McIntosh told me she believes that in 2008, an understanding was reached concerning Obama and Clinton, both of whom were running that year. Obama would become the first black President; Hillary s turn would arrive in due time, and she would become the first woman President. Having a black or woman in the Oval Office, of course, gives the public the illusion that they are  empowered  and that the Establishment has somehow been stymied, whereas in fact both Obama and Hillary are flunkies for the Establishment. I agree with Rachael s assessment 100 percent.And so it was that Obama appointed Hillary his Secretary of State, a move clearly intended to give her a  foreign policy expertise  credential for the 2016 Presidential campaign. After Clinton left the position (2013), CBS began airing (2014) its still-running drama Madam Secretary, all about a blonde woman Secretary of State. Subliminal Advertising: Hollywood began campaigning for Hillary Clinton in 2014.  Beginning with the very first episode, in which  Madam Secretary  rescued American hostages held in Syria, viewers would receive a weekly dose of subliminal propaganda for Hillary s campaign, portraying her as beautiful, heroic, honest and competent.(4) Prior to being Secretary of State, Hillary served as U.S. Senator from New York. She had never lived in New York before, but the state is the center of America s banking industry, and has been a launching point for Presidential candidates such as the Roosevelts. Serving a Senate term, of course, would also give Hillary an important  can work with Congress  credential for her Presidential run. There is considerable Internet buzz that John F. Kennedy, Jr., who had long lived in New York, was planning to run for the Senate in 2000, the same year as Clinton. The handsome son of the popular President would likely have defeated Clinton, adding interest to Kennedy s death in a suspicious plane crash on July 16, 1999, especially in light of what has been termed the Clinton Body Count.(5) Perhaps most importantly, the Establishment has already marked Hillary with their stamp of approval by entrusting her with two terms in the White House. Yes, Bill Clinton was President then, but if Hillary is elected, Bill will of course be returning.Will the email or Benghazi scandals derail her Presidential bid? I doubt it. During Bill s tenure, the Clintons were plagued by innumerable scandals besides mysterious deaths: sex charges, perjury, Whitewater,  Chinagate,   Travelgate,  drug allegations connected with his Arkansas governorship, Hillary s incredible cattle futures profits, etc. Yet although many pundits back then claimed these scandals would lead to impeachment, the Clintons always remained untouched by justice. So far, nothing seems to have changed. However, Hillary s scandals do give the Establishment a blackmailer s leash on her; i.e., if she ever steps out of line, prosecutions could suddenly materialize.What about the other candidates currently running? All of them share some of Hillary s positions, but none do 100 percent. Bernie Sanders is too opposed to banker bailouts to be acceptable, even though the Establishment is OK with his socialism (since, in an illusional democracy, empowering government empowers them). Cruz s wife Heidi is a former term member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a vice president at Goldman Sachs, from whom Cruz s Senate campaign received a million-dollar loan; but his positions on matters like abortion, gun control and immigration don t pass muster Continue this story at James PerloffREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"March 22, 2016"

23403,Clinton Emails: How Google Worked With Hillary to Try and Overthrow Syria’s Assad,"21st Century Wire says The Silicon Valley s technotronic oligarchy has been exposed as a mere extension of the CIA in terms of playing a role in Washington s state policy of regime change in Syria.This latest email release reveals how then US Secretary of State, and now Democratic presidential favorite Hillary Clinton colluded with executives at Google to launch a digital PR onslaught against the president of Syria, Bashar al Assad. This is all part of Google s  color revolution business, and also part of the Smart Power Complex used to manufacture public consent for humanitarian interventions  globally.The leak also reveals how Qatari network Al Jazeera played an active role in this plot too. Al Jazeera has already been caught repeatedly manipulating international news throughout the Middle East.In a just world, Hillary would be held to account by the mainstream media for this revelation, but it seems that it s just being ignored by the mainstream gatekeepers  Rudy Takala Washington ExaminerGoogle in 2012 sought to help insurgents overthrow Syrian President Bashar Assad, according to State Department emails receiving fresh scrutiny this week.Messages between former secretary of state Hillary Clinton s team and one of the company s executives detailed the plan for Google to get involved in the region. Please keep close hold, but my team is planning to launch a tool   that will publicly track and map the defections in Syria and which parts of the government they are coming from,  Jared Cohen, the head of what was then the company s  Google Ideas  division, wrote in a July 2012 email to several top Clinton officials. Our logic behind this is that while many people are tracking the atrocities, nobody is visually representing and mapping the defections, which we believe are important in encouraging more to defect and giving confidence to the opposition,  Cohen said, adding that the plan was for Google to surreptitiously give the tool to Middle Eastern media.Hillary Emails: Google tried to boost Assad defections https://t.co/lyma4eJp9a More: https://t.co/ZUfh7WDAT5 pic.twitter.com/nvNG0lFJWt  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 19, 2016 Given how hard it is to get information into Syria right now, we are partnering with Al-Jazeera who will take primary ownership over the tool we have built, track the data, verify it, and broadcast it back into Syria,  he said. Please keep this very close hold and let me know if there is anything [else] you think we need to account for or think about before we launch. We believe this can have an important impact,  Cohen concluded The message was addressed to deputy secretary of state Bill Burns; Alec Ross, a senior Clinton advisor; and Clinton s deputy chief of staff, Jake Sullivan. Sullivan subsequently forwarded Cohen s proposal to Clinton, describing it as  a pretty cool idea. Cohen worked as a low-level staffer at the State Department until 2010, when he was hired to lead Google Ideas, but was tied to the use of social media to incite social uprisings even before he left the department.

23405,ART OF WAR: What’s Behind Russia’s ‘Ides of March’ Military Drawdown in Syria?," Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.    Sun Tzu, The Art of War21st Century Wire asks What s behind Russia s decision to drawdown military support in Syria?  MAKING A DEAL    Putin making a strategic deal before the Geneva III talks. (Photo link theaustralian)This week Russia scaled back its military campaign against ISIS targets in Syria, after systematically directing months of successful airstrikes on terror groups within the embattled nation.Russia s partial departure and tenuous cease-fire in Syria, is a symbolic one, not only for the haunting  Ides of March  historical significance, but also because it marks the five-year anniversary of Syria s so-called  Arab Spring. When the campaign to topple Syrian leadership first began, we were told there was a legitimate grass-roots uprising sweeping across North Africa then through Middle East. The mainstream media gleefully exulted it s praise as an organic movement of change, widely hailed as the  Arab Spring . While the  Spring  was sold to the public as a large protest movement, it was proven to be a well orchestrated socially engineered political uprising used to gain a foothold over Syria   opening the door for Western intervention.Back in February, 21WIRE reported that ISIS jihadists were in fact fleeing from Syria, following the destruction of their operational bases within the country: Colonel Steve Warren of the US-led coalition said the terror group s leadership has shifted its base of operations from Syria and Iraq, into Libya after facing immense bombardment: We believe this failure is due to several factors, the first and foremost I believe is the presence of devastating coalition air power. The Whitehouse added that ISIS is also now seeking to send jihadist recruits into Libya instead of Syria and Iraq. While US leadership mentioned that devastating coalition air power  led to Syria s good fortune, it failed to directly discuss Russia s large role in silencing ISIS and other known militant fighting groups (some of who are still referred to by Washington as  moderate rebels ) through air campaigns of their own.To anyone paying attention to the battleground in Syria, the message was clear   Washington now fully acknowledges the eventual eradication of many ISIS fighters, leading US policy makers to rethink their regime change strategy.Recently, 21WIRE discussed a more cynical lens with which to view the cease-fire deal in Syria, noting that this peace agreement, could very well turn out to be a political ploy crafted by Pentagon war makers looking to re-arm militants in the region: This latest diplomatic development certainly appears positive on its surface, this week s declared  Syrian Ceasefire    a three-way agreement between Washington, Russia and the Syrian government (and begrudgingly by the West s other regional  stakeholders ) looks increasingly like it may just be the latest attempt to buy time   so that Washington, Turkey and Saudi Arabia can re-arm and replenish various militant fighting groups currently laying waste to Syria. Continuing, we see the West s failure following the loss of proxy militants and why this brokered deal is perhaps their only political play at the moment: The Washington-led Axis has gradually lost proxy-control of a number of key terrorist strongholds in Northern Syria, namely in Aleppo, and thus are unable to dictate crucial  facts on the ground  required to dictate the international media and political narratives. Unable to craft and package these narratives, the West and its dubious  coalition  are completely unable to sell an escalation of military violence in Syria. From a propaganda perspective, the latest military move by Russia has prompted policy makers at Western think-tanks to characterize the strategic decision as a sign of a rift between Putin and Assad   but as we ll see in the Sputnik News article below, the timing of the military drawdown has everything to do with the upcoming peace talk negotiations in Geneva.More from Sputnik below   ART OF WAR    Syria s struggles appear to move from the battlefield to the boardroom. (Photo illustration Shawn Helton of 21WIRE)Andrew KorybkoSputnik NewsThe Western and Mideast mainstream media are frenziedly spinning Russia s planned drawdown from Syria as a military defeat and a betrayal of its key ally, but just exactly who is betraying whom? President Putin announced that Russia will begin drawing down its military forces in Syria on 15 March, popularly known as the Ides of March and infamous for being the day that Emperor Julius Caesar was stabbed to death by his own allies.While it may have been chosen innocently enough, the date is rich with symbolism and is quite fitting in describing the changing dynamics that are presently at play in the Mideast.On this peculiar day of the year when things are typically not as they may initially seem to be, what s being popularly portrayed as a  defeat  and  betrayal  is anything but, while the ones doing the premature celebrating are ironically the very same forces that should be concerned the most.Nearly two millennia after the Ides of March were fatefully enshrined in history, it s no longer the Roman Emperor that s being betrayed by his allies, but the Turkish and Saudi ones that are being backstabbed by the US.The DrawdownPresidents Putin and Assad coordinated the decision to decrease the Russian troop presence in Syria, agreeing that the anti-terrorist operation had completed its stated aims of  combating terrorism and the restoration of security and stability to many regions in Syria .In particular, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu proclaimed that his country  carried out more than 9,000 flights  which contributed to  the Syrian troops liberating 400 towns and over 10,000 square kilometres of territory. The reader is encouraged to consult The Saker s latest article if they re interested in a detailed analysis of everything that Russia has accomplished thus far, but the present piece will now move on to describing the intent behind the drawdown and the contingency measures that are in place for defending Syria from any large-scale aggression against it.From the Battlefield to the Boardroom:Russia s announcement was timed to coincide with the resumption of the Geneva III talks and clearly carries with it the symbolic message that Moscow is doubling down on its diplomatic commitment in resolving the War on Syria.A de-jure partition is absolutely off the table and prohibited by UNSC Res. 2254, but there s a creeping fear among many that a de-facto one could occur if federalization is ever implemented.It s perhaps for this reason why the Syrian government and its people are currently not in favor of this approach, and for curious readers who are wondering exactly what could be so bad about federalization, the author welcomes them to read his earlier published research on the topic that s available at Russia s National Institute for Research of Global Security.After five and a half months of operation, Russia s anti-terrorist air operation has succeeded in the herculean task of bringing the War on Syria to its final logical phase, which is the protracted negotiation process that has just recommenced.The conflict has thus shifted from the battlefield to the boardroom, but in the lamentable event that foreign actors influence their political surrogates to sabotage the ongoing talks and reinitiate large-scale hostilities, Russia has a few back-up measures up its sleeve to make sure that Syria isn t left unsecured.More at Sputnik News READ MORE SYRIAN NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 21st Century Wire Syria Files ",Middle-east,"March 18, 2016"

Currently, FOIA requests are handled by each separate agency, each with its own rules about how to submit a request. Today s vote sends a clear message that the American people have a fundamental right to know what their government is doing,  Cornyn said.( ) We cannot leave it to the next president to decide how open the government should be,  Leahy said.  We have to hold all presidents and their administrations accountable to the highest standard. Republicans in Congress have complained that the Obama administration hasn t been fully transparent in sharing records with lawmakers and the public, while the White House has criticized Congress for exempting itself from the requirements. FOIA does not apply to Congress.The House passed a similar bill in January. Because the two bills are not identical, the House will have to act again to send the legislation to President Barack Obama. Maryland Rep. Rep.

After all this, the quislings at the The Oregonian are still trying to tart-up this FBI and OSP debacle by calling it a  traffic stop . While forced to now admit that there was foul play on the infallible government s part, mainstream media gatekeepers are still trying to paint the incident as a  traffic stop    which is beyond a joke.Get ready for another government-issued  magic bullet  fairy tale to protect the hired guns.How long before we can call this an assassination? New findings by law enforcement officials suggest that an FBI agent on the scene of the fatal shooting of Bundy-affiliated protester LaVoy Finicum during a Jun. 26 felony stop might have fired two shots that were not reported, and agents on the scene might have disposed of bullet casings to cover them up.According to The Oregonian, investigators believe that the shots were fired approximately at the moment at which LaVoy Finicum was exiting his truck with his hands up, prior to when he appears to reach into his jacket and is shot by two Oregon State Police troopers. The above-embedded slow-motion video shows the moment at which investigators believe the shots were fired.Deschutes County Sheriff Shane Nelson and Malheur County District Attorney Dan Norri, who investigated the incident, concluded that the Oregon State Police officers were justified in shooting Finicum, but also announced that they believe that an FBI agent took two unreported shots and then lied about it. The U.S. Department of Justice has subsequently launched a criminal investigation into the conduct of the FBI agents on the scene.The Oregonian s Les Zaitz wrote,  A state trooper later described to investigators seeing two rifle casings in the area where the [FBI] agents were posted. Detectives tasked with collecting evidence didn t find the casings, police reports indicate. He added,  FBI aerial surveillance video shows that before the detectives could get there, the FBI agents searched the area with flashlights and then huddled, according to law enforcement sources who have seen the video. The group then broke and one agent appeared to bend over twice and pick up something near where the two shots likely were taken. Police reports indicate that detectives showed up to collect evidence around 90 minutes after the moment in the surveillance video in which the FBI agent appeared to pick items up from the ground.All of the FBI agents on the scene that day claimed that they did not take any shots. A state trooper said he had fired three shots while the truck was speeding towards police and two more at Finicum as he was reaching into his jacket after he had exited the vehicle. Police inventory records show that the trooper was missing five rounds after the incident, apparently confirming his story.A fourth bullet hole in the truck came from a different angle of trajectory suggesting that an FBI agent had fired the shot. Investigators believe a second shot, which missed Finicum and did not strike the truck, was also fired by an FBI agent Continue this story at Truth In MediaREAD MORE OREGON STANDOFF NEWS: 21st Century Wire Oregon Files",Middle-east,"March 17, 2016"

23409,Coke Zero: What Went Wrong With The Marco Rubio Brand?,"Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireAny business expert will tell you that marketing is not an exact science. The same is true in politics, and even more so in this historic election season. As the polls closed yesterday, Republican candidate and US Senator Marco Rubio took to the podium to announce he was finally bowing out the GOP presidential primary race. Front runner Donald Trump nearly swept the board starting with Rubio s home state of Florida, followed by Illinois, North Carolina, Missouri and in US territory Mariana Islands, while Ohio governor John Kasich took the remaining contest winning his first primary race ,in his home state.With 99 delegates at stake in a winner take all contest, Florida was meant to be Rubio s gallant last stand. Even though the polls showed Rubio trailing in double digits before Tuesday, Rubio still insisted he was going to win, and even go on to win the nomination.Marco: A smile you can trust.. Quite frankly, I think a lot of people are going to be embarrassed tonight and are going to want refunds from the money they spent on those polls because we re going to win Florida,  said Rubio.  We feel very optimistic about that. When it was all said and done, Trump beat Rubio 46% to 27% in Florida. A blow out.By the end of his long drive, Rubio had only managed to win one state caucus in Minnesota, leaving him with no real primary victory. To his investors, the truth of the  matter might be almost too painful to comprehend  that beyond all the hype, their man was really a bottom tier candidate.Super Tuesday s humiliating loss was indicative of a Rubio rise  that never rose. Before Tuesday s defeat, no matter how poorly Florida Senator Marco Rubio showed in previous primary elections, and no matter how badly he was polling in his home state of Florida   the media, led by CNN and FOX News, still covered his campaign like he was winning the election. Clearly, there was a concerted and well-coordinated effort by the Republican establishment and major broadcast media outlets to promote Rubio s candidacy well above the actual candidate s weight division.Three weeks ago, in a last-ditch effort to elevate his poll numbers, Rubio tried to out-Trump Trump, by unleashing his own round of back-ally personal verbal insults at the front runner in the hope of pulling The Donald back down to earth. Rubio began publicly calling Trump a  con man  and asserted that Trump had not achieved anything in his business career and along with fellow competitor Ted Cruz, inferred that the billionaire property and entertainment mogul Trump had inherited $200 million dollars from his late father and therefore was not deserving of any accolades. When Trump would joke about Rubio s lack of height (Rubio is 5 8  and Trump is 6 2 ), Rubio hit back joking,  look how small Donald s hands are, and you what they say about men with small hands..  to his crowds roaring with laughter before the Texas primary three weeks earlier.Trump finally hit back with a moniker that Rubio could never shake, renaming him  Little Marco.  LITTLE MARCO: Trump s crude deconstruction of Rubio delivered the final blow.Although their cage match pulled more TV airtime and attention away from a Trump-obsessed media, in the end it backfired horribly for Marco, as America got an uncomfortable snapshot of a nasty and desperate Rubio   hardly the look of stability, moderation and  unity that Rubio marketeers were trying to project, and hardly presidential either.What was most telling about Rubio s response to a situation, partly of his own making, was that Rubio shirked any responsibility for ratcheting-up the rhetoric, and instead tried to blame Trump for the degrading  tone  of the election: This is a frightening, grotesque and disturbing development in American politics,  Rubio said of the violence.  We are being ripped apart at the seams now,  he continued.  I m sad for this country. This is supposed to be the example to the world of how a republic functions and instead people are watching third-world images last night coming out of Chicago. It was too late. The damage was already done. Some pundits were calling it  political suicide  by Rubio   a gross error of political miscalculation on his part. But this would be missing the point because in reality, beyond all the incredible marketing hype, Rubio s campaign never achieved any serious market penetration to begin with.It s important to remember that the establishment firmly believed, and still to this day, that Marco Rubio could be the Republican Party s answer to the marketing sensation that was Barack Obama in 2008. By capitalizing on his youth and his Latino profile, the GOP elite saw this as a  turn-key  marketing solution. Just like a soda pop brand, party and media operatives believed that by positioning Rubio s brand in a highbrow market tier, voters would make the necessary connections and move to act by casting their vote for him. DETATCHED: Darryl Issa throws himself under the bus,, desperate to inflate Rubio before Super Tuesday.On Super Tuesday, the transmission truly fell out of the Rubio marketing machine. After months of boasting about how he would win his home state, Rubio plugger and California Congressman Darryl Issa (R), insisted that,  Marco is leading in early (voting) returns in Florida. Seriously, Congressman Issa?Issa appeared to be carrying water for the GOP establishment by doing the last minute media rounds for kingmaker Mitt Romney, who weeks earlier dropped the gauntlet down on the Trump train during a speech at the University of Utah. Romney,  a former Republican presidential candidate and Massachusetts governor implored his GOP herd to join forces and stop Trump by splitting the votes by voting for Kasich in Ohio, and for Rubio in Florida. Romney hoped  that his divide and conquer strategy would rob Trump of the delegate majority needed to secure the GOP nomination before the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio this July. JET-SET: Rubio taking instructions from elite off-shoring corporate raider Mitt Romney.Clearly, Romney had staked his claim behind Marco Rubio then, which means that Rubio s collapse in Florida has half deflated Romney s Revolt.Romney continued to dig a hole for himself in Florida before Super Tuesday by recording an automated  Robo-call used to phone prospective Marco Rubio voters in Florida, nearly begging voters to cast ballots for,  a candidate who can defeat Hillary Clinton and who can make us proud. The recorded message went on:  If we Republicans were to choose Donald Trump as our nominee, I believe that the prospects for a safe and prosperous future would be greatly diminished   and I m convinced Donald Trump would lose to Hillary Clinton. Making Robo-calls for a candidate who people were already calling  a Robot , wasn t exactly a smart move by Romney.Far from swinging the election towards Rubio, what Mitt Romney really proved was that money and power can t buy common sense.Ghost RunFor anyone who actually bothered to look close enough, hints of Rubio s collapse were everywhere, but you wouldn t know if from media coverage over the last two months. If not for favorable network face-time on the GOP TV debates, along with Rubio s elite financier backers like billionaire Paul Singer and Cayman hedge fund raider Romney, it s safe to say that Rubio s numbers might had been well below those of his fellow non-starter, Ohio Governor John Kasich.Rubio-linked multi-million dollar Super PAC funds pulled out all the stops against Trump too, launching a social media tidal wave of anti-Trump messages before the Florida primary:If every Rubio supporter makes 1 phone call #MarcoRubio will win! Convince 1 voter to vote for Marco! #CallForMarco pic.twitter.com/d8wOKZWFA4  Stop Trump PAC (@StopTrumpPAC) March 15, 2016Last Wednesday, Rubio hired out a football stadium to stage a homecoming rally in his own state. Unfortunately, no one showed up. TV cameras had to be moved forward into a tiny area around the field s goal posts in order to make the rally look as if more than a few hundred people bothered to show up. Far from jovial and inspirational, the atmosphere was that of deflation and despondency. It was tragic.Rubio stadium event in Hialeah. Stands empty; crowd in one end zone. pic.twitter.com/9zj0xslwSA  Byron York (@ByronYork) March 9, 2016 And when the cameras zoomed-in, it looked like this:The crowd in Hialeah is fired up for @marcorubio tonight! #FLforMarco #FLPrimary pic.twitter.com/e34GsoWWwH  Team Marco (@TeamMarco) March 9, 2016CNN had dispatched one of its intrepid city-dwelling reporters, Jason Carroll, out to Hialeah, Florida to  cover the event. Carrol tried be nice about it, describing the event as  much, much smaller  than a  normal  Rubio event. So much for Marco s homecoming, and so much for Mitt Romney s plan to have Marco win his home state to force a brokered convention in July.If Romney s revolt was ever going to happen, it wasn t going to be in Florida. You d think Mitt s people would ve figured that one out, but there you go (millions are beginning to understand now why Romney performed so poorly in the 2012 election).Jason Carol s cameraman delivered a dim shot of the rally. If there was a church BBQ down the road, it would have drawn a bigger crowd than this.After this debacle last week, Rubio still found the gumption to go on national TV and more or less instruct his supporters to cast their vote for John Kasich in the Ohio primary. Never before in modern American history have we seen presidential candidates instructing their supporters to vote against them in order to derail the party frontrunner in the hopes of triggering a brokered Republican National Convention in July.In reality, a brokered convention means that even if Donald Trump wins the popular votes and the collects the most delegates in the GOP primaries   the Republican Party will call for a vote on the convention floor asking for all delegates to vote again, which in this case would mean that if the combined delegates of Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich exceeds that held by Donald Trump, then Trump would be dumped by his own party s establishment insiders at the convention  in favor of another yet to be determined party elite selection. Most likely this would be Mitt Romney s former running mate, House Speaker Paul Ryan, or one of the other three aforementioned candidates.Great on PaperBefore he was cast-off by the Tea Party purists in favor of Cruz, Rubio had positioned his brand as one of insurgency, but the crowd didn t buy it. So the brand was repositioned as a  safe  choice for voters.When the Rubio vs Trump m l e first started, I had said that this was the inevitable result of the Republican establishment who were,  going for the mathematical and demographically pragmatic option   which would be Marco Rubio, with Wisconsin s Scott Walker throwing early innings in the bull pen. Orthodox RNC thinking last spring believed that Rubio, with less than one term in Senate and no leadership experience, would somehow repeat the  Obama effect  of 2008, and finally usher their party into the 21st century. Things looked very different for Hillary last spring too, where she seemed invincible on the Democrat side as well as in national polling. On paper at least, it seems that Rubio would  tick all the right boxes  for the GOP elite presiding over a party in decline and disarray   young (44 years old, although you d put him at a decade his junior), and even more importantly, Latino, giving the GOP a shot at pulling in a crucial trilateral voter compliment: Hispanic-American, independents and moderate Democrats. On paper this all makes perfect sense, but running for President in the United States of America isn t simply a case of what looks logical on paper. Case and point: Bernie Sanders, Ben Carson and, of course, Donald Trump. It was a truly devastating moment for the Rubio campaign who had raised no less than $70 million so far as part of a desperate establishment bid to market the  Rubio brand . According to a chief strategist for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Rubio has been  more hyped than Crystal Pepsi,  in reference to Pepsi s 1992 marketing flop. Sen. Rubio has been more hyped than Crystal Pepsi, but he has flopped even worse,  said Weaver last week. Even a well-conceived, high-financed marketing campaign won t work if people don t want to buy the product. That s the Rubio campaign s problem . Behind the nice packaging, voters are discovering there is little substance. Not surprisingly, I don t really like Crystal Pepsi. No one does. But everyone remembers when Coca Cola tried to inflate New Coke, Cherry Coke, and finally Coke Zero, before it completely flopped. Millions were wasted in vain, and it seems that the only people who really benefited from this exercise in hype were the advertising agencies and the production companies who produced them   and also the media networks who sold the ad space to Coca Cola.The same could be said with Rubio, and of course with Jeb Bush and a few others, although Rubio may still live to run another day. Coke didn t give up on Zero. Zero eventually became a Hero (well, according to Coca Cola, anyway) after years and years of marketing capital was invested into that product  which no one was really interested in to begin with.Billionaire Boys ClubBillionaires love to gamble, especially in politics   and they gambled heavily   and lost, on Marco Rubio. One might question the establishment s efficacy in leaving an invisible Rubio in a primary race where he s taking votes away from a more promising challenger in Texas Senator Rafael Edward (Ted) Cruz. Ditto with Kasich.Maybe it s the egos, or maybe Trump is actually pulling the master strings. Either way, the establishment s anti-Trump obsession is tearing the Republican Party apart.Just when you thought it couldn t get any more like a true life black comedy, all three desperate GOP challengers found themselves courting the endorsement of election dropout and former Florida governor, Jeb Bush, on the Thursday before the CNN debate began.As sexy goes, this endorsement hardly registers outside of a few select country clubs. If it were an endorsement from 90 year old Barbara Bush then it might mean something.So poor was Jeb s showing in the primary contest   even after burning through over $100 million in campaign donations (he raised over $150 million) and received around 7% of the vote   it s difficult to see why anyone among Rubio, Cruz and Kasich would be offering a stump for Mr. Excitement, a  low energy  dynastic nonstarter.On balance, this endorsement would probably garner less votes than an endorsement from David Duke. Such is the bizarre and sideshow-like nature of this 2016 presidential election. A NEW AMERICAN CENTURY: Rubio uses Neocon s PNAC and  Israel-first old marketing slogan.Why the Elite Loved RubioLike his globalist colleague Kasich, and despite his evasive comments on the campaign trail, Rubio seems very committed to Wall Street and Bilderberg principles regarding corporate-brokered trade pacts like TPP, TTIP, GAT, and the WTO.On foreign policy, Rubio is a pro-war Republican, calling for regime change in Syria, and even made the incredible comment during one of the GOP s February debates that,  We didn t overthrow Gaddafi, the Libyan people did , having not realized that months of US air bombardment, as well as arming and working with Islamist militants on the ground is what toppled the Libyan state in 2011. Many of these same militants packed up and moved the roadshow to Syria in late 2011 and early 2012. The CIA were active and involved in the repatriation of fighters to Syria and the trafficking of weapons into Syria after the fall of Gaddafi. It would be shocking if Rubio wasn t aware of any of this, especially if he wants to be president of the United States.The other obvious, if not bizarre indicator that the globalists billionaire, military industrial class were firmly backing Rubio was hidden in plain sight. His campaign slogan was  A New American Century , and of course, the significance of this was completely lost on the mainstream media. It seemed that Rubio had stolen his campaign slogan from the likes of Donald Rumsfeld and John Bolton (and Jeb Bush, who also signed the PNAC pledge in 1998) whose neoconservative pro-war think tank, Project for A New American Century (PNAC) was arguably the architect of America s post-9/11 foreign policy. PNAC was also an extension of Israel s foreign policy too, which makes sense considering how aggressively Rubio advocates for Israeli interests.When you actually look at Rubio s record during his time in the Florida legislature, it does not paint a pretty picture at all.Without too much effort, any member of the media, including CNN s Don Lemon, Jake Tapper or Anderson Cooper, could find a substantial trail of dirt behind the young Senator   if only for the fact that Rubio s record seems to be off limits by the media and newspapers like the New York Times   all of whom are devoted to only running critical exposes on Donald Trump. Rubio s dubious track record of scandals and other pieces of corruption are well-known in his home state, but almost invisible nationally. Top of that list might be one David Rivera, a long-time political ally and close friend of Marco Rubio   who also happens to be under investigation by the FBI.That s only the beginning. One of the most telling scandals involved Rubio selling his home to a lobbyist, and getting way over the asking price. On The Issues reports: Rubio s personal finances were questioned because he made a $200,000 profit selling a house he owned to the mother of a chiropractor who was lobbying for a change in state insurance rules. Rubio had been a holdout, but removed a block on the measure shortly after the home sale and voted for it. Rubio was criticized for failing to disclose a home equity loan he received from US Century Bank, whose chairman, Sergio Pino, was a political supporter. The house had been appraised for $185,000, more than the purchase price just 37 days after he bought it. Rubio s staff said the value jumped because he d locked in a lower preconstruction price and made improvements. US Century Bank a large recipient of federal bank bailout money denied making a sweetheart deal. There are a number of other sketchy scandals linking Rubio to Florida s organized crime syndicates, ponzi schemes, including shady deals involving cash payouts and dodgy lobbyists, some of which can be read here. The mainstream media never challenged Rubio on any of these reports, so Rubio never had to defend against them.Then there s the business of Rubio s  sugar daddy , Jewish billionaire and Israeli luminary Norman Braman. Not only is Braman bank-rolling the Rubio political machine (in return for ?), but Brahman s  charity  foundation also employs Marco s wife Jeanette Rubio too. ON BOARD: Rubio with Israeli luminary Shimon Peres.  Brahman is also Rubio s entr e into the Israeli Lobby. It was Brahman who flew Marco and his family to Israel in 2010 to be inducted into the Israeli mind-set. This is also evident through Rubio s pro-Israeli rhetoric, where during one debate he proudly announced,  There can be NO negotiation between Israel and the Palestinians right now In another recent speech, Rubio took things a step further by insinuating that anyone who criticizes Israel is racist, insisting that, All of this anti-Israel action going on globally, it s anti-Semitism. He could easily be speaking as an Israeli envoy, speaking straight off of the lobby s talking script.That s just a snapshot of what sort of political animal Marco Rubio is   not unlike the rest of the pack, and perhaps a lot more shrewd, pushy and cunning than many others. You wouldn t expect anything less by anyone who believes that they deserve to be elected President of the United States having served less than one term in the US Senate at the age of 44.It s not certain yet whether or not Rubio will be able to retain his Florida US Senate seat after announcing he would be campaigning for president last year. Maybe a run for governor in Florida is in the cards.One thing is certain though, at his young age and with powerful backers like the Israeli Lobby   we have not seen the last of Marco Rubio. His talent and ability as a speaker and his potential for a broad-based appeal is undeniable and you can be certain he will remain a key tool for the establishment for many years to come.Just like Coke Zero, with enough marketing muscle and money injected into it, every brand can have a second life.Rubio will return.READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"March 16, 2016"
23410,"ELECTION FRAUD: If It Happened in Michigan, Will It Happen in Ohio?","21st Century Wire says On a recent episode of The Sunday Wire with Patrick Henningsen, guest Basil Valentine asked Patrick for his analysis on the Bernie Sanders vs. Hillary Clinton primary race, and what ensued was a poignant discussion about a deeper issue   voter and election fraud.PH: It s a tight race. Hillary has the edge on the super delegates, which is the most corrupt, un-democratic aspect of the Democratic Party. BV: I m not sure it s it s very un-democratic and corrupt, I agree. But I don t think it s the most corrupt. The most corrupt is the vote fraud. Basil cites a new report about the recent Michigan Presidential Primary, where its findings suggest that Bernie Sanders actually did better than the recorded vote share indicates.The author of the report, Richard Charnin, provides context not only for Michigan primary results but for Massachusetts results as well:This analysis indicates that Sanders did much better than his recorded vote in the Michigan primary. Sanders had 590,386 votes (49.8%) and Clinton 570,948 (48.3%). Sanders won in 73 of 83 MI counties with 56% of the vote. He won the preliminary exit poll by 52.1-45.9%, a 97% win probability. Clinton won urban counties Wayne and Oakland with approximately 55% of the vote.Clinton won the Massachusetts primary by just 1.4%, but she did well in urban areas. Sanders won hand-counted precincts by 57-40% in 68 Towns (32,360 votes, 2.7% of votes cast). Sanders also had 52.1% in the preliminary exit poll which he won by 52.1-45.7%. His win probability was also 97%.(See Charnin s full report and statistical analysis here, including a breakdown of voting machine totals.)Charnin explains there are three key indicators to track in determining whether election fraud has occurred:  cumulative vote shares, preliminary exit poll, absentee vote anomalies Of course, you will not hear much about election fraud from the media   their coverage focuses solely on the recorded vote at the end of the night, and the usual Poli-tricks and Propaganda  mess with voters  minds during their televised election coverage.Will we see these same election fraud indicators in the Florida, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina primaries?READ MORE 2016 NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Election Files",Middle-east,"March 15, 2016"

23412,HAWKISH DOVE: The Enigma of Donald Trump in Volatile Race to the White House,"Shawn Helton   21st Century WireGOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump is a populist candidate among a bevy of warhawk rivals  yet many still wonder how the real estate mogul has marched virtually unabated towards the 2016 Republican nomination.Undoubtedly, the stir Trump has caused this election season is already historic. Love him or hate him, the well-known businessman and reality TV star turned American political juggernaut is emerging as a surprising voice for US national interests in the face of an ever-increasing globalized world.Below we ll examine Trump s shocking rise in American politics, his strengths, his weaknesses and what he s up against   HAWKISH DOVE    Who s the real Donald Trump? (Photo illustration Shawn Helton of 21WIRE)The Curious Case of Donald Trump Back in 1993, brothers David and Tom Gardner founded The Motley Fool stockbroker consultancy, and at the time, it took the investment world by storm. Their mantra was simple: in business (as it is most everything else in life) timing is everything, and when a market or system becomes insular and stagnant, the conditions are ripe for a  rule breaker , and eventually, the rule breakers becomes the rule makers. This spirit of guerilla business also underpinned the Silicon Valley revolution in the 1990s and 2000s.Likewise, Donald Trump read the tea leaves and saw an opportunity in 2016.If you believe the United States is ruled by an elite establishment or is a country taken hold by statism, endless foreign intervention and crony corporatism, chances are you might be considering Donald Trump as your candidate of choice in the 2016 presidential election   and you wouldn t be alone. Similar sentiments are felt on the left-wing by supporters of Democratic Party outsider Bernie Sanders.Trump s outsider tag and anti-establishment veneer, is what seems to be resonating most among a broad base across America, as many believe that the country has been in a decline following two failed administrations in the White House under both Bush and Obama.This is the nature of populist campaigns and whether you like Trump or not, he s run one of the most effective presidential campaigns in American history, despite major backlash from the media and various political pressure groups attempting to stop his rise.The New PopulistsMuch like former Republican congressman Ron Paul in 2012, and to a lesser degree with Bernie Sanders, Trump has seemingly tapped into a cultural zeitgeist rarely seen in American politics as this year s preeminent populist choice.While Paul s staunch constitutional and libertarian beliefs propelled his popularity in 2012, it s Trump s cross-spectrum political thinking that s drawing supporters to his campaign marked by an ability to reach the average blue-collar worker, as well as successful entrepreneurs by bringing up issues concerning economic growth, immigration and global trade.To some critics however, Trump is not conservative enough, even though he s already unveiled one of the most comprehensive plans to uphold gun rights in modern history. The plan includes a proposal for nationwide concealed carry without placing a ban on certain types of guns or magazines   something which has become a hot button particularly for those on the left after a string of strange mass shooting events during much of 2015.On the other side of the political fence, many have criticized Trump s antiquated views on expanding torture techniques in the military, as well as his tough talk on internet security, privacy concerns and heavy stance on illegal immigration.The term  super-nationalistic  is being batted around to describe Trump s perspective, causing some to fear the unknown.Ironically, what has led to Trump s success has also hindered him and has arguably become a major weak point for the shrewd businessman.Trump s fiery rhetoric concerning certain issues facing America today, in some cases has worked against him, and has painted a target on him, opening the door for the media to spin anything he says, or doesn t say, or what others say about him.This is perhaps best exemplified with his tough talk on illegal immigration, along with his media counter attack against professional agitators and protesters at his events following several clashes at some of his rallies over the past few weeks.Unfortunately, his detractors and political rivals have already used these social triggers to attack the GOP frontrunner, as his Chicago rally was cancelled after erupting into a chaotic scene, leading to at least 5 arrests. Similarly, his St. Louis rally was also stormed, leading to 32 arrests, with much of the media joining in condemnation of the embattled businessman.While no one should condone the violence that results from Trump supporters clashing with outside political agitators at Trump s campaign events, critics insist that Trump has somehow escalated these volatile protests through his own incendiary language and for not using his powers of persuasion to  calm things down. Later on in this article, we ll take an even closer look at what s behind these seismic uprisings at Trump s campaign rallies.The Manhattan mogul s political story has only just begun and there are many things to consider concerning the embattled GOP frontrunner   WAR LIES    Former Secretary of State, Colin Powell and the Bush administration s findings revealed a highly coordinated disinformation campaign that led to over half a million deaths in the US-led invasion in Iraq in 2003. (Photo link foreignpolicyjournal)Alternative To War?Recently, Trump was pressed again on matters concerning the Middle East and his response has been surprisingly diplomatic with a non-interventionist platform. Trump s open condemnation of the Bush administration for the Iraq war and the Obama White House for the destruction of Libya, has resonated across the board for voters on both sides of the political spectrum. Trump has asserted that 2003 s invasion in Iraq and the blitzkrieg in Libya via NATO members in 2011, is further evidence of failed US foreign policy throughout the world.Doubling down, the GOP frontrunner Trump, has also refused to pick a side between Israel and Palestine   and in true form to his business pedigree, stating that he would rather attempt to broker a peace deal in the ages old conflict, rather than tow the party line.Calling Out  Bad  Global Trade   TRANS PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP    US leaders vote in favor of cloaked trade deal involving Asia pacific countries and America in 2015. Trump has been the only presidential candidate talking about the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal and its vast implications on the global economy.The Trans Pacific Partnership or TPP trade deal, is something we ve covered extensively at 21WIRE over the past two years, as international trade law for new trade treaties appear to be a way for private corporations to exempt themselves from the laws of sovereign nations under the guise of a so-called free-trade agreement.As global policy makers continue to merge with the interests of multinational or transnational corporations to achieve their goals, we could view the TTP or the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) as having zero national loyalty to any existing nation-state or its set of laws.These multi-national and transnational free trade deals have been vigorously opposed by Trump during many GOP debates this election cycle. Other critics of these deals have suggested they are being used as a way to gain a foothold on  property rights  in the future, in addition to having lasting implications on intellectual property.21WIRE previously outlined the role that the United States Trade  Representative has played in facilitating these deals between different industries: Understanding the power structure behind these draconian trade deals reveals the global chess play at work and the behind-the-scenes corporate merger s, under the watch of a biased government entity, the USTR. The USTR has been doing heavy lifting through its corporate connections with the likes of Haliburton (ESG and KBR) and Monsanto Corp, and  political insider  ties for a massive trade deal that will consolidate our future   all done outside of the democratic process.  This past week, Huffington Post published an article entitled  At Secretive Meeting, Tech CEOs And Top Republicans Commiserate, Plot To Stop Trump, : Billionaires, tech CEOs and top members of the Republican establishment flew to a private island resort off the coast of Georgia this weekend for the American Enterprise Institute s annual World Forum, according to sources familiar with the secretive gathering. The article goes on to say that the participants  couldn t help  discussing Trump   but he was not the sole purpose of the meeting. Here s some of the list of attendees as reported by HuffPo: Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google co-founder Larry Page, Napster creator and Facebook investor Sean Parker, and Tesla Motors and SpaceX honcho Elon Musk all attended. So did Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), political guru Karl Rove, House Speaker Paul Ryan, GOP Sens. Tom Cotton (Ark.), Cory Gardner (Colo.), Tim Scott (S.C.), Rob Portman (Ohio) and Ben Sasse (Neb.), who recently made news by saying he  cannot support Donald Trump. Recently, it was reported by Cleveland.com that  Ohio lost 112,500 jobs in 2015 resulting from the United States  trade deficit with countries that are part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute. Additionally, the EPI s findings state that an estimated 2 million jobs have already been lost due to the TPP and that half of those were in manufacturing industry.Above all else, Trump s non-interventionist outlook on the Middle East and his diplomatic approach to Israel and Palestine, as well as his strong position on free trade deals such as the TPP and TTIP, have all contributed to placing the outspoken candidate on the political chopping block.Such is the curious case of Donald J. Trump   AMERICAN PSYCHO?    Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney propelled Trump s campaign despite his desperate appeal to the public last week in a staged pre-debate speech. (Photo link cowgernation)Political Attack DogsThe anti-Trump coalition consists of the Republican Party establishment, the Leftwing and the mainstream media   and each of these factions are presently at war with Trump and his campaign.From the onset, you could see the horror in TV broadcasters eyes when confronted by Trump   a media mogul himself who knows how to conduct a symphony on the airwaves. In many respects, he s their worst nightmare   a politician who can outplay them in their media manipulation game.For the American Leftwing, he induces revulsion, and for good reason   his ability to tame the media has enabled him to discard the political correctness which governs US media discourse.The most sustained attack however, is coming from his own party. In the September of 2015, here at 21WIRE, we discussed how neoconservatives within the Republican Party were incensed when Trump first launched his presidential campaign bid over the summer. Flashing forward to now, it s even more apparent that the media and the dying GOP party elite have attempted to shanghai Trump and the public during his unexpected political rise.Since last summer, there s been a host of media pundits and Washington figureheads looking to take on Trump in a kinda of metaphorical Thunderdome, something which has routinely played out before millions of TV viewers   and one by one, each has become politically castrated, spayed or otherwise cast aside by the outspoken tycoon.You don t have to take my word for it, just ask Meghan Kelley, Lindsay Graham, Jeb Bush, as well as former FOX News favorite and PNAC (Project for a New American Century) waving neocon, Marco Rubio   a list, that may now include Mitt Romney, following his dirty, scripted propaganda speech meant to quell Trump s primary rise.It seems this year more than any other, the American public has peeled away at the politically fixed halls of FOX, CNN and others, as mainstream networks have deliberately attempted to derail Trump through a plethora of designer media attacks, timely  gotcha  questions, ambush-style interviews and scripted debate forums working in concert to keep the apparent GOP outsider off-balance throughout the entire presidential nomination process.  Astute observers of the GOP nomination process, might conclude that many media personalities, political insiders and beltway lobbyists are comfortable with America s long ago chartered cruise towards global ambiguity and perpetual stagnation, rather than to take a chance on new blood.In fact, The Grand Old Party pet-parade nearly flatlined last week after enlisting Bain Capital businessman and former Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney to unleash a scathing nationally televised assessment of Trump s presidential qualifications.Bain Capital, is an investment firm with a rich history of litigation concerning claims of disgruntled investors over profits, as well as a global company with big ties to military defense, aerospace and big agricultural giants like Monsanto.Romney s recent pre-GOP debate speech appeared to be a last-ditch effort directed by neoconservative strategists to silence Trump s campaign   but it led to a huge backlash and in the process, revealed the former governor s role as political spoiler (and thus damaged goods), as evidenced by his support of Bush-approved candidate John Kasich.Romney s speech, piggy-backed anti-Trump hashtag campaigns (#nevertrump and #stoptrump) that emerged in the weeks following an article by well-known neoconservative strategist, Peter Wehner on why he wouldn t support a Trump presidency.Here s a You Tube clip of Fox News contributor Judge Jeanine Pirro condemning Romney for awakening a sleeping giant  among the US electorate The Shape of ThingsMitt Romney and the billionaire boys club are out for blood.Trump is using big media to put out some  dangerous ideas    like the prospect for a peace deal between Israel and Palestine, and d tente with Russia, and also calling out the clear fraud of the Iraq War, as well as NATO s bombardment in Libya as Trump stated, Libya would be better off if we had left Gaddafi in power. If the politicians had gone to the beach instead, and did nothing, we d be better off in Libya and Iraq than we are today. Romney represents the financial and investment wing of the military industrial complex and an Israel first foreign policy. Along with John McCain, Romney is one of their  inside men  embedded inside the US political establishment.This is what Trump is really up against.It doesn t stop there, the dirty politricks continued this week as Rubio urged his supporters to vote for rival presidential candidate and Governor of Ohio John Kasich (a close Bush-family friend), with the Florida Senator stating, If you re a Republican primary voter in Ohio, and you don t want Donald Trump to be the nominee, John Kasich is your best bet. Incidentally, Jeb Bush met with  three non-Trump candidates  (Cruz, Rubio Kasich?) in Miami this week, a month after dropping out of the presidential race, due to his poor campaign results. The situation was described by the Wall Street Journal as the following: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who ended his 2016 candidacy last month after months of sparring with Mr. Trump, met with each of the three non-Trump candidates this week in Miami, though he hasn t offered direction on how to block Mr. Trump s path. On another interesting note, early in March, according to The Hill, CEO of FOX News, Roger Ailes, dropped his support for Rubio, if true, the move would signify this latest strategy to use Romney and Kasich as a way to undermine Trump s campaign. Here s the excerpt reported by The Hill: We re finished with Rubio,  Roger Ailes told one of the network s hosts recently, according to three unnamed sources.  We can t do the Rubio thing anymore. Flashing forward to this past week, Trump loyalist Roger Stone, wrote a revealing article entitled  Ted Cruz, A Bush By Another Name,  which detailed GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz s close relationship to the Bush family. Here s a  passage from Stone s recent piece at The Daily Caller: Neil Bush, the son of President George H. W. Bush, who defrauded U.S. taxpayers out of $1.5 billion dollars in the savings and loan scam, and later peddled influence for the Chinese government, (who plied him with Chinese prostitutes) has formally endorsed Senator Ted Cruz for president. You can t make this stuff up. The Bush-Cruz connection is clear. Ted was George W. s brain when he ran for president. A top policy adviser, Ted maneuvered for Solicitor General in Bush World but settled for a plum at the Federal Trade Commission. Ted s a Bush man with deep ties to the political and financial establishment.  Ted and wife Heidi brag about being the first  Bush marriage    they met as Bush staffers. SEE ALSO: Ted Cruz comes up  empty  on Obamacare as government continues debt scamAs the political claws are fully out now, the recent words of Pulitzer prize nominated journo, Jon Rappoport, comes to mind: A true populist leader would accept the fact that working through usual channels, to bring about stunning changes, is a loser. The enemy is entrenched. The enemy controls the landscape. The enemy controls the machinery. Where is the populist s strength coming from? Only one place: the people who are supporting him. So he has to go back to that well, over and over again. And now he can. While pondering Trump s rivals and populism, there s a deeper agenda concerning 2016 and beyond, something which was recently pointed out here at 21WIRE.In October of 2014, The Boston Globe published a stirring article rarely seen in the mainstream entitled  Vote all you want. The secret government won t change. The Globe piece covered Tufts University political scientist Michael J. Glennon s detailed perspective on the political process in America. The article included an in-depth discussion about Glennon s book  National Security and Double Government,  a book that gives the public an inside look into the collusion between neoconservative and neoliberal political strategy on the global stage   in particular, counterterrorism policies that are routinely followed by president after president.The idea of concealed policy between neoconservatives and neoliberals was further confirmed when Robert Kagan, a co-founder and co-author of The Project for the New American Century, recently endorsed Hillary Clinton for President.This was a big story, but it barely kept the media s attention span for longer than a week.Indeed, Kagan s endorsement should provide a window for people to see the so-called (neo) conservative players behind the scenes that might have helped Clinton escape the Benghazi scandal and might step in to rescue her from her ongoing national security related email case with the FBI.Clinton s exploits in Libya are well documented and her recent endorsement by neocon strategist Kagan, is just one more glaring example of political complicity, no matter who gets elected as the president of America, the foreign policy machinations are controlled by the same operators.Coincidentally or not, Kagan also appears to be linked to Romney s anti-trump plea to the public.In a catchy call to arms, a deeply biased political plea was published on the website called War On The Rocks. The piece featured an impassioned rant from those directly connected to the military industrial complex. In fact, many war party operatives, put their seal of approval on the message including Robert Kagan, as well as Former Homeland Security secretary, Michael Chertoff, (the Chertoff Group manufactured the TSA body scanners used in most major airports) as well as over hundred other political operatives.To those aware of these tactics, the War On The Rocks Trump hit-piece, read like a foreign policy business as usual dossier, with a heavy-handed characterization of mogul, while completely misrepresenting some of Washington s most notorious military interventions in recent memory.

(Photo link ulinet)Socially Engineered  Flash Mobs  Go Viral The political game changers are fully after the Trump campaign now, as the George Soros funded advocacy group MoveOn, played a large role in the Chicago University student organized shutdown at the Trump rally this past Friday, as well as a host of other splinter groups associated with Black Lives Matter (BLM) and supporters for Bernie Sanders.  BLACK BLOC   Black bloc provocateurs, have violently escalated protest movements since the 1980 s, including 2011 s Occupy Wall Street Movement. (Photo link examiner)The echoes are still felt from the Soros funded protests in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 and the Baltimore riots of 2015, something which immediately recalls the misguided machinations of The Occupy Movement (aka OWS) in 2011, an event that turned out to be a think-tank-spun divide and conquer stratagem designed to push naive participants into violent action.  CHICAGO CHAOS    Bernie Sanders supporters join Black Lives Matter linked groups to shutdown Trump rally. (Photo link twitter)Back in January, MoveOn publicly endorsed the Bernie Sanders campaign in what appeared to be a call to action for BLM associated groups seen backing Sanders. It s worth mentioning, that MoveOn, also supported the Obama campaign in 2008, according to the website, Sanders is the only other candidate to  threshold for an endorsement. From here on out, professional political agitator flash mobs, will be mobilized at future Trump campaign events, making it very difficult to run a normal campaign   taking away Trump s strength in numbers at his rallies. This was confirmed in Ohio recently, after a BLM activist and Sanders supporter, stormed the stage, shortly after Trump started speaking.In a Politico article entitled  Major donors consider funding Black Lives Matter,  we gain deeper insight into the political funding for BLM and the Soros linked Democratic Alliance: Major donors are usually not as radical or confrontational as activists most in touch with the pain of oppression,  said Steve Phillips, a Democracy Alliance member and significant contributor to Democratic candidates and causes. He donated to a St. Louis nonprofit group called the Organization for Black Struggle that helped organize 2014 Black Lives Matter-related protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the police killing of a black teenager named Michael Brown. And Phillips and his wife, Democracy Alliance board member Susan Sandler, are in discussions about funding other groups involved in the movement. It worth noting Soros, a long time contributor to Hillary Clinton, donated $2 million in PAC money in 2015 and January of 2016, Soros reportedly gave $8 million to  boost  Clinton s campaign. Soros also recently funded $15 million to Latino groups looking to stop Trump s rise towards a potential GOP nomination and beyond.Any bloodshed at the hands of   vigilante mobs  at Trump rallies, should be the responsibility of those who of have sought to politicize and fund this agenda from the very beginning.Look for these political engineers, to pit choreographed conservative and liberal groups against each other at Trump s rallies or events in the future   as all of these hostile uprisings are by design.During the Days of Rage in 1969, the FBI was said to have been  tracking specific members  of the Students for a Democratic Society. The SDS was heavily connected to 60 s political agitators turned domestic terrorists, The Weather Underground. Many concluded that the group s leader, Bill Ayers, was an interloper looking for new recruits that were easily manipulated into hostile action.This begs the question: Are government agencies still infiltrating political advocacy groups to push social change?The disruptions at Trump rallies are a form of modern class warfare, one that disguises its true intentions, eroding national sovereignty through a series of upheavals, while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the public s political perspective.Amazingly through it all, Trump s still been able to confound his opposition in the aftermath of a barrage of attacks, propelling his popularity even to even higher levels.The Ides of March primaries will be a good barometer to see what impact these chaotic clashes may have on Trump s campaign moving forward.It still remains to be seen if Trump s dynamic political vision for America will push the country further into authoritarianism or whether he can unite an embattled nation by restoring international relations throughout the world.But one thing is for sure   there s no doubt now that a systematic design is in place to unseat the GOP frontrunner and the public should question why READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"March 14, 2016"

23415,GOD SQUAD: Jury Finds Polygamous Mormon Towns Guilty of Discriminating Against ‘Non-Believers’,"Jamie Ross Courthouse News ServicePHOENIX   Two towns on the Arizona-Utah border dominated by members of a fundamentalist Mormon sect discriminated against residents who are not members of the church, a jury found Monday afternoon, granting $2.2 million in damages to six residents.The U.S. government sued Colorado City, Ariz., and Hildale, Utah in 2012, accusing the border towns of denying police protection, water and housing to nonmembers of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The church s leader, Warren Jeffs, is imprisoned in Texas for life plus 20 years for the sexual abuse of two young girls he had taken as his  spiritual wives.  INSULATED: Hilldale s religious enclave has triggered America s curiosity.The jury returned the verdict after nearly seven weeks of testimony, finding that the towns engaged in religious discrimination of nonmembers of the church in violation of the First Amendment s establishment clause. Another aspect of the verdict found that the towns  police force   the Colorado City Marshal s Office   violated the Fourth and 14th Amendments by subjecting nonmembers to unreasonable search and seizures and arrest without probable cause.The jury also found that Colorado City, Hildale and the cities  water utility, the Twin City Water Authority, violated the Fair Housing Act. Obviously, we should ve went a different way, but we respect the process,  said Blake Hamilton, an attorney for Hildale, after the verdict was announced. The case is far from over,  said Colorado City attorney Jeff Matura.  [The Justice Department] will have to propose what kind of injunctive relief they want. After deliberating for three days, the jury awarded six residents $2.2 million in damages for discrimination. The amount is not binding.During trial, the towns and the Justice Department entered into a $1.6 million settlement to cover damages suffered by the individuals, and possible civil penalties and fines.Christopher Jessop testified that church security ran his son off the road, and that the Marshal s Office helped cover it up.Nicknamed the  God Squad,  church security is said to monitor current and former FLDS members and keep an eye out for outside law enforcement.Jessop also testified that the Marshal s Office failed to investigate dozens of incidents of vandalism against his vehicle. The jury awarded him $1 million.Another $1 million will go to John Cook, a man repeatedly denied a water connection on a property to park his trailer.

Last night saw an unprecedented incident   where flash mobs from an opposing political party were successful in shutting down a presidential political rally.Up to this point, GOP front-runner Donald Trump was getting hit from every conceivable angle, but mostly from his own party. Last night things took a disturbing partisan turn Early Friday evening, thousands of Trump attendees were already people packed into an indoor arena at the University of Illinois in Chicago, when the event was suddenly canceled after hundreds of young Democrat student protesters took the venue floor, before clashing with Trump s Republican supporters only minutes before the candidate was due was to speak.

John Kasich, all condemning the disruptions at first, before laying blame on Trump, saying he alone was responsible for  the tone and tenor  at his rallies. Cruz took the media opportunity to say that Trump  affirmatively encourages violence. Expect More  Social Justice  MobsDemocrat Party website MoveOn.org posted that  hateful  Trump and his supporters have been  put on notice  and to expect flash mobs at all Trump political events in the future.Democrat Party activists initially tried to pressure civic authorities to prevent the event from happening with student activists claiming  fears for their safety  referring to African-American and Hispanic students fears of Trump supporters coming to the area. A petition was started on MoveOn.org and managed to get roughly 5,000 signatures. When authorities refused to cancel the event beforehand, Democrat Party activists then began organizing a large street agitation. Following a week-long social media and political community organizing campaign, young student Democrats and  social justice  activists converged on the venue last night, with signs and banners with anti-Trump slogans, including signs depicting the GOP candidate as Adolph Hitler, as well as other creative protest displays.Welp.

Hundreds of police, including officers on horseback acted as a barrier between the flash mobs and the venue. Law enforcement managed to re-route Trump supporters via other egress points which avoided a street confrontation.The Chicago Police Department arrested and detained four men and a woman at the event.READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"March 12, 2016"

23419,DARPA Spending $62 Million to Create Military Cyborgs,"21st Century Wire says Science fiction is now science fact.Watch a video of this report here: DARPA s program director for the project says the implant is seeking to open the channel between the human brain and modern electronics. A statement from DARPA said it will enable  data-transfer bandwidth between the human brain and the digital world, feeding digital auditory or visual information into the brain. The research agency claims the project is not intended for military purposes, yet experts believe it will have many military applications. While it could potentially restore senses to injured veterans, it could also be used to heighten the senses of perfectly healthy soldiers.Moreover, let us not forget that it is the Pentagon, the military s central command, whom controls the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency.Either way, DARPA is seeking to perfect the cyborg  an individual with both organic and mechanical body parts.If this device could be used to heighten the awareness of an individual s surroundings, could it also be manipulated to present a misleading perspective on what is happening around the implanted person?Could a soldier be manipulated into believing something was happening due to a certain message being transmitted to the implant, when in actual fact something entirely different was occurring in reality?Such devices present incredibly hard questions for accountability.However, Steven Pinker, a cognitive scientist from Harvard, is sceptical that the device could ever work: We have little to no idea how exactly the brain codes complex information My guess is that it s a waste of taxpayer dollars. Despite these concerns, DARPA is pressing ahead with the project.Do you think we are now a step closer to cyborg super soldiers, or just wasting $62 million?LEARN ALL ABOUT MILITARY SPENDING: 21WIRE Military Industrial Complex Files",Middle-east,"March 9, 2016"
23420,"‘Vote All You Want, The Secret Government Won’t Change.’","21st Century Wire says Those who pull the strings behind the curtain will be a lot harder to get rid of than the puppets which they control.Watch a video of this report here:Tufts University political scientist Michael J. Glennon gave a strong warning to the American people back in 2014 that you can vote all you want   but the Secret Government won t change.Glennon s argument is that a small clique of so-called national security experts, who might otherwise be called elites from the military industrial complex, are always influencing policy makers and over-emphasising security threats.Currently, the only candidate posing a real threat to these elites appears to be Donald Trump, who is claiming he wants  to get along with foreign countries , particularly Russia.But, what is the main reason why we cannot fix this problem? Glennon says it s  the pervasive political ignorance on the part of the American people .Here are the key questions and responses from the interview:What evidence exists for saying America has a double government?GLENNON: I was curious why a president such as Barack Obama would embrace the very same national security and counterterrorism policies that he campaigned eloquently against. Why would that president continue those same policies in case after case after case? Why would policy makers hand over the national-security keys to unelected officials?GLENNON: It hasn t been a conscious decision. Members of Congress are generalists and need to defer to experts within the national security realm, as elsewhere. They are particularly concerned about being caught out on a limb having made a wrong judgment about national security and tend, therefore, to defer to experts, who tend to exaggerate threats. The courts similarly tend to defer to the expertise of the network that defines national security policy.Isn t this just another way of saying that big bureaucracies are difficult to change?GLENNON: It s much more serious than that. These particular bureaucracies don t set truck widths or determine railroad freight rates. They make nerve-center security decisions that in a democracy can be irreversible, that can close down the marketplace of ideas, and can result in some very dire consequences.Couldn t Obama s national-security decisions just result from the difference in vantage point between being a campaigner and being the commander-in-chief, responsible for 320 million lives?GLENNON: There is an element of what you described. There is not only one explanation or one cause for the amazing continuity of American national security policy. But obviously there is something else going on when policy after policy after policy all continue virtually the same way that they were in the George W. Bush administration.This isn t how we re taught to think of the American political system.GLENNON: I think the American people are deluded to believe that the institutions that provide the public face actually set American national security policy. They believe that when they vote for a president or member of Congress or succeed in bringing a case before the courts, that policy is going to change. Now, there are many counter-examples in which these branches do affect policy. But the larger picture is still true policy by and large in the national security realm is made by the concealed institutions.Do we have any hope of fixing the problem?GLENNON: The ultimate problem is the pervasive political ignorance on the part of the American people. And indifference to the threat that is emerging from these concealed institutions. That is where the energy for reform has to come from: the American people. Not from government. Government is very much the problem here. The people have to take the bull by the horns. And that s a very difficult thing to do, because the ignorance is in many ways rational. There is very little profit to be had in learning about, and being active about, problems that you can t affect, policies that you can t change.Read Mark Glennon s 2014 epic Op Ed from the Boston Globe here GET THE FULL STORY ON THE 2016 ELECTION: 21st Century Wire Election Files",Middle-east,"March 9, 2016"
23421,"New Evidence Shows Foul Play, Cover-up by FBI and OSP in Shooting of LaVoy Finicum – DOJ Opens New Investigation"," 21st Century Wire says The mainstream media called it  case closed  after the FBI released its aerial footage of the ambush and shooting of LaVoy Finicum. Now, new evidence reveals that there was likely foul play and a misrepresentation by Federal and State authorities involved in the recent killing of rancher and protester LaVoy Finicum.As 21WIRE reported at the time (although ignored by the Oregonian and other mainstream media outlets) that without any audio track to synch with the FBI s aerial footage, it was impossible to really tell when shots were fired and if the official story was actually true. At the time, FBI Special Agent in Charge, Greg Bretzing, insisted that their footage provided an  honest and unfiltered view  of what happened. However, new evidence tells different story, and appears to demonstrate exactly how the official story was intentionally distorted by authorities   in order to cover-up what really happened that day.At yesterday s Deschutes County Sheriff s Office press conference, officials claimed that the state trooper tactical team members were  justified  in killing Finicum because the officers  feared for their lives.  However, authorities are now saying that the FBI agents involved are now being investigated for firing shots  and never reporting them.Mike Arnold, an attorney representing the Bundys explained on Tuesday,  The public deserved to have the video, with audio and sound, released immediately after the shooting. Now we know why it wasn t released: the public would have heard the shots that the government didn t want it to hear. The following presentation revealed at yesterday s press conference shows previously released FBI aerial footage synched together with a newly released cellphone video from passenger Shauna Cox recorded while inside Finicum s truck. Among other things, this new video proves that police fired first on the vehicle before anyone had even exited the vehicle. Watch: Most importantly, this new evidence reveals what happened immediately after that crash, and this could very well lead to criminal charges against the FBI agents and members of the Oregon State Police tactical units. According to today s Washington Post: Deschutes County Sheriff Shane Nelson said two bullets believed to be fired by FBI agents did not strike Finicum, who was hit by three rounds fired by state troopers. But Nelson announced at a news conference Tuesday that because the FBI agents  did not disclose their shots to investigators, nor did they disclose specific actions they took after the shooting,  his office and the Justice Department would both investigate. The new video, combined with a brand new disclosure by a team of local investigators points towards a conspiracy by agents and members of an  elite national unit  who appear to have lied about events at the police ambush and LaVoy Finicum s death   has now prompted a new investigation by the U.S. Justice Department, led by Inspector General Michael Horowitz.Finicum Shot in the BackAmong other details, newly released findings show that two state troopers shot Finicum three times in the back during the police ambush Jan. 26, 2016. An autopsy revealed that one of the bullets pierced Finicum s heart.Another shocking point of this investigation shows the complete incompetence and negligence on the part of officers positioned in front and behind LaVoy Finicum   creating a dangerous  cross-fire  situation, something which professional officers are taught to avoid, for obvious reasons.Mainstream Yellow JournalismThe mainstream media are still standing by their slanted terminology by describing the incident as a  traffic stop , presumably to downplay the premeditated operation by Federal and State authorities to intercept the two vehicles (both the Oregonian, the Washington Post and many other mainstream media outlets all used this skewed language at the time).Clearly, by any sober estimation of the incident, this was an elaborate, staged ambush involving dozens of vehicles and special tactical teams, and yet every mainstream media news outlet covered the incident with a pro-government bias where the victim was assumed guilty while the government was assumed innocent. Not surprisingly, this coverage quickly turned public opinion against Finicum and anyone else protesting similar issues. One example of the public hate that was generated against Finicum can be found in the comment section of many articles on the website Gawker where Gawker readers celebrated Finicum s death:Tens of thousands of similar hate comments can be found throughout many mainstream media articles and on social media. This fact proves how pivotal the mainstream media s skewed coverage was in turning sections of the population against the protesters in Oregon   despite the fact that Finicum s killing was an obvious ambush and a clear escalation of violence on the part of the government.Stay tuned for more updates at 21WIRE.SEE MORE OREGON STANDOFF NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Oregon Standoff Files",Middle-east,"March 9, 2016"

Over the last few weeks, tens of millions of dollars have been spent by US elites to try and derail Donald Trump s Republican primary juggernaut. Tonight s election results showed what a colossal waste of money this was.

Tonight s double win helps Trump extend his delegate lead over his party competitors   a strong sign heading into the next  Super Tuesday  contest March 15th.Ohio Gov. John Kasich had his strongest showing yet in Michigan effectively tying for second at 24% with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Interestingly, the GOP establishment favorite Florida Senator Marco Rubio hardly registered on the tote board, finishing with only 9% of the vote in Michigan, and only 4% in Mississippi. Other states holding contests today are Idaho and Hawaii, with results still pending.He may not have  won big  in terms of margins, but Democrat challenger Bernie Sanders shocked the media and the Democrat Party operatives by edging the establishment favorite Hillary Clinton, 49% to 48%, in the key working class battleground of Michigan   a state which everyone thought was a lock for the Clinton campaign.Hillary Clinton won comfortably in Mississippi with 82% of the vote. Her Mississippi win gives her a delegate lead with 685 pledged delegates for Clinton, and 477 for Sanders.Clinton has already secure an overwhelming lead, 461 -25, in the establishment s controversial  Super Delegate  sweepstakes   a parallel system created by party insiders in 1982 in order to hedge against outsider candidates.SEE MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"March 8, 2016"
23423,"Iraq Redux: US-led Sanctions Against Syria Are Hurting Real People, Helping Real Terrorists","Eva Bartlett RT OpEdgeThis month, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation interviewed Dr. Bouthaina Shaaban, Political and Media Advisor to Syria s President. The methods used to undermine Shaaban s message should come as no surprise.The interview was typical of the infrequent times corporate media has bothered to interview Dr. Shaaban: loaded lexicon, pre-priming the audience with false allegations about the Syrian government, repeatedly cutting-off the high-ranking guest, and a notably rude and condescending demeanor not afforded to guests who tow the NATO narrative on Syria.As with other top Syrian representatives, Shaaban is made out to be  non-credible  by corporate media pundits when they deign to interview her. They actively work to discredit Syrian officials while at the same time putting forth claims that Wahhabi terrorists are  rebels  and  Syrian representatives  and those warring on Syria are  concerned  about widespread suffering in the country. Zein Abudllah, 8, injured by shrapnel to his face in the December 12, 2015, triple terrorist bombing in al-Zahra a, Homs.   Eva BartlettSanctions: It is the Syrian People Who Are SufferingDr. Shaaban emphasized the Syrian realities at a meeting in her office in December.A crucially-important issue that media pundits ignore is that of the crippling sanctions on Syria. In terms of how to provide actual relief to the Syrian people, Dr. Shaaban stated: The first thing the West should do in this battle against terrorism is to lift the sanctions from the Syrian people. The sanctions are helping terrorists against the Syrian people, who are suffering doubly from the terrorists and from Western measures against the Syrian people. Stephen Gowans recently wrote about the US government s long-time plans to topple the Syrian government, sanctions being one part of the plot. Documents prepared by US Congress researchers as early as 2005 revealed that the US government was actively weighing regime change in Syria.  As an alternative to direct military intervention to topple the Syrian government, the United States chose to pressure Damascus through sanctions and support for the internal Syrian opposition. The advocacy website, End The Sanctions on Syria, notes:  Similar sanctions on Iraq in the 1990s were shown to have caused the deaths of more than half a million Iraqi children. The site went on to report that (as of May 2014),  701 of 1,921 Syrian health centres have been  completely gutted  by the terrorist attacks. Yet rehabilitation of these centres is retarded by the US-EU sanctions, which have already left  a deep mark on the healthcare system  including by blocking access to medicines, medical equipment, transport and communications. A May 27, 2015 article in The Lancet reports: The cost of basic food items has risen six-fold since 2010, although it varies regionally. With the exception of drugs for cancer and diabetes, Syria was 95 percent self-sufficient in terms of drug production before the war. This has virtually collapsed as have many hospitals and primary health-care centres.Economic sanctions have not removed the President:  only civilians are in the line of fire, attested to by the dire state of household and macro-economies. Sanctions are among the biggest causes of suffering for the people of Syria. Journalist who returned from #ISIS HQ tells RT how jihadists can be defeated https://t.co/EO1nr5UOGA pic.twitter.com/xq7Q2mgeKE  RT (@RT_com) November 22, 2015Western ContradictionsFrom 2011 to May 2014, Russia (as well as China) has used its veto four times against unjust UN Security Council draft Resolutions against Syria. In September 2015, upon request of the Syrian government, Russian fighter planes entered Syrian airspace, from the start doing what the US-led coalition had purported it would do: targeting terrorist hotbeds in Syria.Although continually vilified in Western media, Russia s requested and welcomed intervention in Syria complements their consistent anti-Western-intervention stance.In contrast, in the year and a half that the US-led coalition has been illegally violating Syrian skies, they ve done little to stop terrorists  movements and have repeatedly  accidentally dropped supplies to terrorist factions, while terrorists transit through hundreds of miles of open desert, thereby prolonging the otherwise-real fight against terrorism being waged by the Syrian army and allies.On Western diplomacy, Dr. Shaaban remarked: The contradictory statements coming from the West are puzzling, to say the least. Even when he (US Secretary of State John Kerry) said we are not seeking regime change, the US ambassador at the UN (Samantha Powers) said President Assad had to go. Then, Kerry gave a statement in the Security Council that he agreed with Russia that it is up to the Syrian people to decide their destiny and their government. Then President Obama comes and says, no, President Assad has to go. Indeed, aside from being immoral and criminal, the various statements and actions of Western leaders are borderline-schizophrenic.Obama has flip-flopped on his  Assad must go  position, his latest declaration alleging peace will not come  until Assad is out of power .Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter and Vice President Joe Biden have both flexed military muscles, saying America is ready to take  direct action on the ground  in Syria and ready for a military solution  in Syria.In contrast, on February 9, 2016, State Department Spokesperson, John Kirby, pledged: There s not going to be a military solution to this conflict.   It has to be solved politically. And more importantly, it has to be solved by Syrians. Kerry, in his most absurd Kerry-ism yet, is reiterating the  must go  line and waffling on about a  Plan B  and a  partition  of Syria.  Here is the difference between them and Russia. If you take the statements of Putin or Lavrov from the beginning of the crisis until now, you find them consistent, in line with each other. You find them coming from a stand against terrorism, that countries have sovereignties, and that it is the people of these countries who should decide the future of the country, with no foreign intervention. All of their stands are in line with international legitimacy and with UN resolutions.That s why the stand of the Russians, for us, is a noble stand. As Putin said, they are defending the national security of Russia and Syria, which is true. Turkey: Warring on Syria There s no dialogue between us and Turkey, none at all. Turkey continues to support terrorism in Syria. If you imagine a Syria without an 800 km border with Turkey, these terrorists could not have come to Syria. Turkey is an accomplice in this war on Syria.In Iraq, Turkey withdrew, because President Obama called Erdogan to withdraw from Iraq. This also shows that when the United States wants them to stop, they stop,  Shaaban said.A recent article on Consortium News emphasized precisely this point: The U.S. traditionally has held tremendous power over client states like Turkey and Saudi Arabia. So, an order from Washington is usually enough to get such governments to back down. Referencing Turkey s recent shelling of Azaz in Aleppo, it noted: Turkey s attacks also are aimed at preventing the Syrian government from sealing the Turkish border where the Islamic State and other jihadist groups have smuggled across fighters, weapons and other supplies into Syria   as well as oil from Syria into Turkey. According to Dr. Shaaban,  Western countries keep silent about Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, because these are the three countries which are financing, arming and facilitating terrorism into our country.  Syrian Ambassador to the United Nations, Dr. Bashar al-Ja afari (image from Syrianews.cc) Our people are the victims of this terrorism On December 13, the day I arrived in Syria, terrorists rained more mortars than usual on Damascus. I asked Dr. Shaaban the pointedly rhetorical question of whether Western leaders condemned this or other terrorist acts in Syria. Nobody speaks about mortars hitting our cities, our civilians. These missiles are hitting our schools, our hospitals, and people on the street. They are not targeting the army.Many countries have the technology which could detect these mortars and save the lives of civilians. But with the sanctions being imposed on Syria, nobody will give us this technology. She cited the December 17, 2015 passing of UNSC Resolution #2253, on halting the financing and support of terrorism, emphasizing,  There are so many resolutions before that: 2170, 2178, 2199. The latest, a 28-page resolution,  covers asset freeze, travel ban, arms embargo and listing criteria for ISIL, Al-Qaida and associated individuals, groups, undertaking and entities,  the UN s press release noted. However, given that the US itself continues to arm terrorists, it is likely this last resolution will not have the desired effect of truly stopping terrorism in Syria. Our people are the victims of this terrorism. Syria is a secular country, so many ethnicities and religions have lived peacefully together for thousands of years. Syria is an example of tolerance, of love,  Dr. Shaaban observed, before imploring Western people  to understand that in Syria, mothers, children, fathers, grandchildren  people, like any people in the world, would like to live in peace and security and are suffering from terrorism. Syria refuses to surrenderJust before leaving Syria last December, I was invited to the Joy Choir s Christmas concert. The day prior, President al-Assad and First Lady Asma al-Assad visited the practising choir. Photos and videos of the event evidence the choir s delight at the drop-in. The following evening, the church was so packed that lines of hopeful attendees spilled onto the sidewalk. I mentioned this to Dr. Shaaban. I saw the photos. This is something that you cannot fabricate. You can see from their faces how happy they were,  Shaaban replied. I m very proud of our people. Because President Assad went there the night before, you could expect that some people would be afraid to go, because it might be targeted by the terrorists. Yet the church was crowded. The people were determined to be there, whether it got targeted or not. The Notre Dame de Damas Church is indeed in close proximity to the terrorist-occupied area of Jobar, which regularly fire mortars, hell-cannons, and rockets on Damascus. This is the merit of the Syrian people. They do not fear death. The world wants to destroy us, and the Syrian people are saying  no  in every kind of way. When there is a terrorist missile, for example on Bab Touma, immediately after, people are out on the streets. We refuse to die. We refuse to surrender,  Shaaban emphasized.Indeed, on my December visit to various parts of Homs, including the Old City, there was evidence of the pulse of life: new shops and stalls opened; homes and restaurants rehabilitated.A more recent example of this resilience involves the terror-bombed and ravaged neighborhood of al-Zahra a in Homs, which I also visited in December. Tragically, it has been hit by terrorists  car and suicide bombings three more times since the December 12th triple-blast bombings. After one of the more recent terror attacks, Dr. Shaaban noted on her Facebook page (translated from Arabic): My brothers live in this neighborhood and when I called them they told me that the streets have been cleaned and shops opened and people continued their work. This is the secret to victory in Syria. READ MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Syria Files",Middle-east,"March 7, 2016"

23425,UN Physically Removes Independent Media From NYC HQ For Exposing Institutional Corruption,"21st Century Wire says For years, the United Nations seems to have been embroiled in an endless string of scandals and cover-ups, and yet rarely, if ever, has anyone ever actually been held to account. This has led a number of pundits to accuse the institution of being  above the law  and riddled with institutional corruption.This latest story only reaffirms these accusations Independent journalist Matthew Russell Lee (photo, left) founded Bronx-based Inner City Press in 2005 and received official press accreditation to cover the United Nations in New York City. He was the first-ever independent, non-affiliated blogger to be given access to the UN s inner sanctum. Since then Inner City Press has broken stories on a number of controversial stories: peacekeeper rapes in Africa, UN cholera in Haiti, war crimes in Sri Lanka and Burundi, the Sudans, SEMG and Yemen (see a leaked letter here), as well as corruption within UN Headquarters (cocaine shipments through its mail room and the current bribery scandals).Apparently, it was all too much for diplomatic luminaries at the UN. Last month, Lee was forcibly ejected from the UN headquarters.The DC-based Government Accountability Project, which defends UN and other whistleblowers, believes that the ouster of Inner City Press from the UN s press office is  retaliatory in response to independent, critical journalism. UN Restricts of Free PressOn the afternoon of February 19th, Inner City Press questioned UN inaction in South Sudan and Burundi and financial irregularities, and was handed a letter from Ban Ki-moon s Under Secretary General for Public Information Cristina Gallach ordering Inner City Press to surrender its Resident Correspondent accreditation of eight years and be removed from the UN by 5 pm. In a letter that gave Inner City Press only two hours notice, Gallach told Inner City Press to surrender the key to its long-time shared office. Read the UN letter here. Later, while Inner City Press was writing up a UN Security Council meeting on Syria that went into the evening, a total of eight UN Security guards under Deputy Chief Michael McNulty tore off Inner City Press  UN ID badge and grabbed Inner City Press  laptop and camera, before throwing them on the sidewalk on First Avenue as well as physically throwing journalist Matthew Lee on the street in freezing weather, without a coat. Audio here; video as UN Security turns off Inner City Press  Periscope livestream here:  Ban Ki-moon, whose  victory tour  of blood-soaked northern Sri Lanka Inner City Press covered and was never forgiven for by Ban s UN, was the target of a demonstration in Jaffa for the ouster of Inner City Press.

The airstrikes, usually delivered on several targets during each combat flight, are  accurate and efficient,  the analysis reportedly says.The US-led counterterrorist coalition, deploying about 180 warplanes against Islamic State (IS, former ISIS/ISIL), strikes only about 20 targets a day. The paper says the number of Russian fighter jets on the ground is  clearly inferior in number  to NATO s group, but the higher frequency of the Russian air raids makes them more effective.The US-led counterterrorist coalition has been operating in Iraq and Syria for over a year, while Russia launched its offensive on terrorist groups on September 30, 2015.The NATO report points out that the Russian task force obtains actual intelligence about important terrorist targets from special forces and spies on the ground, as well as Syrian Air Force aerial reconnaissance.The Russian Air Force has turned the Syrian battlefield into a test ground for advanced military technologies, such as deploying ultra-modern Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets to Syria s Khmeimim airbase. The plane is believed by many experts to be superior to most existing warplanes, the report claims.The NATO report acknowledged that it is the highly professional performance of the Russian task force in Syria that made the greatest contribution in putting an end to the cruel  display of power  practiced by terrorists in Syria for years.The FOCUS media outlet stressed the document never mentions any civilian casualties caused by Russian airstrikes Continue this story at RT READ MORE NATO NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire NATO Files",Middle-east,"March 6, 2016"

The neocon political faction that has dominated the Republican Party during recent history believes there is little to be gained from cooperation in politics, and prefers confrontation and domination instead; as they amply demonstrated with their 2003 Iraq War.For Donald Trump to be specifically saying that he wants to  get along with Russia  is unparalleled, as Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, said that Russia was without question our number one geopolitical foe .A world with an American President that wants  to get along  might certainly look a lot different to today s. Yet, as we are seeing, with the myriad of attacks against Trump, certain political and military industrial complex elite interests are not happy about the concept.Of course, we must remember that this is still just that   a concept. However good of a concept it is, Trump may very well not deliver this goal.Still, it certainly is a very different, and somewhat sweeter, change to the tune of American foreign policy rhetoric than we are used to hearing.Do you believe Trump has the right foreign policy stance, and will he implement it?GET THE FULL STORY ON ELECTION 2016: 21st Century Wire Election Files",Middle-east,"March 4, 2016"
23429,BATTLE OVER PRIVACY: Why the FBI’s Case Against Apple is Falling Apart,"Shawn Helton 21st Century WireThis week a House Judiciary Committee began overseeing details of a US Federal Court case between tech company Apple and the FBI.On February 16th, Apple CEO Tim Cook publicly rejected a court order to decrypt an iPhone said to be connected to the San Bernardino mass-shooting case from December of 2015.The House Judiciary Committee listened to the controversial case between tech titan Apple and the FBI a day after Magistrate Judge James Orenstein of New York, struck down a federal court order pressuring Apple to help access encrypted data in a separate case involving illegal drug trafficking.The landmark decision made by Judge Orenstein stated that the All Writs Act of 1789 (also used as the FBI s main argument in the Apple/San Bernardino case) does not permit a court to order companies to pull encrypted data off a customer s phone or tablet,  according to a recent article from The Washington Post.The Post continued by discussing Orenstein s lengthy argument against the FBI s order against Apple in the drug related case: In a 50-page opinion disdainful of the government s arguments, Orenstein found that the All Writs Act does not apply in instances where Congress had the opportunity but failed to create an authority for the government to get the type of help it was seeking, such as having firms ensure they have a way to obtain data from encrypted phones. In addition, The Post outlined some of the social engineering aspects involved in the lead up to the FBI drug case overseen by Judge Orenstein, a case which has arguably been a part of an overarching back drop concerning the larger San Bernardino case: The Brooklyn case began last fall when Orenstein, one of a handful of magistrates across the country who are activists in the surveillance debate, received the government s application to issue an order to Apple. While Apple has previously helped the federal government with some 70 phone cases since 2008, Judge Orenstein examined several problems with the FBI s use of the All Writs Act: In an Oct. 9 ruling, Orenstein identified what he thought was a problem with the government s argument. Though prosecutors cited a 1985 decision that found that the All Writs Act is a source of authority to issue writs  not otherwise covered by statute,  he said they failed to cite another part of the decision that found that the act does not authorize the issuance of  ad hoc writs whenever compliance with statutory procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate. The new ruling in the FBI drug case will likely have a heavy impact on the eventual ruling in the San Bernardino/Apple court order, as it directly questions the heart of the government s argument to gain easier access to encrypted consumer data.It s also interesting to note, that it was the FBI who put themselves in this position regarding the San Bernardino phone as they reportedly ordered the password to be reset via iCloud shortly after the apparent mass shooting.You have to wonder why the agency would have ordered a new password almost immediately following the highly dramatic scene in San Bernardino   INVENTIONS OF REALITY?    Is this latest  privacy crisis  a manufactured drama or a legitimate battle for those in the tech industry? (Photo illustration 21WIRE)What s interesting here, is that ABC news reported on December 3rd, a day after the apparent shooting,  Sources say mobile phones, hard drives, virtually anything with digital memory that was associated with the alleged shooters   Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik   was smashed. Adding to that, we ve mentioned a number of times here at 21WIRE, that none of the eyewitness testimony mentioned seeing a female shooter at the scene of the Inland Regional Center in the aftermath of the San Bernardino shooting.A Right to PrivacyIn our previous article detailing the ongoing encryption saga between Apple and the FBI, we stated that there are no guarantees in the security world, especially if a digital master-key were to be created, as this would potentially make it easier for invaders (either the government, or various hackers) mining for data moving forward into the future.In a recent Guardian article, some of those involved in the technology and security sector offered their thoughts regarding the government s continued encroachment on individual privacy:Dan Kaminsky, the security expert who made his name with the discovery that one of the most basic parts of the internet, the domain name system, was vulnerable to fraud   disagrees:  Feds want final authority on engineering decisions, and their interests don t even align with fighting the vast bulk of real-world crime. Kaminsky further explained why Apple s security measures already help law enforcement, If my iPhone is stolen, my emails stay unread, my photos stay unviewed, and I don t need to notify anyone that the secrets they entrusted me with are going to show up on the internet tomorrow. Continuing, The Guardian interviewed former FBI agent Michael German, currently at judicial think-tank the Brennan Center. The following is a portion of that interview: After 9/11, you had this concept of total information awareness. The intelligence community was very enamoured of the idea that all information was available. Much like the NSA, they wanted to see it all, collect it all, and analyse it all. Additionally, there are many who believe weaker encryption may pose an even bigger security risk globally.In many ways, it appears as though federal agencies are seemingly searching for the right crisis to push public opinion in favor of the state when it comes to security.This is at the core of the perpetual privacy and security battle post 9/11   TARGETING PRIVACY    FBI Director James Comey speaking at the Brookings Institution in October of 2014 about Going Dark. (Photo link brookings)Shining a Light on the FBI  Going Dark Last September, The Washington Post published an article entitled, Obama faces growing momentum to support widespread encryption,   and within its contents, perhaps the true nature of the security/privacy issue was laid bare (hat tip saperetic): Privately, law enforcement officials have acknowledged that prospects for congressional action this year are remote. Although  the legislative environment is very hostile today,  the intelligence community s top lawyer, Robert S. Litt, said to colleagues in an August e-mail, which was obtained by The Post,  it could turn in the event of a terrorist attack or criminal event where strong encryption can be shown to have hindered law enforcement. There is value, he said, in  keeping our options open for such a situation. Interestingly, in October of 2014, FBI Director James B. Comey, explained while speaking at the Brookings Institution he was  focused on trying to get the law changed  so that tech companies would have to comply with law enforcement to unlock data on various devices.Continuing, he outlined the current security agenda concerning the FBI,  We have the legal authority to intercept and access communications and information pursuant to a court order, but we often lack the technical ability to do that. The Brookings speech from 2014, appeared in stark contrast with a recent emotionally driven op-ed Comey wrote for Lawfare entitled  We Could Not Look the Survivors in the Eye if We Did Not Follow this Lead. Here s a passage from that piece, that clearly displays the conflicting message of the FBI director: We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist s passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly. That s it. We don t want to break anyone s encryption or set a master key loose on the land. The Guardian refers to this as a  two-pronged approach  on the public s senses   as one tone from the FBI comes across as caring and the other seems more focused on the greater, nationalistic implications of encryption.Think good cop/bad cop hovering over you in an interrogation room and you d be getting very warm.This is the kind of psychological drama that has prompted some in media to think that the law enforcement agency has been exploiting the public in the wake of tragedy, in order to increase security measures.This is absolutely something to watch.So, what are we to make of the FBI s claims of going dark in the digital age?It has long since been claimed that intelligence agencies fear going dark in the age of high-tech gadgetry. This idea is vastly overblown and not rooted in reality, especially when you consider the many revelations concerning NSA spying, collection of bulk metadata and other tracking programs such as the IMSI catcher, otherwise known as Stingray (Stingray acts as cell tower locking onto all devices in a certain area) intercepts phone calls, texts, as well as your location.The very notion that law enforcement will somehow be condemned eternally to outdated methods to catch criminals in the future   is patently absurd.Furthermore, the concept and presentation of the FBI s  going dark  scenario is nothing more than a talking point used to increase a police state apparatus within the United States.Don t PanicOn February 1st, a group of experts published report regarding the current status of law enforcement and their ability to keep up with the demands of crime solving in the world today. The lengthy report entitled  Don t Panic was compiled by The Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. Here s a passage below examining the FBI s catchy mantra,  Going Dark :The U.S. intelligence and law enforcement communities view this trend with varying degrees of alarm, alleging that their interception capabilities are  going dark.  As they describe it, companies are increasingly adopting technological architectures that inhibit the government s ability to obtain access to communications, even in circumstances that satisfy the Fourth Amendment s warrant requirements. Encryption is the hallmark of these architectures. Government officials are concerned because, without access to communications, they fear they may not be able to prevent terrorist attacks and investigate and prosecute criminal activity. Their solution is to force companies to maintain access to user communications and data, and provide that access to law enforcement on demand, pursuant to the applicable legal process. However, the private sector has resisted. Critics fear that architectures geared to guarantee such access would compromise the security and privacy of users around the world, while also hurting the economic viability of U.S. companies. They also dispute the degree to which the proposed solutions would truly prevent terrorists and criminals from communicating in mediums resistant to surveillance.While the report states that encryption is a difficult issue for law enforcement, all sorts of digital data is unencrypted and therefore can be accessed via a search warrant if there is cause   not to mention the spying capabilities of a plethora of smart devices also available for review.Below is FBI Director (former Senior Vice President at Lockheed Martin) discussing the idea that the government is Going Dark In an article entitled  Here s Why the FBI Went After Apple When It Did,  Fortune magazine revealed that on February 9th, DOJ head Loretta Lynch requested  an extra $38 million to help the FBI development workarounds on data encryption, bringing the total budget of what it calls  project Going Dark  to $69 million. Will the FBI continue to develop  encryption workarounds  in the event that they lose their battle with Apple over the San Bernardino case?In Summary Regardless of how you shape the court battle between Apple and the FBI, this is about the government wanting a more direct route into personal devices moving ahead.For Apple, this is a very important issue as a dip in consumer confidence, could be a crushing blow to the tech company s overall brand.It s important to remember anomaly ridden events such as the San Bernardino shooting and the suspicious events in Garland, Texas, of last year, in addition to other inconvenient truths concerning the government s role in manufacturing its own terror plots   which have ironically prompted calls for greater national security, while continuing to appropriate large funds to federal agencies.You have to wonder, has the FBI s case against Apple fallen apart?READ MORE ENCRYPTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Encryption Files",Middle-east,"March 3, 2016"

Delta Force is 200-men strong in Iraq, and will be carrying out raids on targets, recovering hostages, eliminating terrorist commanders and gathering intelligence from enemy locations.Carter also said: This force will also be in a position to conduct unilateral operations in Syria. What Carter is really saying is that Delta Force may be used illegally in Syria, as they have no mandate from the sovereign Syrian government, or the UN for that matter, to conduct any operations at all on Syrian territory.Some might even say this is an American threat to invade Syria.Russian actions, on the other hand, are absolutely legal under international law, as they are fully sanctioned by the Syrian government.Earlier this week we learned that the Russian special forces unit Spetznaz was infiltrating ISIS with undercover operatives, which enabled airstrikes to hit within just three meters of their targets.Do you think Delta Force will have a real effect on the fight against ISIS?GET THE FULL STORY ON THE SYRIAN CRISIS: 21st Century Wire Syria Files",Middle-east,"March 3, 2016"

23435,Blood Sport: GOP Presidential Race Takes Another Brutal Turn As ‘Party Favorites’ Tear Into Trump,"Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireAs Baron Rothschild famously said back in the late 18th century,  When there s blood in the streets, it s time to buy property.  Too bad then that Donald Trump has to divest all of his holdings and put them in the hands of a blind trust. On the scale of ugly, last night s debate was a moon shot even by this election s sinking standards.Both Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz began their two hour-long sustained attack on the man in the middle, Donald Trump   relentlessly hitting the front-runner with every conceivable  gotcha  factoid and political angle. Trump hit back at Cruz calling him  a liar  and at Rubio calling the Florida Senator  choke artist  in reference to his meltdown at the hands of Chris Christie during the last televised debate. WAR: GOP rival Marco Rubio tearing into Donald Trump on an endless range of issues and supposed scandals.Clearly, CNN was also part of this coordinated attack, as they echoed Wall Street luminary and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney, going after Trump about publicly releasing his tax returns. Trump then hit back saying that he s being audited by the IRS and can t release his returns in the middle of an audit (which is actually true), and CNN, along with Cruz, kept hammering the issue straight into the post-debate media opportunity where CNN ing nue Chris Cuomo tried (and failed) to channel his inner Tim Russert as he continued the Trump tax probe.It didn t end there. Subsequent gang stalking by Rubio and Cruz were powered by the New York Times (who s adopted a overwhelmingly anti-Trump editorial stance early on), including accusations of fraud over the Trump University civil court case, Trump using Polish building labor in 1980 (the same year that Rubio and Cruz were beginning second grade), and accusations of hypocrisy over Trump s use of used H-2B Visa applications to import seasonal labor to build in south Florida (that one turned out to be  nothing burger  though. Trump, a seasoned litigator, didn t seemed too worried about the Trump University case, intimating that  the lawyers are taking care of that , and the Polish builder scandal (come on guys, who doesn t like Polish builders?) happened 36 years ago.Forget about airs and graces. This was a vicious battle   a historic new low for American politics. The fact Trump survived the beating was something in itself. If he does make it through this storm, then both Cruz and Rubio will have done The Donald a huge favor   having vetted and exorcised all of his scandals early on during the primary stage, and leaving Hillary and the media with little besides bone to chew on come August.When today s morning press came out, exactly as they have throughout this election, all of the mainstream media channels, newspapers and magazine loudly declared Trump s  debate defeat , and trumpeted Rubio  aggressiveness . Liberal establishment stalwart The Atlantic declared,  Trump s Terrible night , while NBC News ran with the headline that  Rubio and Cruz Hammer Trump , followed by the Washington Post trumpeting,  Rubio Won Debate, Put Trump on the Defensive. Other wishful pundits weighed in, like media mogul Glenn Beck (who is openly backing Ted Cruz and warning his audiences of an end times Armageddon if America doesn t elect a  true Christian Conservative  in November). Beck was ecstatic after Rubio s debate performance, especially after this week when Trump gatecrashed a Nevada event where Beck was stumping for Cruz.Rubio is killing it.#gopdebate  Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) February 26, 2016This morning, Rubio drew additional fire from the Trump CENTCOM after Rubio claimed that Donald Trump had received $200 million from his father, and said if not for his father s  inheritance , Trump would be  selling watches in Manhattan. This morning Rubio appeared at an outdoor media event where he tore into Trump, calling him a  con artist  and went on the pick apart Trump s spelling mistakes on Twitter. At this point, you just got the feeling that Rubio has ventured into a new area of media warfare outside of his own sanitized political wheelhouse. As the old saying goes: never wrestle with a pig.In the end, it was Trump who stole the wind from Rubio s sails, when early the following morning he appeared on national TV next to firebrand GOP candidate, Chris Christie, garnering a power midstream endorsement from the popular New Jersey governor. RENT-A-CROWD? Critics have pointed out that Rubio s crowds appear as props for the camera, as seen at this morning s Rubio rally in Texas.Crowds For Hire?With so many people disengaged from mainstream politics and from major broadcast media, politicians are said to be turning to PR agencies and  rent-a-crowd  services in order to fill out their camera frames and look more appealing to audiences. More than any other previous presidential election cycle, this 2016 race has seen more accusations of this   leveled mainly at GOP candidates like Jeb Bush   but also towards Marco Rubio. At this morning s media event, Rubio s team had hand-picked dozens of youths and immaculately dressed made up crowds   carefully assembled in rows behind and directly below Rubio. Interestingly, the teen models and the gangsters do not cheer with the core crowd positioned between the cameras and Rubio   they simply smile, and many of these people are wearing sunglasses   on an overcast morning in Texas. Even hip hop gangster-looking students wearing color-coordinated red hoodies   many of whom are even too young to vote, appear disinterested, as if they are being paid $40 to stand in a row in the camera frame.If this is any indication of Rubio s  New American Century , then it s certainly cause for worry. The fact that Rubio stole his campaign slogan from Donald Rumsfeld and John Bolton s neoconservative pro-war think tank, Project for A New American Century (PNAC) is interesting, and the fact the media have not commented yet on this is highly suspect.Ironically, it was the brash hawk Donald Trump who took the high ground on the issue of the Middle East. When asked about his commitment to Israel, Trump pointed out that he would not take sides beforehand when brokering any peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and even stated that if he could negotiate a peace deal between the perennial warring neighbors that,  It would be my greatest achievement as US president.  Who can really argue with that? Well, hermanos Cubanos did. Cruz and Rubio were furious at this point, and the reason for this has to be that both of them have received mucho dinero from the Israeli Lobby to maintain a categorically anti-Palestinian stance. Cruz and Rubio adopted a very ugly tone during this exchange, both telegraphing their commitment to the decrepit status quo   meaning that there would be no peace in the Middle East on their watch. Once again, Cruz and Rubio are completely out of touch with what voters really want.Almost one year ago I said on the SUNDAY WIRE SHOW that the Republican establishment would be looking to hedge its approach to returning to the White House more than they have in past elections   this time going for the mathematical and demographically pragmatic option   which would be Marco Rubio, with Wisconsin s Scott Walker throwing early innings in the bull pen. Orthodox RNC thinking last spring believed that with Rubio, with less than one term in Senate and no leadership experience, could somehow repeat the  Obama effect  of 2008 and finally usher their party into the 21st century. Things looked very different for Hillary last spring too, where she seemed invincible on the Democrat side as well as in national polling. On paper at least, it seems that Rubio would  tick all the right boxes  for the GOP elite who are presiding over a party in decline and disarray   he s young (44 years old, although you d punt him at a decade his junior), and even more importantly he s Latino, which gives the GOP a shot a pulling in a crucial trilateral voter compliment: Hispanic-American, independents and moderate Democrats. On paper this all makes perfect sense, but running for President in the United States of America isn t simply a case of what looks logical on paper. Case and point: Bernie Sanders, Ben Carson and, of course, Donald Trump.CurtainsIf Cruz loses his home state Texas GOP primary on March 1st, then it s lights out for the Cruz campaign. Right now Cruz and Trump are in a dead heat, nearly tied in the pre-polling, with Cruz a few points ahead. Ditto for Rubio in his home state Florida s GOP primary on March 15th. Currently, Trump is burying Rubio by an average of 15+ points in every poll for Florida. Birther issues aside, this has always been the knock against both Rafael Edward  Ted  Cruz (photo, left) and Marco Rubio: just like Barack Obama, they are too young and with no real experience governing, and like Obama, destined to become party functionaries.Trump supporters will often point out that while their man was building skyscrapers in Manhattan, both Cruz and Rubio were still scraping their knees playing dodge ball in junior high. Putting this into perspective, it s hard to take a junior politician seriously when they talk about  restoring America . Like him or hate him, Trump has a long list of achievements and powerful relationships, and has actually created jobs. As much as politicians tell us that their successive administrations have conjured  job creation , the truth is that Americans no longer believe this lie, and millions now see Donald J. Trump as the antidote to that institutional fib. If you polled Americans today and asked them: would you rather live on government assistance or build your own company and be independently wealthy (?), it s fairly certain that the overwhelming majority of Americans would choose the latter   even if it meant risking everything. Trump understands this dynamic better than any other candidate because for him, it s not a theoretical proposition. In essence this is the American Dream, and therein lies the disconnect for both career politicians Rubio and Cruz, and perhaps for Hillary Clinton too, should she face-off against Trump later on.Despite the mainstream media insistence that Marco Rubio  won  Thursday night s debate, and  Ted Cruz looked  strong , it s fairly clear that both candidates are now relying on negative attacks and cruel swipes, in effect, trying to out-Trump The Donald. If that s their main strategic directive   and mind you we haven t even reached super Tuesday yet   then it s fair to say we are looking at the final desperate lunges of two highly over-inflated political marketing exercises. Their double team might have impressed a few media gatekeepers, but in the end it didn t make the Cuban pair look presidential. At this stage of the race, looking presidential is important, but when you re desperately playing catch-up you simply can t afford to look presidential, according to Rubio and Cruz anyway. Just another example of how short-term logic rules this race.Meanwhile, the media continue to scratch their heads and quietly panic (think of all the retractions and back pedaling if Trump wins) as Trump continues to win primaries and scoop-up delegates on his way towards a Republican nomination.Watch Rubio s somewhat vain attempt at gutter politics this morning in Texas:   It was amusing to watch CNN interrogators, along with Rubio and Cruz, lay into Trump about his lack of specifics on his healthcare plan. Trump stuck to his canned lines, and generalities, and lost no ground with his supporters either. It should also be said voters don t really care about hearing policy details either, as the population has finally copped on to the fact that candidates will say anything to get elected and that no president will ever make good on his or her campaign promises. Eight years of Obama taught America that lesson once and for all.Throughout the CNN event, Trump would point out individual corporate lobbyists in the audience from various industries including the pharmaceutical industry. The fact of the matter here is, despite painting themselves as rebels and  DC outsiders , both Rubio and Cruz made it on the stage by taking millions of dollars from various Washington DC lobbies. The same special interests have poured fortunes into Super PACs which are presently funding Cruz and Rubio s presidential campaigns and paying for all of their million dollar TV ad slots. Trump, on the other hand, is funding his own campaign and is not bought and paid for.Collectively, between Scott Walker, Jeb Bush, Rick Perry, John Kasich, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, hundreds of millions of dollars have been donated, invested and spent   in order to try and inflate a bloated GOP field   and give lift-off to each one of these political balloons. As it stands now, all of this money will have been spent in vain. The only winners will be the media consultants and PR companies who produced mountains campaign ads and printed material, and also the TV networks, like CNN, FOX and the others, who ran all of those costly political ads.Towards the end of CNN s gladiatorial event last night, Trump got the last word, and again, it reflected the public mood and thus will further galvanize his support base. He exclaimed: Politicians are all talk, no action   just like these two here (Cruz and Rubio)  Look what s happening to our country. Trade, vets, common core, Obamacare: I ll get it done, they won t, and we will Make America Great Again. Once again, it s not a question of whether voters believe everything he says, or like everything he does. Just as Jimmy Carter was to cure for Nixon s epic corruption, and the Simple Jack approach of George W. Bush was the beneficiary of Bill Clinton s shameful antics in the Oval office, and just as Barack Obama was the natural reaction to the nation s WMD shame and intellectual inadequacy of two terms of George W. Bush   so too is Donald Trump the natural progression following eight years of divisive partisan  lead from behind  community organizer-in-chief politics by Barack Obama.If Trump does win the nomination in July, then this general election will be one of the most rancorous contests in American history.  The real fun has only just begun.READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"February 26, 2016"
23436,HIDDEN ORDER: Was the Death of Justice Scalia Linked to ‘Secret Society’ at Cibolo Ranch?,"Shawn Helton   21st Century WireWith the United States in the heat of the 2016 presidential election cycle, key questions surrounding the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia continue to persist  as there s a new conspiratorial twist added to an already suspicious case.Recently, here at 21WIRE, we discussed many of the strange circumstances observed in the aftermath of Justice Scalia s death. The 79-year-old conservative justice was found dead in his hotel room at Cibolo Creek Ranch, a luxury ranch located in Presidio County, Texas.There was no official autopsy made by a medical examiner in Scalia s death, only a controversial pronouncement over the phone by Presidio County Judge Cinderela Guevara.As 21WIRE pointed out in an earlier report regarding Scalia, Guevara appears to have reversed her previous statement claiming that Scalia had died of a  heart attack , revising the cause of death to  natural causes.  Guevara s handling of the death scene of a Supreme Court Justice without being present has drawn sharp criticism from both the media and the public.  ORIGINAL MEANING  Controversial conservative firebrand, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. (Photo illustration 21WIRE)Secret Order, Secret Death?On February 24th, The Washington Post published an article entitled  Justice Scalia spent his last hours with members of this secretive society of elite hunters : When Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died 12 days ago at a West Texas ranch, he was among high-ranking members of an exclusive fraternity for hunters called the International Order of St. Hubertus, an Austrian society that dates back to the 1600s. Continuing, The Washington Post confirmed that indeed, the FBI will not be conducting an investigation into Supreme Court Justice Scalia s death. On an interesting note however, the article states that the FBI was unaware of the secretive international order all together: Law enforcement officials told The Post that they had no knowledge of the International Order of St. Hubertus or its connection to Poindexter and ranch guests. The officials said the FBI had declined to investigate Scalia s death when they were told by the marshals that he died from natural causes.   CLOAK & DAGGER    Members of The International Order of Saint Hubertus, from left: John Kotts, Boysie Bollinger, Vidal Martinez, Reed Morian and John Poindexter. (Photo link chron)The Washington Post article also revealed the identity of Scalia s travel partners:  C. Allen Foster, a prominent Washington lawyer who traveled to the ranch with Scalia by private plane,  and that Cibolo Creek Ranch owner John Poindexter, along with C. Allen Foster, had flown with Scalia to the ranch for the now infamous quail-hunting trip.Also according to the Post, both Poindexter and Foster,  hold leadership positions within the [Saint Hubertus] Order. It is unclear what, if any, official association Scalia had with the group. While the Post acknowledged that many of the 35 guests in attendance at Cibolo Creek Ranch have remained largely unknown to the public eye, they discuss some of the details surrounding the St. Hubertus order, an international brotherhood whose founding member, Count Franz Anton von Sporck , also started a branch of Freemasonry in Bohemia (now the Czech Republic): Members of the worldwide, male-only society wear dark-green robes emblazoned with a large cross and the motto  Deum Diligite Animalia Diligentes,  which means  Honoring God by honoring His creatures,  according to the group s website. The conspiratorial coincidence doesn t end there, it was also revealed that  The society s [Saint Hubertus] U.S. chapter launched in 1966 at the famous Bohemian Club in San Francisco.   CIBOLO CONSPIRACY    What really happened to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. (Photo link twitter)Magic Bullets Become  Magic Pillows Another bizarre element to this story, was the description and discovery of Scalia s body when it was first found by Cibolo Creek ranch owner, Poindexter. This aspect of the story is illustrated very clearly in a passage from the blog Followship of the Minds: On February 14, 2016, in an article for mySA (MySanAntonio) titled,  Texas Ranch owner recalls Scalia s last hours, reporter John MacCormack quoted Poindexter: We discovered the judge in bed, a pillow over his head.Everything was in perfect order. He was in his pajamas, peacefully, in bed. His bed clothes were unwrinkled. He was lying very restfully. It looked like he had not quite awakened from a nap. On February 17, Poindexter  clarified  his comment to the New York Daily News that  There was a pillow over his head, not over his face. The face was entirely clear. And now, the latest.David Warren reports for the AP that according to a Presidio County Sheriff s Office incident report obtained by The Washington Post on Feb. 23, nothing appeared out of place around Scalia s bed. Three pillows were stacked to elevate Scalia s head. A top pillow appeared to have toppled onto his eyes and forehead but didn t appear positioned to impede his breathing.  Scalia s  arms were at his side atop the bed covers, which were pulled up to his chin. The bed covers were smooth and creased and showed no sign of a struggle. That is one magic pillow!First, it was over Scalia s head.Then, it was above Scalia s head, whose face was  entirely clear .Now, the pillow is neither over nor above Scalia s head, but partially covering his face ( toppled onto his eyes and forehead ), although the pillow made sure to position itself so as not to  impede his breathing .   SECRETS IN CIBOLO    The scenic surroundings of Cibolo Creek Ranch. (Photo link tripadvisor)While you have to wonder about the confusion surrounding Scalia s pillow placement, The Washington Post s recent eye-opening revelations regarding the Order of St. Hubertus   give us some other things to consider Silencing Conspiracy with ConspiracyThe overtly conspiracy-tinged Post piece is a rarity in the mainstream world, one that conjure s many Hollywood or government tales of murder, deception and intrigue throughout history.The acknowledgement of a decadent Eyes Wide Shut-like  secret society  on location at Cibolo Creek Ranch prior to Scalia s death, only enhances the drive by voyeurism witnessed since his passing and in a way, it could undermine any legitimate investigation into his death after the fact.While its true, this compelling new detail will most likely bring its lion s share of political protest, as well as predictable calls for congressional inquiry or a push for a federal investigation (as should be)   the heavily publicized presence of a secretive fraternal order of hunters nearby a suspicious crime scene, will unfortunately fuel more speculation.Put another way: Whether or not the secret group at Cibolo Creek Ranch was involved in Scalia s death, you have to wonder why the mainstream media revealed this latest conspiratorial element in the first place.Media gatekeepers in television, print and radio will have a field day with this new controversial piece, all the while pushing and pulling the population into a particular corner   and by the looks of it, that s already happening.Having said all of this however, there s still much to be concerned with regarding Scalia s highly suspicious death   OBAMA NO-SHOW    The funeral service for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Oddly, President Obama elected not to attend. (Photo link detroitnewstime)Big Questions RemainOver the years, Scalia s various political connections and political perspective on important issues earned him a controversial reputation.In 2014, Justice Scalia drew harsh criticism for his views on the CIA torture debate, when the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee released a report on the interrogation techniques used since the 9/11 attacks.Whether you agreed or disagreed with Scalia, it s important to note once again that the high court has several pending landmark cases on climate, abortion and immigration, all within weeks or months of his death.The NY Post s recent article entitled  Scalia could have been poisoned: forensic pathologist, raised even more questions about the state of Scalia s body upon being discovered: Lethal poisoning could have left Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia s body in virtually the same condition in which it was found, a top forensic pathologist [Dr. Michael Baden] told The Post on Wednesday. For the time being, were left to wonder what other secrets lie in Cibolo Creek Ranch regarding the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"February 26, 2016"
23437,The Android Affair: Humanity Outsourced,"Randy Johnson 21st Century WireThe future is coming and technology is coming with it.  Are we adapting to the future or holding on to  the old ways ?  Is a future of technology with circuit boards, screens, and machines something that can be weaponized or used to shape and control society  no different than gunpowder, nuclear energy, and marketing?To many, often considered great minds, technology and artificial intelligence has had an ominous role in science fiction in film and literature.  George Orwell, Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clark, and Philip K. Dick are some of the giants of this genre.  Their work has inspired countless Hollywood movies and television programs and can often get someone wondering if life is imitating art, or vice versa.  Another option is that nearly everything has an element of design all along. ANDROID AFFAIR: Big business and robotics (Image Source: WikiCommons)As far back as the 1927 film Metropolis, robotics, class segregation, industry, and even humanity itself, appear on a collision course.

The impact of robotics in industry and its effects in the workforce has also been reported on here at 21st Century Wire.It is a foreboding thing to contemplate, but are we being outsourced?A robot will not call in sick or ask for a wage increase.  It will not fight with others unless programmed to.  It will not complain, throw a fit, collect unemployment, leave early, or join the workers union to fight the corporation.  Once integrated and a part of industry, it will save money.  It will not require an annual review.  When it becomes irrelevant to newer technology, it will be replaced.Getting to a robotic future will even  create new jobs  no doubt.

23439,Syria Ceasefire Deal: A Cynical Ploy by Washington’s ‘Coalition’ to Buy Time for Terrorists,"21st Century Wire says This latest diplomatic development certainly appears positive on its surface, this week s declared  Syrian Ceasefire    a three-way agreement between Washington, Russia and the Syrian government (and begrudgingly by the West s other regional  stakeholders ) looks increasingly like it may just be the latest attempt to buy time   so that Washington, Turkey and Saudi Arabia can re-arm and replenish various militant fighting groups currently laying waste to Syria.Since the entrance of the Russian Air Force into the Syrian conflict theatre last October, the Washington-led Axis has gradually lost proxy-control of a number of key terrorist strongholds in Northern Syria, namely in Aleppo, and thus are unable to dictate crucial  facts on the ground  required to dictate the international media and political narratives. Unable to craft and package these narratives, the West and its dubious  coalition  are completely unable to sell an escalation of military violence in Syria.The fact that the Washington Axis has already threatened to move to a  Plan B    even before the agreement has been implemented, indicates that this diplomatic effort may in fact be  dead on arrival . Before the ink was even dry on the agreement, sources inside the CIA and the Pentagon went public with a preemptive statement claiming that,  Russia cannot be trusted to uphold the ceasefire .

23443,ENCRYPTION TRUTH: What The FBI Aren’t Telling You About Their Battle With Apple And San Bernardino,"Shawn Helton 21st Century WireEarlier this week Apple CEO Tim Cook publicly rejected an unprecedented US Federal Court order that would force the company to decrypt an iPhone linked to one of the San Bernardino shooters   a move that would have vast implications  PRIVACY & PROTECTION: Apple CEO Tim Cook challenges FBI court order to unlock private data of users (Image Source: Iphoneitalia)Breaching Public Privacy In a published open letter entitled,  A Message to Our Customers,   Apple CEO Tim Cook strikingly opposed a recent federal court ruling that would unlock a phone that s been connected to the San Bernardino Mass Shooting case.The FBI ruling stipulates that Apple must provide access for one time only. However, cyber security experts and technology companies insist this is a virtual impossibility and a guarantee that cannot be made.In theory, the decryption of the phone would be opened via a newly created operating system that would give the FBI a backdoor into the device. But according to many skeptics, this type of backdoor feature could set a very dangerous precedent, while possibly making it much easier for invaders (either government, or hacker) mining for data well into the future.In addition, the new iOS (not yet in existence) proposed in the wake of the San Bernardino shooting would give US law enforcement agencies broader access to consumer communications and other private information according to many in the tech industry. This reality was confirmed by Apple s chief executive Cook, who outlined the staggering privacy implications this past Tuesday: The FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation. In the wrong hands, this software   which does not exist today   would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone s physical possession. In essence, the FBI s court order demand appears to bypass basic privacy rights, and when seen in a bigger picture outside of the San Bernardino case, it could be viewed as a violation of the public s 4th Amendment.Challenging The RulingOver the past 48 hours, there s been a social media frenzy, as Facebook, Twitter and Google have all expressed their support for Apple s court battle with federal authorities. This has also included the often entertaining if not perplexing, self-proclaimed  cybersecurity legend  John McAfee of McAfee Inc., who wrote an op-ed published with Business Insider, that dissects the potential fallout of the federal court ruling in similar fashion to that of Cook.Here s some of what the controversial cyber guru turned libertarian presidential hopeful had to say about the dire security circumstances facing Apple and the world at large: Using an obscure law, written in 1789   the All Writs Act   the US government has ordered Apple to place a back door into its iOS software so the FBI can decrypt information on an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters. It has finally come to this. After years of arguments by virtually every industry specialist that back doors will be a bigger boon to hackers and to our nation s enemies than publishing our nuclear codes and giving the keys to all of our military weapons to the Russians and the Chinese, our government has chosen, once again, not to listen to the minds that have created the glue that holds this world together. Continuing, cyber expert McAfee, offered up a glimpse what could transpire in the event of a blackmail scenario if such a digital backdoor were to exist: In spite of the FBI s claim that it would protect the back door, we all know that s impossible. There are bad apples everywhere, and there only needs to be in the US government. Then a few million dollars, some beautiful women (or men), and a yacht trip to the Caribbean might be all it takes for our enemies to have full access to our secrets.   ANTIVIRUS PIONEER    John McAfee, well-known American computer programmer. (Photo businessinsider) McAfee then summarized his op-ed with a ready-made-solution to the FBI s demands by offering his services, I will, free of charge, decrypt the information on the San Bernardino phone, with my team, over a three-week period.On the surface, a sensational gauntlet has been thrown down, calling for the court of public opinion to weigh in on a very important topic concerning privacy rights. But there s much more to it This latest  privacy crisis  might be viewed through a more cynical lens, should readers choose to view this drama as a story featuring controlled opposition   especially when considering the pedigree of those supposedly opposed to the FBI s recent court order.Is it possible that Apple and others have staged opposition to this court decree as a way to bolster their public image, before eventually allowing the rights of private citizens to be abused? Both Cook and McAfee have direct links to companies plagued with security baggage such as Lockheed Martin and IBM, both of which have had their ethics put to question over the years.While there is nothing conclusive here, the public should consider this other side to the story and eliminate inconvenient possibilities in an effort to find the reality of the present circumstances, even if high profile tech leaders may appear to be saying the right things in public, purportedly in the interest of the general population.In an article featured here at 21WIRE from January of 2015, we learned of another privacy threat that should concern the public regarding biometric IDs   as facial and emotional recognition software has already been rolled out without public consent: More Orwellian technology is being rolled out, not just to make you into more of a commodity than you already are, but also to  profile  your emotions. With no regulation on this issue, corporations are basically writing the privacy rules as they go along. Do you trust them? Where is this really heading? In realty, they have no control over how third parties using their software might use images of people s faces and digital signatures of your  emotions , storing, sharing and selling that data across macro platforms. Sure, it s just another new wing of Big Data. Even social media data trawlers like Facebook has already begun moving into facial recognition of their users. So while it is compelling, and quite welcome to hear tech giants calling out the FBI s overreach, it appears that many in the technology sector have already pledged support for a growing police state apparatus by virtue of developing privacy invading software. For the moment though, it appears technology innovators Cook and McAfee, along with other social media companies, seem to be working on behalf of the public s interest, even though it could be out of concern for marketability rather than true worry about where the field of technology has been heading.Apple s iPhone and tablets introduced a biometric ID system with its thumb print login scan in 2013   a system which will store millions of biometric identifiers on Apple cloud servers. It wasn t long after the system was launched before hackers cracked the security for this biometric entry point, exposing another unspeakable privacy breach.If nothing else, it has caused a sharp debate over this pressing subject.  DIGITAL DANGER    The battle for consumer privacy hangs in the balance over the recent FBI court order. (Photo vibratingupdate)Problem, Reaction, SolutionAccording to the Guardian: For months, the FBI searched for a compelling case that would force Apple to weaken iPhone security   and then the San Bernardino shooting happened. This carefully planned legal battle has been months in the making, US officials and tech executives told the Guardian, as the government and Apple try to settle whether national security can dictate how Silicon Valley writes computer code. This past December, those of us at 21WIRE, pointed out a number of inconsistencies relating the heavily dramatized San Bernardino shooting attack. In fact, the media driven shooting attack said to have taken place at the Inland Regional Center had a laundry list of details that didn t add up.After a week of whitewashed reports regarding the shooting, a media scripted ransacking of the alleged  shooters  home (tampering with a potential crime scene) and eyewitness accounts that directly contradicted the official narrative from law enforcement, we learned that in the very room where 14 people were reportedly killed (along with 21 injured) at the Inland Regional Center, there was an  active-shooter  training drill/rehearsal, involving some of the victims almost a year before December s attack to place.Incredibly, a critical component that should be mentioned in the encryption battle involving Apple and the FBI, is that there were multiple eye-witness accounts that directly contradicted the terror-tale blamed solely on Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik. In other words, we have an event largely hinged on a barrage of convoluted and conflicting accounts concerning the San Bernardino attack.The eye-witness accounts near the scene of the shooting, never mentioned anything about seeing a female shooter, which 21WIRE also noted this past December: In fact, authorities did apprehend a third suspect but that aspect of the case, has seemingly gone down the memory hole, as has the very detailed eye-witness testimony from Sally Abdelmageed, (an Inland Regional Center employee) in a CBS interview with Scott Pelley, which clearly states that there were three white men in tactical gear dressed in black involved in the shooting event. Abdelmageed s account, echoed that of Juan Hernandez, who was interviewed shortly after the shooting incident by a local NBC affiliate, where it was described that  three white men in military fatigues,  had fled the scene in black Chevy Impala or SUV. Despite all of this, CNN, ABC, FOX and all other media outlets on the scene   all pivoted, in unison, to validate authorities  (the FBI) revised official  Jihadi Bonnie & Clyde  story of  only 2 shooters   a husband and wife . Additionally, a close colleague from Inland Regional Center, Chris Nwadike, stated that Farook had been acting normal and that  he was quiet,  and that he had not had a disagreement with anyone at the center the day of the shooting. Furthermore, the FBI themselves revealed that both Malik and Farook had not posted radical messages on social media which had previously been reported by authorities (and dutifully repeated across the mainstream media).Even though the media eventually admitted that there were no  radical posts , the idea of  social media postings  became a central story line suggesting that Malik had somehow influenced Farook into participating in the attack. Regardless of what really happened, it seems that the FBI had the opening it needed to try to force open direct access into personal devices.Is it also possible the security agency wants access to the encrypted phone so they can plant an additional back story to a shooting case that never made any sense?Food for thought to chew on in today s digital age As the privacy vs. security battle moves forward, Reuters news agency reports: The U.S. Department of Justice filed a motion on Friday seeking to compel Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to comply with a judge s order to unlock the encrypted iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters, portraying the tech giant s refusal as a  marketing strategy. The future of privacy hangs by a thread, as more and more divide and rule policies are being implemented at the expense of public freedoms.More to come on this story here at 21WIRE READ MORE SCI-TECH NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Sci-Tech FilesREAD MORE DAILY SHOOTER NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Daily Shooter Files",Middle-east,"February 20, 2016"

23445,GLOSSED OVER: Key Questions Emerge After Death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia,"21st Century Wire asks What really happened in the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia?With the United States deep in the throes of the 2016 presidential primaries, the sudden death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has provided a controversial backdrop to an already tense electoral race.Reports state that the 79-year-old conservative justice was found dead this past Saturday in his hotel room at Cibolo Creek Ranch, a luxury ranch located in Presidio County, Texas.  NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN    Several Hollywood films have been shot in the surrounding areas of Cibolo Creek Ranch, including the haunting motion picture No Country For Old Men. (Photo cctoaks.com)The San Antonio Express-News reported that ranch owner, John Poindexter, discovered Scalia s body three hours after first visiting the deceased jurist s hotel room at 8:30 in the morning on Saturday: We discovered the judge in bed, a pillow over his head. His bed clothes were unwrinkled,  the Cibolo Ranch owner told reporters on Monday.  He was lying very restfully. It looked like he had not quite awakened from a nap. As several days have now passed, various theories have surfaced in the aftermath of Scalia s death, causing Poindexter to further clarify his eyewitness account with the Daily News: There was a pillow over his head, not over his face,  said Poindexter.  The face was entirely clear. One of the most troubling aspects of Scalia s death, aside from lack of an autopsy being performed or that Presidio County Judge Cinderela Guevara pronounced the manner of his death over the phone without being present. Later, Guevara appears to have reversed her previous statement claiming that Scalia had died of a  heart attack , revising the cause of death to  natural causes . Resort owner and Democrat Party financier John Poindexter pictured with President Obama.It should also be noted that the resort owner, John Poindexter, is a prominent Democrat Party donor and Obama Award Winner.Another disturbing fact: Justice Scalia was a key vote in temporarily blocking the Clean Power Plan crafted by the White House, a set of new EPA climate regulations, as reported by The Atlantic: On Tuesday [February 9th], the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the rules should neither be implemented nor enforced until the high court itself heard their opponents  case. This was itself unprecedented: Never before had the Supreme Court stayed a set of regulations before a federal court even heard the initial case about them. With the Clean Power Plan looming, there are several upcoming and potentially historic  Supreme Court cases that could be impacted by Scalia s death.Over the years, some have questioned Scalia s various hunting trips and political connections as reported by the LA Times: Scalia engendered criticism in the past over his choice of partners on hunting trips. In 2001, he went on a pheasant hunting trip with the dean of a Kansas law school who was the lead attorney in two cases that were about to come before the Supreme Court. And in 2004, he went duck hunting with then-Vice President Dick Cheney   flying with him on a plane that served as Air Force 2  while the high court was considering a case that challenged the secrecy of an energy task force led by Cheney. Many questions still remain in the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia   which will no doubt prompt speculation well into the foreseeable future.No More Fake News reports below   TIPPING THE BALANCE    Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.  (Photo dallasnews)By John RappoportLet s jump right in with quotes from the Washington Post, 2/15,  Conspiracy theories swirl around the death of Antonin Scalia . The Post published extraordinary statements from the Facebook page of  William O. Ritchie, former head of criminal investigations for D.C. police : As a former homicide commander, I am stunned that no autopsy was ordered for Justice Scalia. You have a Supreme Court Justice who died, not in attendance of a physician. You have a non-homicide trained US Marshal tell the justice of peace that no foul play was observed. You have a justice of the peace pronounce death while not being on the scene and without any medical training opining that the justice died of a heart attack. What medical proof exists of a myocardial Infarction? Why not a cerebral hemorrhage? How can the Marshal say, without a thorough post mortem, that he was not injected with an illegal substance that would simulate a heart attack Did the US Marshal check for petechial hemorrhage in his eyes or under his lips that would have suggested suffocation? Did the US Marshal smell his breath for any unusual odor that might suggest poisoning? My gut tells me there is something fishy going on in Texas. If this isn t enough, the Post goes on: Scalia s physician, Brian Monahan, is a U.S. Navy rear admiral and the attending physician for the U.S. Congress and Supreme Court. He declined to comment on Scalia s [prior] health when reached by telephone Monday at his home in Maryland. Patient confidentiality forbids me to make any comment on the subject,  he said. When asked whether he planned to make public the statement he s preparing for [Texas Judge] Guevara, Monahan repeated the same statement and hung up on a reporter. As long as no law-enforcement investigation of Scalia s death is launched, the doctor is justified. Confidentiality applies, unless Scalia s family lifts it. But if such an investigation is opened, all bets are off. Confidentiality no longer applies.There are reports that, after Scalia s body was transported from the celebrity ranch in Texas, closely guarded and shielded by a bevy of marshals, it was rapidly embalmed. If so, that would apparently make toxicological tests far more difficult or impossible.As for a murder motive, try: upsetting the voting balance of the US Supreme Court. Try: a push to appoint a new Justice now, thus ensuring the appointee s political persuasion, regardless of the outcome of the 2016 Presidential election.Continue this story at No More Fake NewsREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"February 17, 2016"

23447,"‘Zero Knowledge’ Systems Not Hostile to Data Privacy, says Snowden","21st Century Wire says It s been almost two years since the cloud storage provider Dropbox appointed former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to its board. A move Edward Snowden, at the time, called  hostile  for data privacy. Snowden s comments on the matter first appeared in a video interview conducted by the Guardian, and were published in a July 17, 2014 article: Dropbox is a targeted you know wannabe PRISM partner,  he told the Guardian. They just put   Condoleezza Rice on their board  who is probably the most anti-privacy official you can imagine. She s one of the ones who oversaw Stellar Wind and thought it was a great idea. So they re very hostile to privacy. PRISM: The NSA s data collection surveillance program that every citizen should know about. PRISM and Stellar Wind were both approved and implemented during President George W. Bush s administration.  (Image: (c) Adam Hart-Davis)Dropbox and other popular cloud storage providers hold the encryption keys to hand over to the NSA should a request for your data be approved.Snowden endorses zero knowledge  systems. In layman s terms, this means that cloud storage providers NOT hostile to data privacy don t just encrypt your data, but actually host your data without their ability to access it   ever. They have zero knowledge of the contents of your data. It s a big distinction, but one easily missed by a public inundated with confusing doublespeak on data privacy.Snowden adds that s the only way they can prove to the customers that they can be trusted with their information, and makes specific reference to one cloud company, SpiderOak, as a provider of zero knowledge systems.

23448,FBI Arrest Cliven Bundy at Portland Airport – Charged with Federal Conspiracy,"Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireCliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher at the center of the federal standoff in Bunkerville in 2014, was arrested by FBI agents at around 10pm Wednesday evening as he touched down at Portland International Airport. Bundy, 74 yrs old, of Bunkerville, Nevada, was taken to Oregon s Multnomah County detention center and charged with  conspiracy to interfere with a federal officer    the same federal felony charge made two weeks ago against of his two sons, Ammon and Ryan Bundy.According to Oregon Live, Cliven Bundy,  also faces weapons charges,  dating back to the original standoff in April 2014.READ THE FULL FEDERAL COMPLAINT AGAINST CLIVEN BUNDY HERE. Police Mug Shot: Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy was arrested in Portland last night.Bundy s dramatic arrest came as he was planning to meet up with staunch Bundy supporter, Nevada Assemblywoman Michele Fiore, for a Q & A press conference in Portland scheduled for early Thursday morning, presumably to advocate for the Bundy sons and others currently under federal incarceration, and to help mediate a peaceful resolution for the remaining 4 occupiers still held-up at the Malheur Wildlife Refuge outside of Burns, Oregon.The timeline of these events is particularly interesting. Before Cliven Bundy touched down in Portland, Fiore (photo, left) had already arrived in town, but was immediately confronted with a breaking situation on Wednesday afternoon, where reports indicate that there were likely dozens of heavily armed federal tactical and state SWAT members positioned at various points around the perimeter of the occupied federal refuge office building. On Wednesday evening, law enforcement appeared to have decided to make their move to end the occupation by re-taking the protest site and remove its occupants. Fiore then headed to Burns while engaged in a 4 hour-long phone call with the protesters live-streamed on YouTube with nearly 60,000 listeners on the call.Clearly, the FBI had plenty of foreknowledge of Cliven Bundy and Michele Fiore s potentially explosive media spectacle scheduled for this morning. FBI agents appear to have preempted this national (and global) press event by Bundy and Fiore, quickly moving on the protest, and then taking Cliven Bundy out of the equation, or  off the street , as it were. This chain of events over the last 24 hours indicates that the federal government had made decisive moves at key moments   in order to temporarily control the media and political narratives, and by extension, the course of events which have followed. That reality was echoed by Portland attorney, Mike Arnold, currently representing Ammon Bundy, who said earlier today: It s terribly unfortunate the timing of his arrest, given all the progress Assemblywoman Fiore made this evening. In addition to Fiore and Cliven Bundy arriving in Oregon this week, Franklin Graham, son of evangelist Billy Graham, posted on Facebook that he had been talking with the four holdouts for a week,  at their request and at the request of the FBI , and was said to be heading for Burns to witness a peaceful resolution. Early on Thursday, Graham stated the following:  I am on my way there  Please keep them, law enforcement officials, and all involved in your prayers, that everyone will be safe. Presently, federal forces are still at the gates of the refuge, with occupiers still inside. According to the Oregonian, the remaining occupiers are 27-year-old David Fry, the man running the refuge protest YouTube livestream, along with married couple Sean and Sandy Anderson, and one other man known by the name of Jeff Banta. It s not completely clear if all the occupants are armed, and there have been some mixed messages over the last two weeks as to what their exact intentions were, and what concessions were possible through negotiations.UPDATE: 4 holdouts all in FBI custody as occupation endsIn an overwhelming show of force, the FBI have surrounded the small one story detached Malheur office building with MRAP armored vehicles and other assets, including multiple surveillance drones positioned overhead. It s not known exactly how many federal agents are in position at the refuge and the surrounding area, but based on similar events, the number could be at least 300, not including state and other law enforcement agents.At the end of January, a team of federal and state agents shot and killed the protest s spokesman, Arizona rancher, Robert  Lavoy  Finicum, in what can only be described as a well-organize, federal and state ambush, involving dozens of vehicles and armed agents (including snipers) positioned along an isolated rural stretch of  Oregon highway 395. The mainstream media are still disingenuously referring to the event as a  traffic stop incident    in what appears to be a well-coordinated PR effort to minimize any accusations of over-reach on the part of the federal agencies.The left-wing arm of the media, and a virtual army of anti-Bundy activists online will certainly be celebrating this latest development as a  government victory .With the iconic face of the public lands issue, Cliven Bundy, now in custody, this will either stir the burgeoning  Constitutionalist  movement, or it will further demoralize it.Cliven Bundy is expected to appear in a Portland federal court this afternoon.Watch this space.READ MORE OREGON STANDOFF NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Oregon Files",Middle-east,"February 11, 2016"

23450,"Will American Law Enforcement Lie, Cheat and Forge Police Reports? Answer: Yes.","21st Century Wire says The issue of honest policing and institutional corruption within law enforcement has been exercised over and over, with every high-profile controversy. Certainly, 2015 had its fair share of these kind of incidents.The issue of institutional corruption still goes unattended however, as media seem to prefer the obsession of spinning every story in terms of race, or class, rather than seriously looking at the problem of devolving so much power and blind authority that are by their very nature   often corrupt.Where is the DOJ, and where is the President weighing-in? Where are the race mobs? Is this story not sexy enough for the media?This latest story should be a warning to everyone about what would likely be systemic in the fully-functioning police state which Washington DC is currently attempting to construct under the noses of its citizens  Matt Kessler GuardianSince 26-year-old Ricky Ball was shot and killed by police in October, the black community in Columbus, Mississippi, has grappled with questions that don t have clear answers.Why did police shoot Ball that night? Why did a string of police officials resign in the months that followed? And why did police claim Ball stole a gun from a police officer s home only after his death?Attempts to obtain police documents about the case have raised a new question: why did police release two different versions of events from the shooting?Documents obtained by the Guardian show police altered a document labeled  uniform incident report  in Ball s death.

23451,3.57 Degrees: Kevin Bacon’s Cultural Mantle Shattered By Zuckerberg,"21st Century Wire says Unless you have been living under a rock for the last 20 years, you would have heard about the cultural meme known as the  Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon , Hollywood s own lowbrow revision derived from John Guare s famous 1990 play about the  Six Degrees of Separation .So popular was Bacon s cultural quirk, that the Gods of Google even launched a web tool called the  Baconator  where users can plug in the name of anyone in order to measure how many degrees of separation there are between you and them.  If I m about to go to work with someone, I ll check their name on the call sheet, and then I ll go to Google, and you can put in their name plus  bacon number,  and that will tell you how many degrees of separation there are. It ll tell [me] if I worked with them,  said Bacon to TV host James Corden recently.Just as the Baconator was getting going, Kevin was usurped, like everyone and everything else, by the ever-engulfing digital vortex known as Facebook and its hoodie-wearing billionaire co-founder Mark Zuckerberg.Poor Kevin. According to new data published by the social networking behemoth, Facebook people are separated by only 3.57 degrees of separation. Casey Williams from the Huff Post explains,  One caveat about this research, though: It applies only to the 1.59 billion people who are active on Facebook. Given that there are more than 7 billion people on the planet, and that over four billion still lack regular access to the Internet, it s unlikely that the new theory holds for humans at large. The down side of course (although Facebook will never publish its trolling data), is that you are also more closely connected with thousands, if not millions of trolls and their phony, malicious sock-puppet accounts too.Even worse, as 21WIRE discovered late last week   Facebook can and will, without any warning whatsoever   and with ZERO human feedback on their end   block and disable your ability to share information with your peers through its user groups. When asked, the reason given by Facebook was simply,  You re going too fast.  No, we re not kidding  Once again, thank you Mr. Zuckerberg for allowing your robots to kill people s ability to share news and information.When they say  degrees of separation    they really mean separation.READ MORE SCI-TECH NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Sci-Tech Files",Middle-east,"February 9, 2016"
23452,Bernie Sanders Could End Up Winning Iowa,"21st Century Wire says Iowa s Democratic Party primary was one of the closest races in history   reported by the media as being decided by only .3% of the vote, with Hillary Clinton supposedly taking that narrow victory. But has Hillary really secured a victory in Iowa?According to National Review, the answer is  no . Beltway correspondent Quinn Hillyer explains: The final count of delegates to the state convention (aside from the seven won by Martin O Malley) was Clinton 699, Sanders 695. But by actual voter decisions, the count was Sanders 695, Clinton 693, and six ties. Sure, Clinton right now goes to the state convention with four more committed delegates than Sanders, but she didn t win her margin via voters, but by a mathematically bizarre series of coin flips. For those with a short-term memory, fours years ago in 2012, the mainstream media called the Iowa primary for then GOP candidate Mitt Romney, only to retract this later when it was discovered that Rick Santorum had actually won the caucus majority. And even then, neither Romney, nor Santorum won the majority of delegates from Iowa going into the national convention. That victory went to party rebel Ron Paul   an uncomfortable fact universally ignored at the time by major U.S. broadcast media outlets. Paul achieved this incredible victory because his campaign organizers understood what the Iowa Caucuses essentially are: a giant, statewide straw poll, by pursuing one of the most aggressive delegate strategies ever. So bad was the GOP fall-out from this event, that the Republican National Convention drafted new bylaws to deal with the  Ron Paul Problem , making sure that no insurgent candidate could ever gain a state foothold without the approval of the GOP party elite.Likewise, if Bernie Sanders has done the necessary groundwork in pursuing a more aggressive county-level delegate strategy on election day, and then follows-up with securing candidate Martin O Malley s at least 5 of the 7  free agent  delegates who will be available to switch their loyalties (due to O Malley dropping out of the race) at the upcoming Iowa State Convention, then Sanders could eventually be Iowa s real delegate winner.21WIRE s Patrick Henningsen spoke to RT International about the Sanders campaign s latest call for a vote recount, as well as other controversial aspects of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, including the Donald Trump vs Ted Cruz scandal.

23453,Plastic Persona: Behind the Scenes of the Ted Cruz Media Machine,"21st Century Wire says Most people accept that a certain amount of political campaigning is staged, and even a little contrived at times.For the most part, the public is fairly unaware of just how fabricated the political images they see on TV really are.Earlier, 21WIRE showed the abysmal scene from GOP candidate Jeb Bush s recent staged town hall meeting. As bad as that Jeb moment was, it almost pales in comparison to what s on offer here After their narrow Iowa GOP caucus victory this week, the Cruz campaign took a cheeky swipe at rival Donald Trump. Cruz communications director Rick Tyler remarked to CNN after the final results were announced,  Reality hit the realty TV star in Iowa, so nobody is talking about him now, so he s trying to regain some attention on Twitter. After watching the following behind-the-scenes video out-takes from the Rafael Edward, or  Ted  Cruz campaign machine, one could easily make the argument that it s Cruz who is putting up the dramatic TV facade, and even using his own family members as political props.

Although Jeb managed to get only 2.8% of the Iowa GOP caucus vote, he still has sufficient funds in his political war chest to carry on. Despite the fact that he appears to be more intelligent and compos mentis than his brother George, he still struggles to gain mass appeal.As campaign moments go, however, this has got to be one of the saddest, most doleful moments we ve seen yet. During one of Jeb s many staged,  Meet Jeb  town hall-style meetings, where segments are filmed in order to extract outtakes for use in an endless series of campaign ads, Jeb finished a good speaking stretch before sheepishly turning to a mostly disinterested audience, quietly begging them to clap for the cameras.You have to see it to believe it.

23456,Eyewash: CIA Elites Misleading Employees Indicates That Conspiracies Are NOT ‘Ridiculous Fantasy’,"21st Century Wire says The CIA is trying its best to avoid oversight and accountability.Watch a video of this report here: An anonymous ex-CIA officer explains: The classic use of an eyewash is if you have a garden-variety source and all of a sudden he gains access to truly sensitive information, What you might do is have a false communication saying the guy got hit by a bus and died. The large number of people aware of this source suddenly think he is dead. But the continuing reporting on that source and from that source gets put into a very closed compartment that few would know about. In one documented example, CIA officials said that a senior Al-Qaeda member was killed as a result of tribal violence. Yet, in actual fact, the terrorist had been killed by a drone strike.The intent behind this eyewash was to conceal the then-secret CIA drone program in Pakistan.Former CIA inspector general, Fred Hitz, said that deliberately misleading employees is really playing with fire. Steven Aftergood, a government secrecy expert at the Federation of American Scientists, said, When you introduce falsehoods into the communications stream then you can destabilize the whole system of intelligence oversight and compliance with the law. What now needs to be examined is the extent to which this practice still takes places today and who exactly receives the accurate information. Is the true information ever sent to elected officials, or always withheld by this shadow government operating essentially on its own?Interestingly, it is often said by skeptics that any part of the government could never be involved in a monumental conspiracy because too many people would have to know about it, and someone would talk.The exposure of the eyewashing program now crushes this argument, as it reveals to us the extreme extent of compartmentalisation that exists within the modern American government that is capable of hiding the most despicable activities.It is also likely that many other government agencies employ similar tactics, in order to ensure that those at the top stay there and threats to their power can be dealt with quietly. Departments look out for themselves, and particularly their own relevance.Naturally, this intelligence phenomenon extends into the media, as mainstream media outlets always rely on their internal agency  sources  for any  inside information    which could  misleading, or completely false.What might they do, and subsequently try to hide, to ensure they stay relevant?READ MORE ON THE CLANDESTINE CIA: 21st Century Wire CIA Files",Middle-east,"February 3, 2016"
23457,Activist: ‘This is where you can make the most impact’,"21st Century Wire says If you ve been following the events outside of Burns, Oregon, you ll have seen 99% of the news coverage has been about the presence of  armed militia  and endless rumors of FBI  Waco Siege  plots   and not about the core legal issues surrounding the Hammond family. These stories often start out as local issues, then quickly spin out of control and end up being managed and contested at the Federal level.Sunday Wire host Patrick Henningsen spoke to independent activist Jason Casella from PANDA UNITE and the Solutions Institute about his recent experience at the Oregon Standoff, and also about America s  crisis of liberty , as well as some positive trends in activism today. Casella advocates getting closer to the sources of power and decision making in your local community: You have to make sure that your city council and county commission is acting on behalf of the people, and acting within the restraints of the Constitution, before you can ask somebody in DC, for example, or even at your state level of representatives. This is where you can actually have the most impact. Listen to the full interview with Jason Casella below.LISTEN TO MORE SUNDAY WIRE: Sunday Wire Show Archives",Middle-east,"February 3, 2016"

23459,FBI Release Oregon Video Footage Depicting Death of Robert Lavoy Finicum – But Questions Remain,"21st Century Wire says..UPDATE 1-29-2016 at 01:30PM ET: Due to public pressure and intense speculation about the events of Tuesday brought on by a YouTube recording of the testimony of key eyewitness Victoria Sharp, the FBI has released the unedited aerial video footage from Tuesday evening s incident which took place along Highway 395. According to the official FBI statement:  We feel that it is necessary to show the whole thing unedited in the interest of transparency.  The FBI video entitled,  Complete, Unedited Video of Joint FBI and OSP Operation 01/26/2016 , does show the victim Lavoy Finicum exiting the truck awkwardly in at least two feet of snow, and he clearly does not  charge towards  the SWAT team, and his hands are clearly held high above his head as he exits his truck when confronted by a SWAT team, before being shot multiple times by marksmen and falling in the snow. Also, the scale and size of this operation is very evident by the footage, and the apprehension of the protesters was not the result of a mere  traffic stop  as it was wrongly characterized in multiple mainstream media reports.The FBI has also titled their release as  unedited  which shows a window of 26 min and 29 seconds, but it would be interesting to see any drone footage prior to where their clip begins, to further determine how long the drone was filming the vehicles of Finicum and Bundy. This is important because it would shed further light the premeditated nature of the confrontation that the media and government  sources  have called a  traffic stop . On its own, this FBI drone footage would appear to support previous government and media claims by CNN, Washington Post and others that the victim was indeed  reaching towards his waistband  which gave federal and state police justification to unleash deadly force. However, it is still not completely clear from this aerial footage whether or not Finicum was holstered (he is said to normally carry a gun on the right hip, but FBI are claiming he had a 9mm gun in his inside left breast pocket), but also whether or not he lowered his arms before, or after he was shot multiple times. For example, if Finicum had his hands in the air and was then was shot in the abdomen first, then any man s natural reaction would be to then lower his hand(s) and clutch the wound. Additionally, if any shots were fired, even in the vicinity, then confusion could have ensued which might have prompted Finicum to reach for his weapon. Either way, it is impossible to make any such a forensic determination without a corresponding audio track  which would help to determine if any shots were fired before Finicum s hand(s) could be seen lowering.  WARNING: The following images depict violence and death which some readers may find disturbing. Watch:Watch the edited version here:  Finicum appears to temporarily lose his balance in the snow at the very moment he looks to be hit by agents.What is clear however from this video is that armed agents did not shoot to disable their suspect, but shot to kill and even had a laser sight trained on him for many minutes after he was downed. Clearly, multiple SWAT shooters could be seen emerging from the woods. After killing Finicum, police then left the victim to bleed to death laying in the snow and did not check on him for at least another 8 minutes.Flash-bang rounds can be seen around the 14:00 mark of the FBI s  unedited  version, and the FBI has said that it fired CS gas and  non lethal rounds  (possibly pepper spray rounds, or rubber bullets) are said to have been fired at the truck while the passengers were inside. This begs the question: with nonlethal rounds already in play   why did multiple SWAT shooters use so many deadly rounds against Finicum when he exited the truck with his hands up?READ MORE OREGON STANDOFF NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Oregon Files",Middle-east,"January 29, 2016"
23460,Trial By YouTube: Mainstream Media Use Second-hand Oregon Account to Cast Blame on Dead Rancher," Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireThere exists a famous quote often attributed to 1918 US Senator Hiram Warren Johnson, who once said,  The first casualty when war comes is truth.  The same could be said for Waco, or Ruby Ridge   or with the federal government s version of recent events in Burns, Oregon.  What really happened on Highway 395? We re not sure yet, but in the meantime, it seems as if the mainstream media have already decided who is guilty and and who is not.Regarding the Tuesday evening s events at the Oregon Standoff, where federal agents shot and killed rancher Robert  Lavoy  Finicum, a campaign of disinformation appears to be rapidly underway. The following is a prime exhibit of how the mainstream media can spin a story to favor the government version of events.The Washington Post s brash headline reads,  Report: LaVoy Finicum, armed with a handgun, reached for his waistband just before he was shot. In the absence of any actual evidence, or even analysis to support this deceptive headline, instead Washington Post writer Mike Miller attempts to weave together a classic example of yellow journalism.Any speculation or public skepticism could be easily put to rest by the FBI releasing all video footage of the event in question. (Above screen shot: Washington Post)Miller begins his piece establishing Finicum s guilt in his own murder by nature of the fact that Robert  Lavoy  Finicum had been seen previously carrying a gun. Everyone knew that LaVoy Finicum kept a Colt .45 on his hip. That common knowledge could help explain how the occupier in Oregon died. Miller s article then hammers home the federal thesis that any injured or dead protesters  brought it on themselves : The occupiers had ample opportunity to leave peacefully,  FBI Special Agent Greg Bretzing said Wednesday morning.  They brought this on themselves. In other words, according to the FBI, and with the help of the media, dead rancher Lavoy Finicum is guilty in the court of public opinion.Marginalizing the WitnessMiller immediate moves to cast doubt on the testimony of 18 yr old Victoria Sharp, who was a passenger in the truck Finicum was driving, crassly describing the young woman as a  self-described witness . He adds: Another self-described witness disputes that, saying that authorities opened fire before the getaway chase and that Finicum had his hands up when he was shot.  STOIC: Ammon Bundy, Ryan Bundy and Lavoy Finicum at the Wildlife Refuge last week.Instead, Miller relies heavily on a YouTube video recorded and uploaded by a man named Mark McConnell who was not at the scene of the actual shooting (he admits that he was one mile away) when federal agents reportedly killed Finicum. Admittedly, McConnell s testimony, claiming that Finicum had  charged at the officers  is only second-hand, or possibly third-hand, depending on the accuracy of what he is attempting relaying from other passengers riding with in the vehicle with Sharp at the time, Ryan Payne and Shawna Cox.Here, McConnell is, in effect, issuing a proxy statement on behalf of Victoria Sharp s fellow passengers, Shawn Cox and Ryan Payne. This is hardly admissible, as both Cox and Payne are currently in federal custody and are not able to verify the accuracy of McConnell reiteration. And yet, mainstream media outlets are propping-up McConnell s account as if it were somehow factual.Clearly, this is a  nudging  exercise, carefully attempting to minimize and discredit the young female witness Sharp. The Post s Miller makes this blatantly obvious when he subtly inserts that Sharp,  who said she was the 18 year old in the car with Finicum . What?  Who said she was the 18 yr old ? Here is in context: McConnell s account conflicts with statements made by Victoria Sharp, who said she was the 18-year-old in the car with Finicum. One would think that a Washington Post headline journalist would have ample resources to confirm whether or not Sharp was in the truck or not.Why are mainstream media outlets so quick to try and discredit the testimony of Victoria Sharp? Unlike the mainstream media s  go-to  man McConnell, Victoria Sharp is an actual eye witness who saw first-hand the fateful event in question, and described it in detail immediately after the event during a phone interview. What s more amazing is how a newspaper like the Washington Post, presumably with a good reputation for high journalistic standards (one would think so anyway) would grab a recycled, second-hand account which first appeared on the tabloid news website Raw Story.What The Post is attempting to do here is clear: to try and align a secondhand speculative guess by McConnell with a vague  anonymous  statement leaked from the FBI to CNN.Sadly for news consumers, it s not uncommon that networks like CNN will often accept vague anonymous leaks from  sources  in order to construct an official narrative of any event   with absolutely zero accountability from either the government source, or the news network.It s almost as if Miller is writing this piece on behalf of the FBI.At the very least here, the Washington Post is playing a supporting role   acting as an additional PR channel and echo chamber for a claim which neither CNN or the government are required to either confirm or deny. Sources  Say Finicum Was Reaching for His WaistbandRather than question any of the claims fashioned by CNN and its  sources  journalist Mike Miller does the opposite   he tries to reinforce the government narrative.CNN International s report hinges on a  anonymous government source  claiming that Finicum was killed by federal agents because he was  reaching towards his waistband.  Miller writes: In the moments before he was shot by authorities Tuesday afternoon, Finicum led a high-speed getaway attempt. He then reached for his waistband, prompting authorities to open fire, according to a CNN report.The report, which cites anonymous law enforcement officials but has not been confirmed by The Washington Post, is corroborated by a statement from an occupier who said he was traveling with Finicum at the time of the traffic stop. The fact the media have chosen to label this incident as a  traffic stop  indicates an obvious agenda designed to minimize the obvious   that this was a pre-planned, elaborate ambush by the FBI and Oregon State Police.The Washington Post then tries to enhance CNN s phantom report by aligning the government narrative with the second-hand story presented by Mark McConnell, further propping-up the government s version of events:This same unnamed  source  cited by CNN has also told the network that the incident was captured on video by the FBI, but that authorities  have not decided whether or not the release the video. One indication that this anonymous leak to CNN is likely bogus is the fact that the statement says Finicum  reached for his waistband , but chose not to say,  reached for his gun    which offers the government a convenient exit from their previous statement should an unincriminating video ever surface for public viewing. In addition, the fact that the alleged damning video has not already been released could mean that the video footage in question does not support the government innuendo story which has been leaked out via government-media information channels.Any public distrust or skepticism of the federal authorities would immediately be dispelled by speed release of all video footage (with dozens of agents and surveillance, there should have been more than one video feed taken, including body and gun sight cameras) of the event. Whether or not, and how fast this will happen remains to be seen.Two Versions of EventsWhat s abundantly clear after listening to both McConnell and Sharp s conflicting testimonies, is that McConnell s statement  is quite obviously unreliable and full of self-contradictions and caveats, while Sharp s is clear and concise.The following is the testimony of Victoria Sharp, recorded in the immediate aftermath of the shooting on Oregon highway 395:  Anyone looking at this story can see clearly that protesters  vehicles were traveling to a pre-arranged community event in the nearby small town of John Day   an event supported by neighboring Grant County Sheriff Glenn Palmer. Palmer was sympathetic to the Bundy s protest and publicly called for the release of the Hammond family whom he believes were wrongfully imprisoned. Oregon Live reported the Palmer was there at the FBI roadblock on Highway 395 alongside a large contingent of armed Federal Agents. If true, this would indicates that Palmer had prior knowledge federal ambush, but more importantly, that he clearly ceded his own legal and Consitutional authority as the county s chief law enforcement official over to the FBI s special agent in charge Greg Bretzing. Absent of any public statement from Palmer on the matter, onlookers can only speculate about this situation.IMPORTANT NOTE (UPDATE 1-30-16): According to this recent report by Pedro Quintana from Central Oregon local affiliate News Channel 21, Sheriff Palmer was not at the federal roadblock and had no prior knowledge of the FBI ambush of the Bundy convoy. According to the chat session relayed in Pedro Quintana s report, Palmer was asked in an online chat,  Did you witness Lavoy shooting, or no? , to which Palmer replies,  NO  The shooting from what I hear was close to 4 and I heard of it at about 5:45pm.  News 21continued: Palmer responded he had no knowledge of anything about the plans or who was coming to the public meeting. He went on to say that the  FBI and Oregon State Police know me, they shared nothing with me and they know I wouldn t have allowed it. Earlier mainstream media reports that Palmer was present at the FBI roadblock would lead Bundy supporters to believe that Palmer had betrayed the Bundys and Lavoy Finicum. One the main sources, if not the main source of the original Sheriff Palmer controversy appears to be none other than Oregon Live staff writer Les Zaitz who has slipped-in this key piece of line into his report which which says: They said they didn t know how long the roadblock would be place. Grant County Sheriff Glenn Palmer was there.  Not surprisingly, this has set-off a virtual backlash online against the Grant County Sheriff, as evidenced by the following screen shot of Google search link found here:  Is this a case of media dirty tricks by Oregon Live? Certainly, Oregon Live s coverage of Burns events has been skewed from the beginning, and have been running character assassination pieces against Malheur occupiers in a effort to discredit the protest. Sheriff Palmer is clearly on record as being sympathetic to the Hammond Ranch protest and had recently opened up a constructive dialogue with the Bundys and occupiers from Malheur Wildlife Refuge. If Pedro Quintana s News 21 report is indeed accurate, then one might conclude that Oregon Live put out a piece of disinformation, likely designed to further divide the protest movement and create dissension in militia and activist ranks. However, until Sheriff Glenn Palmer comes out and issues clear statement declaring where he was   and where he wasn t, then people will continue to speculate what really happened. (END OF UPDATE)NOTE: See more in depth and legal analysis on Sheriff Palmer and the FBI s operation at Free Capitalist.Amazingly, The Post s writer Mike Miller goes on to all but admit a premeditated ambush of the protester s vehicles on Highway 395, and yet, will not call it what it was   an ambush: According to the CNN report, the FBI and Oregon State Police had been watching occupiers come and go from the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge near Burns for days before they spotted a rare opportunity to nab the militant movement s leaders all at once: Finicum, Ammon Bundy, Ryan Bundy and a handful of others climbed into two trucks and drove from the refuge to a meeting in John Day, Ore., two hours north. Authorities chose a cold, deserted stretch of highway to attempt a traffic stop. One vehicle complied with orders and pulled over, but the other  allegedly driven by Finicum  sped off at high speed, according to the report. It should be noted (although never by the Washington Post or CNN) that the protest s leader, Ammon Bundy, had met with FBI negotiators that morning continuing an open dialogue that had been going on for weeks. This, plus the fact that Sheriff Palmer had invited Bundy and his fellow protesters to the community event in John Day, demonstrated that both the Federal government and the local Sheriff had acted in bad faith by drawing all of the main protesters out to the town of John Day, along a pre-planned route, before staging such an ambush with overwhelming force just hours later. The fact that a man is dead definitely underlines the seriousness of their course of action   which appears to be a case of deception on the part of authorities.Similarly, right after the event most mainstream media were calling the event a  shoot-out , even though it was obvious that no shots were fired by vehicle passengers. Granted, such deceptive language by media is nothing new, but it s still further indication that there was a deliberate attempt to skew the narrative in favor of law enforcement s official version of events.UPDATE 1-28-2016 at 11:30PM ET: Due to public pressure and intense speculation about the events of Tuesday evening, and because of the YouTube recording of 18 yr old eye witness Victoria Sharp, the FBI has released the unedited aerial video footage from Tuesday evening s incident which took place along Highway 395 here. According to the official FBI statement:  We feel that it is necessary to show the whole thing unedited in the interest of transparency.

23463,"Eyewitness Says Feds Ambushed Bundys, 100 Shots Fired at Passengers, Lavoy Finicum Killed With ‘Hands Up’","Patrick Henningsen 21st Century Wire UPDATE: 1-30-2016 Last night, the standoff at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge outside Burns, Oregon took a rather ugly turn which resulted in one man shot dead and another wounded by federal agents.The latest incident took place as two vehicles carrying protesters, led by Ammon Bundy, were en route to a community meeting in the nearby town of John Day in Oregon.According to numerous mainstream media reports and local media outlet Oregon Live,  federal sources  are telling the media that only  3 shots were fired , but a new eye witness testimony by one of the vehicle s passengers tells a very different story.While the mainstream media is still referring to the event as  a shoot-out , according to this latest eye witness account at the scene   no shots were fired by vehicle passengers.According to eyewitness Victoria Sharp, 18 yrs old, from Kansas, who was a passenger in the same truck driven by Arizona rancher Robert  Lavoy  Finicum, along with Ryan Bundy, Ryan Payne and Shawna Cox   dozens of federal vehicles and countless agents were waiting for the group, pre-positioned at a point along the isolated rural Highway 395, before intercepting the group and detaining 8 persons, including brothers Ammon and Ryan Bundy, who were booked into Multnomah County Jail early this morning.Sharp confirmed that the passengers never drew weapons and attempted to get out of their vehicles before federal agents fired  at least 120 shots altogether  at the vehicle carrying her party.RELATED:  Federal Government Escalated the Violence in Oregon Federal agents fired their first shots at passenger and militia leader, Ryan Payne, as he attempted to make contact with the agents by sticking his head and hands out of the window, at which point Payne got back inside the vehicle.Payne then exited the truck and was detained before driver Finicum advanced the vehicle further down the road before sliding into a snow bank on the side of the road.A second vehicle, a Jeep with passengers including Ammon Bundy, had already been stopped by authorities, with its all passengers taken into custody with no one harmed.A third vehicle driving approximately one mile ahead at the front of the convoy, carrying Sharp s mother and young siblings, was allowed to pass through the police roadblocks without incident. Finicum then attempted to drive around the next federal road block, but lost control of the vehicle before careening into snow piled on the road s hard shoulder.After crashing into the snow bank on the side of the highway, the driver, 54 yr old Arizona resident, Lavoy Finicum (photo, above), then exited the vehicle, visibly upset and with his hands in the air, before being gunned down by federal agents. Finicum was walking with his hands in the air, daring federal agents,  Just shoot me! Just shoot me    at which point the agents shot him dead. The witness testimony indicates that his hands were still in the air.Numerous  red dots  from lasers could be seen pointed on the passengers by federal marksmen, in what was described by this witness as an  ambush  by federal authorities. Sharps said,  I had 20 lasers on me when I got out of the car. She also confirmed that Ryan Bundy was shot and wounded in the arm by federal agents was shot while still inside the truck.Federal forces then followed-up by firing CS tear gas rounds around the vehicle, apparently in an attempt to further disable the remaining passengers.At least 40 federal vehicles, as well as many armed federal agents including some seen emerging from the surrounding forest along the highway, should leave little doubt as to the scale and nature of the operation.Listen to Ms. Sharp s harrowing testimony here: IMPORTANT NOTE (UPDATE 1-30-16): According to this recent report by Pedro Quintana from Central Oregon local affiliate News Channel 21, Sheriff Palmer was not at the federal roadblock and had no prior knowledge of the FBI ambush of the Bundy convoy. According to the chat session relayed in Pedro Quintana s report, Palmer was asked in an online chat,  Did you witness Lavoy shooting, or no? , to which Palmer replies,  NO  The shooting from what I hear was close to 4 and I heard of it at about 5:45pm.

Zaitz s article even admits that McConnell s vehicle was at least 200 yards behind the truck driven by Finicum.Incredibly, Oregonian Zaitz appears to favor McConnell s account on the basis that his account has  matched accounts from law enforcement sources.  McConnell issued his version of events after being released from law enforcement custody, where he spoke for 2 hours with federal agents.Tabloid news site Raw Story also ran with a similar narrative with a deceptive headline that read  Eyewitnesses knock down conspiracy theories about LaVoy Finicum , referring to secondhand accounts by McConnell and colleague, Melvin Lee.As it turns out, Mark McConnell did not actually see the shooting, and instead had  pieced together  his account, as evidenced by his own statement later posted online: going off of what Shawna Cox and Ryan Payne were saying, which were in the vehicle, um, Visually, I seen the truck take off, you know, now any time someone takes off in a vehicle away from law enforcement after they exercise a stop, it s typically considered an act of aggression and foolish. Payne said while they were sitting there and they were clearing my vehicle that him and LeVoy had a heated discussion but he took off they had to chase him, and from what Shawna Cox was saying  from inside of his truck that when he exited the vehicle  he charged after law enforcement . What I do know to be true, from what Payne said and what Shawna said taken pieces here and pieces there and from what I witnessed, um, I didn t see the shooting, um, he was not on his knees, he was not, none of that non sense, that was a miscommunication on somebody else s part but he went after em, he charged em. Here, McConnell is, in effect, issuing a proxy statement on behalf of Victoria Sharp s fellow passengers, Shawn Cox and Ryan Payne. This is hardly admissible, as both Cox and Payne are currently in federal custody and are not able to verify the accuracy of McConnell reiteration. And yet, mainstream media outlets are propping-up McConnell s account, while minimizing Sharp s.After speculating about the shooting, McConnell then says,   I didn t see it, and I m not going to speculate on it. McConnell is said to have been driving in the rear vehicle with Ammon Bundy and his private security, Brian Cavalier.SEE ALSO: Activists or Terrorist? The Truth About the Oregon StandoffUPDATE 1-28-2016: On Wednesday evening, CNN International released a report based on an  anonymous government source  claiming that Finicum was killed by federal agents because he was  reaching towards his waistband.  The Washington Post then re-spun the story, and rather incredibly   is relying on the very same secondhand story presented by Mark McConnell, in a desperate attempt to prop-up the government s version of events: In the moments before he was shot by authorities Tuesday afternoon, Finicum led a high-speed getaway attempt. He then reached for his waistband, prompting authorities to open fire, according to a CNN report.The report, which cites anonymous law enforcement officials but has not been confirmed by The Washington Post, is corroborated by a statement from an occupier who said he was traveling with Finicum at the time of the traffic stop. The fact the media have chosen to label this incident as a  traffic stop  indicates an obvious agenda designed to minimize the obvious   that this was a pre-planned, elaborate ambush by the FBI and Oregon State Police.This same unnamed  source  cited by CNN is also told the network that the incident was indeed captured on video by the FBI, but that authorities  have not decided whether or not the release the video.  (see more breaking updates on this development below)See a full breakdown CNN, Washington Post and the government narrative here.Federal EscalationThis shocking turn of events comes just days after Oregon governor Kate Brown issued what some might consider to be a veiled threat to the protesters and militia, saying that the federal government  must move quickly to end the occupation and hold all of the wrongdoers accountable. Reports last week indicated that the governor had personally written the White House and President Obama, which specifically addressed Attorney General Loretta Lynch and FBI director James Comey, in which Brown expressed her outrage that Harney County and the state of Oregon was not being recognized for its  collaborative achievements , but rather for  outsiders seeking to exploit and manipulate a local matter for their own agenda. According to the FBI s press release, arrested individuals include:Ammon Edward Bundy, 40, of Emmett, Idaho Ryan C. Bundy, 43, of Bunkerville, Nevada Brian Cavalier, 44, of Bunkerville, Nevada Shawna Cox, 59, of Kanab, Utah Ryan Waylen Payne, 32, of Anaconda, Montana Joseph Donald O Shaughnessy, 45, of Cottonwood, ArizonaAfter the federal operation on Highway 395, in a separate incident back at the Wildlife Refuge, YouTube and internet radio personality, Peter Santilli, 50, of Cincinnati, Ohio, approached the venue and walked towards federal agents before being taken into custody.BREAKING: Booking photos of Ammon Bundy, 7 others after arrest near Burns. https://t.co/AcqRyP4pd5 #KOIN6News pic.twitter.com/un82wepf95  Brent Weisberg (@BrentKOIN) January 27, 2016Those still in detention are scheduled to be arraigned at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Portland.According to reports, FBI agents in Phoenix also  made a probable cause arrest of Jon Eric Ritzheimer, age 32, on a federal charge related to the armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Harney County, Oregon. Jon Ritzheimer, another controversial YouTube personality and former US Marine, appears to have left the Malheur Refuge right before the federal operation to apprehend the protesters, when he returned to his home in Peoria, Arizona.Back at the Refuge protest site, the FBI are said to be negotiating with remaining 8 to 10 occupiers inside, with reports that most women and minors have already left the site.Three weeks ago, Finicum, who become the protest s media spokesperson, made a prophetic statement on camera saying that,  There are things more important than your life, and freedom is one of them.  Watch:UPDATE 1-28-2016: Any public distrust or skepticism of the federal authorities would immediately be dispelled by speed release of all video footage (with dozens of agents and surveillance, there should have been more than one video feed taken, including body and gun sight cameras) of the event. Whether or not, and how fast this will happen remains to be seen.UPDATE 1-29-2016 at 01:30PM ET: Due to public pressure and intense speculation about the events of Tuesday evening, and also because of the YouTube recording of eye witness 18 yr old Victoria Sharp, the FBI has released the unedited aerial video footage from Tuesday evening s incident which took place along Highway 395 here. According to the official FBI statement:  We feel that it is necessary to show the whole thing unedited in the interest of transparency.  The FBI video entitled,  Complete, Unedited Video of Joint FBI and OSP Operation 01/26/2016 , does show the victim Lavoy Finicum exiting the truck awkwardly in at least two feet of snow, and he clearly does not  charge towards  the SWAT team, and his hands are clearly held high above his head as he exits his truck when confronted by a SWAT team, before being shot multiple times by marksmen and falling in the snow. Also, the scale and size of this operation is very evident by the footage, and the apprehension of the protesters was not the result of a mere  traffic stop  as erroneously characterized in multiple mainstream media reports. On its own, this FBI drone footage would appear to support previous government and media claims by CNN, Washington Post and others that the victim was indeed  reaching towards his waistband  which gave federal and state police justification to unleash deadly force. However, it is still not completely clear from this aerial footage whether or not Finicum was holstered (he is said to normally carry a gun on the right hip, but FBI are claiming he had a 9mm gun in his inside left breast pocket), but also whether or not he lowered his arms before, or after he was shot multiple times. For example, if Finicum had his hands in the air and was then was shot in the abdomen first, then any man s natural reaction would be to then lower his hand(s) and clutch the wound. Additionally, if any shots were fired, even in the vicinity, then confusion could have ensued which might have prompted Finicum to reach for his weapon. Either way, it is impossible to make any such a forensic determination without a corresponding audio track  which would help to determine if any shots were fired before Finicum s hand(s) could be seen lowering.

23465,‘There’ll be boots on the ground’: US making noises about ‘doing more’ in Syria and Iraq,"21st Century Wire says Various parties in Washington are quietly laying down the rhetorical tarmac for an increased US military operation in Syria.Recent remarks by US Secretary of Defense Ash Carter (see report below) in Davos appear to dovetail with similar words yesterday from US Vice President Joe Biden who stated,  We are prepared to have a military solution for this operation, and taking out Daesh (ISIS). The following was reported by Press TV yesterday, but as yet, we cannot corroborate the story: The United States denies its special operations troops have taken over an airfield in northeastern Syria, near the country s border with Iraq and Turkey. A spokesman of the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) said Friday that the military  denied that US forces have taken control of any airfield in Syria . However, a spokesperson for the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) told Al Jazeera earlier this week that the US special operations forces had taken over the airfield near the city of Rmeilan in Syria s Hasakah province to support Kurdish fighters against the Daesh (ISIL) Takfiri group. Regardless, don t think for one second that the Pentagon doesn t already have some boots on the ground inside Syria  DELTA FORCE: According to a report at Friends of Syria, US Delta Force units are already on the ground in southern Syria near Jordanian border (Image Source: South Front)RTSecretary of Defense Ash Carter has reiterated US plans to increase its military presence in the campaign to retake Mosul and Raqqa from Islamic State, but urged other members of its coalition   like Turkey   to contribute more to the war effort. We re looking for opportunities to do more, and there will be boots on the ground   I want to be clear about that   but it s a strategic question, whether you are enabling local forces to take and hold, rather than trying to substitute for them,  Carter told CNBC from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. I don t think we or anybody else can substitute for them, but there s a lot we can do to enable them, including being on the ground with them.

23467,Oregon Governor Says Feds ‘Must Act’ Against Protesters and Armed Groups in Burns,"21st Century Wire says So far, after nearly 20 days of protests near Burns, Oregon, there s been no one hurt or injured, but it seems the state s chief executive is keen to change that result.According to reports today, Oregon Governor Kate Brown told a news conference hat federal officials,  must move quickly to end the occupation and hold all of the wrongdoers accountable. The governor does not appear at all concerned with the Hammond family s plight, nor with any of this story s core issues like legal minimum sentencing, jury nullification, or private, state and federal land rights   and yet, seems to want an armed confrontation in her state   and not with any of her own state or county law enforcement agents, but by using federal agents instead. PLEADING TO FEDS: Oregon governor Kate Brown.She added,  Residents of Harney County have been overlooked and underserved by federal officials  response thus far. I have conveyed these very grave concerns directly to our leaders at the highest levels of our government: the U.S. Department of Justice and the White House. The Democratic governor also claims that the protest has cost the state over $500,000 over the last 3 weeks.  We ll be asking federal officials to reimburse the state for these costs. It s not clear exactly how she arrived at that figure, but it can t be from calculating Harney County sheriff s deputies overtime pay.Harney County Judge Steve Grasty also voice a desire to see federal agents take a more aggressive approach towards Ammon Bundy and his fellow protesters, saying,  I hope they lock it down.

23470,"Arizona Rancher Protesting in Oregon is Targeted by CPS, Loses Custody of Foster Children","RTOne of the most visible members of the armed militia that took over a wildlife refuge in Oregon says his four foster sons were taken away due to his involvement in the standoff, and he blames the federal government who  must have gotten to the governor. Robert  LaVoy  Finicum and his wife Jeanette have fostered more than 50 boys over the last decade at their ranch near Chino Valley, Arizona. The couple is licensed and has a care contract with the Catholic Charities Community Services. Many of the children came from mental hospitals, drug rehabs and group homes for emotionally distressed youth, he told Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB). IMAGE: Robert  LaVoy  Finicum. My ranch has been a great tool for these boys,  Finicum said.  It has done a lot of good. He traveled to Oregon to take part in the takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge at the beginning of January, leaving Jeanette to care for the four boys. But now the Finicums have no more fosters to care for.A social worker began removing the last four of the family s foster kids on January 4, the fourth day of the Oregon standoff. The last left five days later, he said. They didn t go out at the same time,  Finicum said.  One was there for a year, one of the boys was there six months, another eight months, and a month. I don t know where they ended up. He blamed the kids  removals on pressure from the feds. They were ripped from my wife,  Finicum said.  We are very successful [foster parents]. Our track records are good, it s been a good relationship. [Federal authorities] must have gotten to the governor, who told the state to get them out of there.

23472,#Hashtag Hell & The Fake Left," By Dady Chery and Gilbert MercierAll writers with a desire to rattle people out of their torpor occasionally wonder if it is worthwhile to continue to try to raise their voices over the din of lies and distractions.More and more for us, such thoughts are occasioned, not by the mainstream, which predictably treats all the pronouncements from the powerful as being newsworthy, but by the fake left, which lobotomizes most of whom it touches. The increasing sophistication of this group and its rate of expansion are astounding. Its purpose is to annihilate and replace the real left, and it is making great strides in this regard.The real left includes those who, like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK), came to realize that quantum leaps are the way to proceed, rather than tiny incremental change. The real left does not curry favor or approval from those in power; it challenges the social status quo and respects the inherent right of an injured and indignant population to rebel against authority. It is not for rent or for sale, and it does not cave in to power. Martin Luther King March (Image Source: Wikicommons)By contrast, the motivations of the fake left are money and fame: the preservation of their place in their ivory towers, together with all the trimmings of an upper middle class or wealthy lifestyle. For them, the path is smoothed and the wheels of the machine are oiled for lucrative book deals, speaking tours, radio and television interviews, and articles that are infinitely reverberated through approved sites in the Internet. Their spokespeople channel political ideas toward electoral cycles and transform revolutionary musings into banalities, paralysis, and futile actions. They attack the public s thought process itself and engender an attention-deficit disorder. Ideas are not pursued, shared, honed, and acted upon but instead displaced by fleeting slogans like  hope and change,  or  feel the Bern. Alternatively, the ideas are muddled, branded and labeled with names like  shock doctrine,   disaster capitalism,  or  climate capitalism,  so that they may be put away and no longer examined. An important function of the fake left is to diffuse legitimate, spontaneous defense. Righteous anger is made to give way to confusion, and the impetus to revolt is transformed into the futility of virtual actions. Slogans are used as vaccines to prevent the contagion of dissent. Thoughts, not quite fully formed and the beginning of spontaneous actions, like blockage of bridges and highways, quickly dissipate. They are aborted into quick visual scans of an image or rapidly associated with a few words, like  black lives matter,  and then shared on social media. Today, Thomas Paine s Common Sense would not kindle a revolution; instead it would be quoted, posted, pinned, and tweeted. The fake left is a decoy: a hunter s trap to break the leg of any possible revolution. One of the fake left s godfathers is the multibillionaire George Soros, who obviously believes that wealth equals wisdom and has come up with a clever model to launder his vast financial gains into global political influence. Soros has developed an extremely diversified portfolio of intellectual properties and non-governmental organizations (NGO) in more than 37 countries. Artists throughout the world who present their people as victims, and promote passivity and despair, are rewarded with support and prestigious prizes. Supported organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are accused not only of selectively collecting data on human rights abuses but also of exploiting some of those data to pressure countries into policy changes that are unrelated to human rights. Independent  journalism is a major focus of Soros  Open Society Foundation, which was founded in 1993, soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union and right before the explosion of the Internet. When US-friendly corrupt governments, and US-sponsored institutions like USAID and the United Nations are exposed by the real left, Soros-sponsored think tanks and news organizations like the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) spring into action and become the voice of reason, demanding that these organizations self-reform. Countless others, also related to the Open Society Foundation, echo and amplify their message. Dismantlement and profound systemic change are never on the agenda. In most of the world, and especially the US, elections are staged, with the primary goal being to let off steam from targeted sectors of the population. A secondary goal is to make a rigged political process appear believable and give the impression of a free exchange of ideas. The candidates are presented as caricatures that trigger an emotional identification in specific groups of people. In the US in 2016, the mean, misogynist and racist ugly American stereotype is served well by Donald Trump for the right. On the other side, the reincarnated Occupy leftist champion of social justice is played by Bernie Sanders. Nonetheless it is Hillary Clinton s turn to win. Trump and Sanders serve to keep the elections in the news and to make Clinton the only supposed pragmatic choice. The ambition of Sanders to beat Hillary Clinton is questionable in light of the fact that he did not run for the presidency in 2012, although the issues were the same, and he could have benefited then from the energy of Occupy. Sander s platform is a reactivation of the Occupy themes. Occupy, however, is not what it used to be. Indeed it is a perfect example of something from the real left that was hijacked. It began as a leaderless anti-capitalist movement called US Day of Rage, but soon it acquired leaders like Chris Hedges, and its most radical elements, like the Black Bloc anarchists, were vilified and excluded. The fake left poaches the narrative of the real left so as to kill it. Outright plagiarism and abundant appropriations and rewrites are hallmarks of the fake left.  Since it lacks a heartfelt leftist rhetoric, it must continually borrow one, ironically, to excoriate it so as to present a superficial version of it. Any critical examination will show that the self-proclaimed firebrands of the left have, for decades, never moved the revolutionary dial an iota. If books like Noam Chomsky s Occupy or Naomi Klein s Shock Doctrine, or Chris Hedges and Joe Sacco s Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt had been genuine, they would have brought people to the barricades in the streets, and there would surely have been attempts to suppress them. Instead the books have been celebrated and glorified by the media establishment, because these pseudo-radical manifestos have not brought action but paralysis.The latest offering by Naomi Klein, This Changes Everything, will, by design, change absolutely nothing at all, except the balance of her bank account. TOAST OF THE LEFT: Author Naomi Klein.Those few of us who are genuinely trying to change the course of events sometimes wonder how we can compete against this powerful new machine that appropriates our message, twists it, and then blasts a degraded version of it through countless bullhorns. Doesn t the public realize that wealth and fame are not the normal trappings of revolutionaries? Don t people know that revolution is never easy, and that if it appears to be, it is not real? If words like earth, nature, life, democracy, dissent, protest, love, and revolution are allowed to lose their weight, our voices will go the way of the song of the extinct Dodo bird. It is imperative that these words be reappropriated and reinfused with meaning.Revolutionary talk cannot be permitted to become an exercise in futile venting or a validation of passivity; to mean anything at all, it must be enacted in community.Dady Chery is the author of We Have Dared to Be Free, and Gilbert Mercier is the author of The Orwellian Empire.

23473,Astroturfing: Journalist Reveals Brainwashing Tactic Uses to Manipulate Public Opinion,"Vic Bishop Waking TimesOur reality is carefully constructed by powerful corporate, political and special interest sources in order to covertly sway public opinion. Blatant lies are often televised regarding terrorism, food, war, health, etc. They are fashioned to sway public opinion and condition viewers to accept what have become destructive societal norms.The practice of manipulating and controlling public opinion with distorted media messages has become so common that there is a whole industry formed around this. The entire role of this brainwashing industry is to figure out how to spin information to journalists, similar to the lobbying of government. It is never really clear just how much truth the journalists receive because the news industry has become complacent. The messages that it presents are shaped by corporate powers who often spend millions on advertising with the six conglomerates that own 90% of the media:General Electric (GE), News-Corp, Disney, Viacom, Time Warner, and CBS. Yet, these corporations function under many different brands, such as FOX, ABC, CNN, Comcast, Wall Street Journal, etc, giving people the perception of choice   As Tavistock s researchers showed, it was important that the victims of mass brainwashing not be aware that their environment was being controlled; there should thus be a vast number of sources for information, whose messages could be varied slightly, so as to mask the sense of external control. ~ Specialist of mass brainwashing, L. WolfeNew Brainwashing Tactic Called AstroturfWith alternative media on the rise, the propaganda machine continues to expand. Below is a video of Sharyl Attkisson, investigative reporter with CBS, during which she explains how  astroturf,  or fake grassroots movements, are used to spin information not only to influence journalists but to sway public opinion. Astroturf is a perversion of grassroots. Astroturf is when political, corporate or other special interests disguise themselves and publish blogs, start facebook and twitter accounts, publish ads, letters to the editor, or simply post comments online, to try to fool you into thinking an independent or grassroots movement is speaking. ~ Sharyl Attkisson, Investigative ReporterHow do you separate fact from fiction? Sharyl Attkisson finishes her talk with some insights on how to identify signs of propaganda and astroturfing  These methods are used to give people the impression that there is widespread support for an agenda, when, in reality, one may not exist. Astroturf tactics are also used to discredit or criticize those that disagree with certain agendas, using stereotypical names such as conspiracy theorist or quack. When in fact when someone dares to reveal the truth or questions the  official  story, it should spark a deeper curiosity and encourage further scrutiny of the information.This article (Journalist Reveals Tactics Brainwashing Industry Uses to Manipulate the Public) was originally created and published by Waking Times and is published here under a Creative Commons license with attribution to Vic Bishop and WakingTimes.com.

23474,The New American Century: An Era of Fraud,"Paul Craig RobertsIn the last years of the 20th century fraud entered US foreign policy in a new way.  On false pretenses Washington dismantled Yugoslavia and Serbia in order to advance an undeclared agenda. In the 21st century this fraud multiplied many times. Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, and Libya were destroyed, and Iran and Syria would also have been destroyed if the President of Russia had not prevented it.  Washington is also behind the current destruction of Yemen, and Washington has enabled and financed the Israeli destruction of Palestine.  Additionally, Washington operated militarily within Pakistan without declaring war, murdering many women, children, and village elders under the guise of  combating terrorism.  Washington s war crimes rival those of any country in history.I have documented these crimes in my columns and books (Clarity Press). Anyone who still believes in the purity of Washington s foreign policy is a lost soul  Russia and China now have a strategic alliance that is too strong for Washington. Russia and China will prevent Washington from further encroachments on their security and national interests. Those countries important to Russia and China will be protected by the alliance.  As the world wakes up and sees the evil that the West represents, more countries will seek the protection of Russia and China.America is also failing on the economic front.  My columns and my book, The Failure of Laissez Faire Capitalism, which has been published in English, Chinese, Korean, Czech, and German, have shown how Washington has stood aside, indeed cheering it on, while the short-term profit interests of management, shareholders, and Wall Street eviscerated the American economy, sending manufacturing jobs, business know-how, and technology, along with professional tradeable skill jobs, to China, India, and other countries, leaving America with such a hollowed out economy that the median family income has been falling for years. Today 50% of 25 year-old Americans are living with their parents or grandparents because they cannot find employment sufficient to sustain an independent existance.This brutal fact is covered up by the presstitute US media, a source of fantasy stories of America s economic recovery.The facts of our existence are so different from what is reported that I am astonished. As a former professor of economics, Wall Street Journal editor and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy, I am astonished at the corruption that rules in the financial sector, the Treasury, the financial regulatory agencies, and the Federal Reserve.  In my day, there would have been indictments and prison sentences of bankers and high government officials.In America today there are no free financial markets.  All the markets are rigged by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. The regulatory agencies, controlled by those the agencies are supposed to regulate, turn a blind eye, and even if they did not, they are helpless to enforce any law, because private interests are more powerful than the law.Even the government s statistical agencies have been corrupted. Inflation measures have been concocted in order to understate inflation. This lie not only saves Washington from paying Social Security cost-of-living adjustments and frees the money for more wars, but also by understating inflation, the government can create real GDP growth by counting inflation as real growth, just as the government creates 5% unemployment by not counting any discouraged workers who have looked for jobs until they can no longer afford the cost of looking and give up.  The official unemployment rate is 5%, but no one can find a job.  How can the unemployment rate be 5% when half of 25-year olds are living with relatives because they cannot afford an independent existence?  As John Williams (shadowfacts) reports, the unemployment rate that includes those Americans who have given up looking for a job because there are no jobs to be found is 23%.The Federal Reserve, a tool of a small handful of banks, has succeeded in creating the illusion of an economic recovery since June, 2009, by printing trillions of dollars that found their way not into the economy but into the prices of financial assets.  Artificially booming stock and bond markets are the presstitute financial media s  proof  of a booming economy.The handful of learned people that America has left, and it is only a small handful, understand that there has been no recovery from the previous recession and that a new downturn is upon us.  John Williams has pointed out that US industrial production, when properly adjusted for inflation, has never recovered its 2008 level, much less its 2000 peak, and has again turned down.The American consumer is exhausted, overwhelmed by debt and lack of income growth. The entire economic policy of America is focused on saving a handful of NY banks, not on saving the American economy.Economists and other Wall Street shills will dismiss the decline in industrial production as America is now a service economy. Economists pretend that these are high-tech services of the New Economy, but in fact waitresses, bartenders, part time retail clerks, and ambulatory health care services have replaced manufacturing and engineering jobs at a fraction of the pay, thus collapsing effective aggregate demand in the US. On occasions when neoliberal economists recognize problems, they blame them on China.It is unclear that the US economy can be revived. To revive the US economy would require the re-regulation of the financial system and the recall of the jobs and US GDP that offshoring gave to foreign countries. It would require, as Michael Hudson demonstrates in his new book, Killing the Host, a revolution in tax policy that would prevent the financial sector from extracting economic surplus and capitalizing it in debt obligations paying interest to the financial sector.The US government, controlled as it is by corrupt economic interests, would never permit policies that impinged on executive bonuses and Wall Street profits.  Today US capitalism makes its money by selling out the American economy and the people dependent upon it.In  freedom and democracy  America, the government and the economy serve interests totally removed from the interests of the American people. The sellout of the American people is protected by a huge canopy of propaganda provided by free market economists and financial presstitutes paid to lie for their living.When America fails, so will Washington s vassal states in Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan.  Unless Washington destroys the world in nuclear war, the world will be remade, and the corrupt and dissolute West will be an insignificant part of the new world.Dr. Paul Craig Roberts was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy and associate editor of the Wall Street Journal.

23475,Hillary Clinton: ‘Israel First’ (and no peace for Middle East),"Robert Fantina CounterpunchAlthough the United States is still ten months from its next exercise in electoral futility, most polls do not indicate what former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is most anxious to see: a runaway victory for her candidacy. It is a good sign that, despite the fact that she has no real contrasting opponent on the Democratic side, the coronation she expected isn t going to happen.One might say that this writer focuses too much on Mrs. Clinton s adoration of Israel. But by looking at her comments about that apartheid nation, one gets a clear view of some broader, very troubling perspectives that Mrs. Clinton seems to hold.On January 6, an opinion piece appeared in The Jewish Journal, written by Mrs. Clinton. It is a fawning, maudlin essay, typical of the writing of anyone seeking national political office in the U.S. who knows they must pay homage to their Israeli lord and master. A few points from this essay tell much about Mrs. Clinton. I m especially concerned about the new wave of violence inside Israel itself   brutal stabbings, shootings, and vehicle attacks that seek to sow fear among the innocent. The number of Palestinians killed in the West Bank alone by settler and IOF (Israel Occupation Force) terrorists is at a ten-year high. Why is Mrs. Clinton not  especially concerned  about the continuing wave of violence against Palestinians, in an area that even the U.S. says Israel occupies illegally? Do not these vicious attacks  seek to sow fear among the innocent ? Only a two-state solution negotiated between the parties can provide Palestinians independence, sovereignty, and dignity, and provide Israelis the secure and recognized borders of a democratic Jewish state. Why, oh why, does Mrs. Clinton continue to make this ridiculous statement? The borders of the Jewish state are recognized by most of the world, including the United Nations, and consist of those determined prior to 1967. There is nothing to negotiate. Does Mrs. Clinton disdain international law? It appears that she feels Israel, like the U.S. in its international dealings, is, indeed, above the law. BIBI FIRST: Hillary Clinton will never tell Israel  no .And this writer must point out, once again, that negotiations, which have proceeded on and off for twenty years or so, can only be effective when each side wants something the other has, that it can only obtain by surrendering something it has. Israel wants all of Palestine, and takes it, piece by piece, with complete impunity. Why should Palestine agree to pointless negotiations?Mrs. Clinton refers to the  secure and recognized  borders of a Jewish state, but does not seem to consider the  secure and recognized  borders of a Palestinian state. We must continue to fight against global efforts to delegitimize Israel. The Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, known as BDS, is the latest front in this battle. BDS demonizes Israeli scientists and intellectuals even young students and compares Israel to South African apartheid.  That s wrong and this campaign should end. The most significant efforts to delegitimize Israel are made by Israel itself. Its racist society, wherein Israeli Jews have more rights than anyone else in Israel; its apartheid system of segregation; its complete disdain for the human rights of the Palestinians; the racist, murderous statements made by government officials all further delegitimize the country, and demonize it, and rightly so. Israel is often compared to South African apartheid, and the comparison is valid.And it is not just in the context of Palestine and Israel that Mrs. Clinton demonstrates either gross ignorance, or gross dishonesty. Her essay also contained these pearls of wisdom: We must work with our friends and partners to deny ISIS territory in the Middle East, dismantle the global infrastructure of terror, and toughen our defenses at home.  We can t just contain ISIS   we must defeat ISIS. Is that really the U.S. s goal? Garikai Chengu, a researcher at Harvard University, suggested in September of 2014 that ISIS  is made-in-the-USA, an instrument of terror designed to divide and conquer the oil-rich Middle East and to counter Iran s growing influence in the region. In a June, 2015 column in The Guardian, Associate Editor Seumas Milne said this:  [T]he U.S. and its allies weren t only supporting and arming an opposition they knew to be dominated by extreme sectarian groups; they were prepared to countenance the creation of some sort of  Islamic state    despite the  grave danger  to Iraq s unity   as a Sunni buffer to weaken Syria.

23476,McPain: John McCain Furious That Iran Treated US Sailors Well,"21st Century Wire says As 21WIRE reported earlier this week, the unlikely  mishap  of two US Naval vessels straying into Iranian waters   just hours before the President s State of the Union speech, followed by the usual parade of arch-neocons coming on TV in real time to declare the incident as  an act of aggression  by Iran against the United States   is no mere coincidence.24 hours after the incident, the Iranians returned all 11 US sailors, unharmed and in good spirits. The only remaining casualty from this event was an incident of a common condition in Washington known as  Pre-Traumatic Stress Disorder    suffered by a certain US Senator was mortified by the uneventful outcome which followed Daniel McAdams Ron Paul Institute  The two US Navy riverine command boats intercepted in Iranian territorial waters yesterday were sent on their way along with the crew of 10 US sailors after brief detention on Iranian soil.According to news reports, the well-armed warships either suffered mechanical or navigational difficulties which caused them to enter Iranian territory (although it may well have been a game of cat-and-mouse to test the Iranian response). The US sailors were apparently treated well, enjoyed what appeared a decent meal in relaxed surroundings, and in the end apologized for the mistake and praised their treatment by the Iranians. Thanks to President Obama s policy shift on Iran toward engagement and away from isolationism, Secretary of State John Kerry was able to telephone his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Zarif and quickly defuse what just months ago would have been a far more serious situation.This should be a good-news story about the value of diplomacy and reducing tensions with adversaries, but Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) was having none of it. That Kerry expressed his appreciation to the Iranians for swiftly releasing the American sailors only showed the Obama Administration s  craven desire to preserve the dangerous Iranian nuclear deal at all costs evidently knows no limit,  said McCain in a press release.McCain was furious that  Obama administration officials seem to be falling over themselves to offer praise for Iran s graciousness  and was outraged that the Iranians dared interfere with the actions of US military vessels operating in Iranian waters.In the world of John McCain, only the United States has the right to national sovereignty. The US military has the right to act anywhere and everywhere and the rest of the world dare not raise a question.According to McCain,  sovereign immune naval vessels are exempt from detention, boarding, or search. Their crews are not subject to detention or arrest. Imagine the tune McCain would have been singing if a well-armed Iranian naval vessel had been spotted in US territorial waters off the coast of New York. Would he have so rigorously condemned any US interference in the actions of Iran s sovereign naval vessels?Leave it to some clever Twitterers to post an example of the difference between US and Iranian detention.Copyright   2016 by RonPaul Institute.

23477,"JUSTICE? Yahoo Settles E-mail Privacy Class-action: $4M for Lawyers, $0 for Users","21st Century Wire says It s a familiar theme. Whenever there is a dispute or a change of law, and two tribes go to war, there is normally only one real winner after the tribulation  the lawyers. Ars TechnicaIn late 2013, Yahoo was hit with six lawsuits over its practice of using automated scans of e-mail to produce targeted ads. The cases, which were consolidated in federal court, all argued that the privacy rights of non-Yahoo users, who  did not consent to Yahoo s interception and scanning of their emails,  were being violated by a multi-billion dollar company.Now, lawyers representing the plaintiffs are singing a different tune. Last week, they asked US District Judge Lucy Koh to accept a proposed settlement (PDF). Under the proposal, the massive class of non-Yahoo users won t get any payment, but the class lawyers at Girard Gibbs and Kaplan Fox intend to ask for up to $4 million in fees. (The ultimate amount of fees will be up to the judge, but Yahoo has agreed not to oppose any fee request up to $4 million.)While users won t get any payment, Yahoo will change how it handles user e-mails but it isn t the change that the plaintiffs attorneys were originally asking for. Yahoo won t stop scanning e-mails. Instead, the company has agreed to make a technical change to when it scans e-mails. In the settlement (PDF), Yahoo has agreed that e-mail content will be  only sent to servers for analysis for advertising purposes after a Yahoo Mail user can access the email in his or her inbox.

23478,Sunnistan: US and Allied ‘Safe Zone’ Plan to Take Territorial Booty in Northern Syria,"Patrick Henningsen  21st Century WireRemember when the Obama Administration told the world how it hoped to identify 5,000 reliable non-jihadist  moderate  rebels hanging out in Turkey and Jordan, who might want to fight for Washington in Syria? After all the drama over its infamous  train and equip  program to create their own Arab army in Syria, they want to give it another try.This week, Pentagon officials announced their new plan to train up to 7,000 more  moderate  fighters, but this time the project would take place inside Syria (and to hell with international law).We re told that this was requested by Ankara, and with all NATO allies singing the same hymn   claiming that this new effort will help in securing Turkey s porous border with Syria, or so the story goes. Washington s political cover for this is fashioned from the popular post-Paris theme: to protect civilized Europe from invading hordes and the terrorists who hide among them, as stated in the Wall Street Journal: The program would address part of the tense and long-running dialogue between Washington and Ankara over sealing the border, which Western governments have long complained is an avenue for extremists to leave Syria and travel internationally, The timing of this announcement seemed uncanny against the backdrop of an unlikely ISIS  suicide bomb  terrorist attack, in Turkey, of all places, where the victims just happened to be 14 German tourists, feeding perfectly into Europe s new binary fear set of terrorism and immigration. Shades of GLADIO, undoubtedly (but you won t see western journalists entertaining such conspiracy theories).Our friends at Nation Builders Inc are banking on the global public suffering from Syria fatigue, but now is the time to really pay attention. The west s real agenda for the region is starting to unfold Despite all of US-led Coalition s scandals, lies, epic failures, false flags and official conspiracy theories, the mainstream narrative on Syria persists. It s on our TV screens and in our newspapers constantly   from Los Angeles to London, from Paris to Riyadh, every politician and pundit seems to have an opinion about,  what to do with Syria?  Everyone, except the Syria people  themselves, who like the people of Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Yemen and ever other country that s found itself under the cleaver of western interests   are never afforded any say in their own destiny. As is tradition in Washington, London and Paris, the only Syrian voices which count are the ones who have been hand-picked by western technocrats and approved by the Saudi royal family to form their ever-changing  recognized  government-in-exile, the Syrian National Council. Currently, that could be Riad Hijab,  George Sabra or Khaled Khoja. Next week, it could be three others, depending on who has fallen in, or out of favor with Washington or Riyadh.To anyone who was listening close enough early on in the conflict, you would have heard determined members of the western-backed  Syrian Opposition  admitting how they would,  make a deal with the devil if that s what it takes to win power.  Four years later, we now see that is exactly what happened, but whether you believe that this  devil is US-led Coalition, or terrorist armies fighting groups (or both) might be cause for debate. Others will argue over which is the bigger devil   is it the Wahabist-Salafist terrorist brigades like al Nusra Front and Islamic State, or is it the West and its GCC partners?The unfortunate reality is that these two devils are not mutually exclusive. The West and its partners not only created this  terror  crisis, but did so with the intent of unveiling a grand  solution  to the problem.Plans A-ZThe terrorist enclave in Syria is designed for purpose   to implant a hostile metastasis right in the middle of the very territory which neocolonial powers plan to tear away from the barely sovereign nations of Iraq and Syria.Since 2011, the western-led cartel has deployed various levels of international subterfuge in Syria, starting with Plan A: the Arab Spring method   igniting a popular street uprising that might capture the world s attention for 15 minutes   enough to generate some high-quality evocative imagery and a social media storm to carry memes of liberty around the globe, inspiring the people on the streets (and on Twitter) to demand  change . Their cries for freedom would then be backed up by the US State Department, along with its functionaries at Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International America, and other Open Society Institute-funded NGOs and  human rights  organizations. Obviously, this did not work. Next, Plan B: the political opposition suddenly transcended into an armed, paramilitary opposition, followed by brutal violence and killing on both sides. The US and its allies wasted no time, pledging weapons, training, cash and logistical support to the armed opposition. The west set up its own parallel government for Syria abroad, but it failed to gain any traction with the Syria people. Then came Plan C: this  opposition  would be quickly overrun and absorbed into a massive array of mostly foreign jihadi and mercenary soldiers of misfortune and other assorted terrorists. This fed into an already established  War on Terror  western narrative. Now the west had a familiar entry point into the fight. The Washington-London-Paris-Tel-Aviv-Riyadh-Doha-Ankara Axis hoped that these terrorists would do the job of overthrowing the government of Bashar al Assad in Damascus, and collapse the country into a spirally pit of sectarian and tribal chaos. Who could blame them? After all, it worked in Libya in late 2011.Fast forward to 2016, having failed to overthrow Assad and implode the nation-state of Syria, the men and women of Nation Builders Inc and their muscles in Brussels (NATO), are quickly moving to Plan D: take territory. That s not to say plans A through D weren t always in the schematics   they certainly were, and further back than many people would dare to speculate.We now know from Wikileaks cables that this operation goes back to at least 2006, but in reality, it s probably much earlier than that. Taking the long view of history and the audacious building, and rebuilding, of a Euro-centric empire in the Middle East, one could say the process began the day the Sykes-Picot Agreement was signed in 1916. Concealed between those post-colonial lines drawn exactly 100 years ago, was the latent potential for the very conflicts and uncivil wars we are seeing today. If those borders are redrawn once again, you can be certain that they will be drawn by the very same powers involved a century ago. Whatever the arrangement, it will be to weaken, not strengthen the region, and certainly not strengthen any of the present nation states in the region, especially Syria. Proprietary powers will want any new states to be stuck in a perpetual state of neocolonial dependency, with an emphasis on financial and security dependency.Mice and Men21WIRE was one of the first news sources to warn about Washington s initial impulse back in 2014 when it began calling for a  No Fly Zone  in Northern Syria. It was clear that a problem, reaction, solution dialectic was in play, with ISIS being the object of the public s reaction. That plan might have come to fruition in the fall of 2015, but a funny thing happened on the way to the UN General Assembly in New York City. Later that week, Russia announced that it would be inserting itself, and its Air Force, into the Syrian quagmire, and with that, thwarted any master plan for a US-Turkey (NATO) controlled No Fly Zone along the Turkish-Syrian border. Suffice to say, that Russia already knew NATO s next move and acted accordingly, and with purpose.When asked two days ago about the prospect of the Washington DC latest brainchild, Train and Equip 2.0, this time inside Syria, here were my initial thoughts: We now know why, and it has more to do with what s beneath the sand than what s on top.As any good pirate will tell you   if you want to claim your share of the booty, you have to do your share of the killing. The Truth About  Train and Equip The previous  train and equip  program ended with Washington s military brass paraded in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee, before being roundly lambasted for failing to train even a handful of  moderate rebels , this after being awarded $500 million by the US taxpayer to get er done. When originally announced amid much fanfare, the public were told that the US government, in conjunction with the CIA, would be arming and training  moderate  militants in Turkey, Jordan or at a base in Saudi Arabia   before sending them to fight inside Syria. Washington claims that these new trainees were meant to fight ISIS, and not the Syrian government forces, but judging by the unwavering  regime change  rhetoric from the west, it would be highly naive to think that all this was strictly for ISIS.Nine months into the train and equip project, US Army Gen. Lloyd Austin III, acknowledged in Sept. 2015 that they had only managed to get  four or five  on the battlefield by then. Not one member of the media challenged this statement, probably because most were happy with the answer given   one which gave any hawkish critics of the Obama administration the pound of flesh they wanted and served to only intensify more calls before the new year for US  boots on the ground  in Syria. Doves loved it because it seemed to prove that backing proxies doesn t work, and that the best solution was to call it quits. For the sanguine mainstream media, it served-up that all-too familiar government narrative, of a  cock-up, not a cover-up.  This is the media s natural default position. In other words,  Well, it didn t work out, but that s nothing new with our incompetent government. Nothing to see here, move along.  To ask how the money disappeared, or really inquire into how it costs $500 million to train only five men   apparently was way too much work for the media. Not one  journalist  stopped to ask, if only 5 fighters were trained and dispatched, then what happened to the half a billion dollars?The real answer to that question should be self-evident to anyone studying reports on the ground in Syria, and is way too uncomfortable for the US media to stomach   that the US  train and equip  program provided the necessary official cover to allow the prosecution of a dirty war under the table. It wasn t a failure like fall guy Gen. Lloyd Austin will have you believe, it was a success.Judging by the proliferation of heavy weaponry and other lethal arms that have made it into the hands of al Qaeda in Syria (al Nusra Front), ISIS, Jaysh al Islam and others   it s clear that Uncle Sam s generous donation of $500 million has definitely been used to equip, if not train, those  rebels  in Syria.Middle East commentator and analyst Sharmine Narwani explains the West s perennial dilemma when trying to identify who their  moderates  are in Syria: For years, Washington has insisted there are armed  moderate  groups in Syria, but have gone to great lengths to avoid naming these  moderates.  Why? Because if moderates were named and identified, the US would have to be very, very certain that no past, present or future  atrocity video  would surface to prove otherwise. And the US could not guarantee this with any of the groups they have armed, trained or financed in Syria over the past five years. The next  train and equip  round will be more focused, and will be used to secure the following  The map above is from July 2015, but still represents the current military chessboard in Syria.Safe Zone =  Sunnistan Somehow it feels like 1998 all over again, with bad memories of the KLA in Kosovo, imported jihadist fighters in Bosnia, and NATO lording over a newly balkanized region.When you hear US officials like John McCain or clueless Republican presidential candidates like Marco Rubio or Carly Fiorina, all crowing for a  Safe Zone  in northern Syria, this is what they are referring to (see map above). Their  safe zone  just so happens to be in the exact same area where ISIS is currently holding court. It s a  safe zone  alright, but not for refugees and  Syrians fleeing the evil Bashar al Assad    rather, the  safe zone  will be for an array of  rebel  and terrorist fighters, part of a defacto Sunni state-lette in waiting.So the US-led Coalition s  safe zone  is the very Caliphate that Americans are decrying.For anyone requiring proof that such a grand chessboard is in play in Syria, they need look no further than a set of US airstrikes that took place before Christmas. On December 6, 2015,  US fighter bombers struck a Syrian military base located in the village of Ayyash in Deir Ezzor Province, east of Raqqa, which killed 3 Syrian Arab Army (SAA) soldiers and wounded additional others. Naturally, the Pentagon swiftly denied that any such attack took place. What happened after this incident was extremely telling, as explained by global affairs analyst Mike Whitney from Counterpunch Magazine: It s also worth noting, that according to South Front military analysis, the US bombing raid coincided with a  a full-scale ISIS offensive on the villages of Ayyash and Bgelia.  In other words, the US attack provided sufficient air-cover for ISIS terrorists to carry out their ground operations. Was that part of the plan or was it merely a coincidence? So the US air force was coordinating with ISIS boots on the ground, to achieve a common military objective. But it didn t end there. Less than 24 hours after the attack, US warplanes bombed the village of Al-Khan in north-eastern Syria killing 26 Syrian civilians including at least four women and seven children and four women. The message the US military is sending with these lethal attacks is that it wants to control the air-space over east Syria where it plans to remove ISIS and establish a de facto Sunni state consistent with its scheme to break Syria and Iraq into smaller cantons governed by local warlords, Islamic fanatics, and US puppets. Also taking place at the same moment on Dec 6th, was Turkey s quiet little invasion into northern Iraq, sending hundreds of troops and at least 20 tanks into territory north of Mosul, right between the Kurds and ISIS. It should be noted that this illegal incursion by NATO member Turkey was not approved by the Iraqi government in Baghdad, and Iraqi PM Haider al-Abadi called for Turkey to  immediately withdraw its troops.  Judging by Washington s silence on the matter, it s obvious that the US gave Turkey its full blessing. Here, Zero Hedge astutely points out the obvious: Most importantly of all, right on what Al-Araby al-Jadeed claims is the smuggling route for illegal ISIS crude into Turkey from Iraq.  Not surprisingly, Turkey s sudden move also came at the same time that Russia began to publicly expose Turkey s clandestine role in facilitating the ISIS oil trade, as well as launching airstrikes to destroy ISIS oil convoys moving from Syria into Turkey. And then Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdo an (photo, left) places his military assets at the very location where stolen ISIS oil makes its way from Iraq into Turkey? Hardly a coincidence.Make no mistake, both ends of NATO s military axle, the United States and Turkey, along with their Saudi-backed boots on the ground in ISIS and al Nusra   have each made critical strategic moves in unison, and with a specific military purpose each time, nudging towards securing territory. Once each key piece is finally in position, all that is required is a new  crisis , either in the region, or in Europe, or in America   to allow the Axis powers to move in quickly and take what is needed to implement the next phase of the game, whether that s creating a Kurdish canton, or a Sunni state-lette. Such moves will rarely be covered by the western international media.To be perfectly clear, the terms  Sunni  and  Shia  are the favored sectarian lexicon used by Nation Builders Inc and its international partners in Riyadh and Tel Aviv. My intention here is not to reduce the Muslim world down to this paradigm, but the architects of instability will use these terms, over and over   in their attempt to both marginalize and dehumanized Muslims for their own selfish ends.What s the  safe zone  for? As the US-led Coalition steps up its 18 month-long Punch  n Judy air operation to supplant ISIS from Raqqa, those western-backed jihadis will later require a safe corridor to flee but still remain connected to their Turkish supply lines. Washington s  safe zone  would also provide a much-needed safe haven for  rebels  who have been sent packing by the Syrian government from towns like Homs and others, as part of a painstaking disarming and reconciliation process between the Assad government and  opposition  rebels who are willing to participate in the program. Once the NATO-GCC Axis has established a mini protectorate inside of Syria, this will provide everything ISIS, al Nusra, Ahrar al-Sham, Turkmens et all will need; a secure launching pad for incursions further inside Syria   which will certainly guarantee a longer, protracted conflict in Syria   and beyond.This little Sunni wedge is also conveniently located next to a large rebel-terrorist contingent in Syria s northwestern Idlib governorate (province). Syria s border with Turkey has been porous from the beginning of the conflict, so the proposed  safe zone  will allow Turkey to maintain this status quo   where it has been continuously allowing the free-flow of weapons, rebels and terrorist fighters alike, along with oil, narcotics and human trafficking   to move freely through its southern border with Syria.If  regime  change  rhetoric is anything to go by, along with turning a blind eye to NATO member Turkey s role in facilitating supply lines and safe passage for al Qaeda and ISIS, then Washington s agenda is fairly transparent here. If they can establish a  internationally recognized  safe zone and a No-Fly Zone on top of it, central planners believe they will have the platform they need to eventually destroy Damascus, install their own western puppet, and then carve up Syria and northern Iraq accordingly. ISIS RAT-LINES: Black market oil has been a key component to carrying on both conflicts in Syria, and Iraq.For the architects of instability in Washington, one crucial benefit of carving out Sunni territory in both northern and eastern Syria is that available oil will help fund all of their paramilitary and terrorist needs   making it sustainable. To guarantee this uninterrupted income stream from black market oil which is presently making its way out of Syria and into Turkey and via Kurdistan, help is required from the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) and other stakeholders, including the British-Turkish firm Genel Energy, just one firm who is providing the end-run to market for illicit ISIS oil. Ditto for a key mover and shaker in Raqqa s new Rockefeller class, Bilal Erdogan, the son of Turkish president, who according to numerous recent reports has already amassed a small fortune from the lucrative oil-for-terror trade.This is a problem, but one which Washington, London and Paris are not overly concerned with, much less upset about. Iraqi, Kurdish and Turkish opposition officials have accused Turkish governments and the KRG of deliberately allowing some of these smuggling operations to take place.Even as provisional state-lettes and cantons are conjured around it, there is no guarantee that Greater Kurdistan will ever see the light of day if Nation Builders Inc having anything to say bout it. The promise of Greater Kurdistan is as important to neocolonialists, than the reality of a Greater Kurdistan. Turkey also has its own interests and ambitions, and a Greater Kurdistan is not compatible with them. Iraq is not crazy about the idea either, because of obvious financial and energy resource reasons. So they remain in limb indefinitely, even as smaller quasi-Kurdish entities sprout up around the KRG. Turkey has its own ongoing  Kurdish problem  within Turkish borders, so Ankara will naturally view any expressions of Kurdish autonomy around it as a threat and potential inspiration for international Kurdish solidarity. Ruling over the Kurds means keeping them divided, and playing them off against their neighbors.There are those within the Turkish establishment who believe there are old scores still unsettled   in reclaiming Turk territory in both Syria and Iraq.SEE ALSO: SPECIAL REPORT: ISIS Oil? Follow the Money (Back to Europe)Here is where Sunnistan proper can emerge, coming into its own once set pieces are in place in Iraq and across Kurdistan, as Mike Whitney explained: So it looks like an agreement has been struck between Turkey, the KRG and the United States to seize parts of northern Iraq and eastern Syria to create a de facto Sunni state that will be jointly-controlled by Ankara and Washington.  It also looks like Obama has agreed to use dodgy jihadi-proxies (aka Terrorists) to work alongside US Special Forces to carry out future military operations.  So while the effort to remove Assad has been temporarily put on the backburner, the determination to destroy Syria is as strong as ever.  Another dismembered part of old Syria and Iraq which central planners are hoping to hack-off is an area called Rojava (see map above), or  Western Kurdistan . This region in northern Syria, formerly known as Syrian Kurdistan, gained its autonomy in November 2013 as part of the ongoing Rojava Revolution. The Kurdish defense forces here are known as the YPG (People s Defense Units) and are not on friendly footing with neighboring Turkey, for a number of reasons, not least of all because YPG defense forces present resistance to both al Nusra and ISIS encroachments into all three Rojava cantons. For Turkey, this is bad for business. How Rojava will factor into Washington s plans is not clear yet, but it occupies the most strategic squares on the chessboard.Make no mistake, the history s actors are all in for this plan. Do not be fooled by talk of  peace and stability  or humanitarian platitudes from western leaders, the UN, or the fair weather international community.Another indication that these plans have the full backing of the neoconservative illiterati, and Israel too, was PNAC walrus and former US Ambassador to the UN John Bolton s recent article in the establishment s daily journal of political posterity, the New York Times, where he states: Today s reality is that Iraq and Syria as we have known them are gone. The Islamic State has carved out a new entity from the post-Ottoman Empire settlement, mobilizing Sunni opposition to the regime of President Bashar al-Assad and the Iran-dominated government of Iraq. Also emerging, after years of effort, is a de facto independent Kurdistan. Central planners will happily frame this geopolitical scenario within the preferred theme of Sunni vs Shia  sectarian strife  in the region, which just happens to suit the interests and desires of both Saudi Arabia and Israel. Bolton confirms this: If, in this context, defeating the Islamic State means restoring to power Mr. Assad in Syria and Iran s puppets in Iraq, that outcome is neither feasible nor desirable. Rather than striving to recreate the post-World War I map, Washington should recognize the new geopolitics. The best alternative to the Islamic State in northeastern Syria and western Iraq is a new, independent Sunni state. Not so fast Mr. Ambassador. The Islamic State is the Sunni State.So for all intents and purposes, he s calling for the establishment of the Caliphate (funny how this goes right over the heads of  conservatives ). This is just one of many geostrategic moves which will guarantee instability and military conflict in the region for another 100 years, as well as provide a timely entr e through to Azerbaijan and into Iran, and later towards the Eurasian heartland of Dagestan (Russia s emerging energy center and geographic underbelly).In the meantime, expect to be pelted with endless propaganda about starving children in one town or another, changing week to week   with the usual slogans like,  we must act now! , and blaming Bashar al Assad for the suffering of his people. It s already wearing thin.Until the US and its NATO-GCC Axis stops flooding Syria and the region with weapons and terrorist fighters, and continues its policy of toppling secular nation-states   then any attempt at holding peace talks will end up back at square one, and stand as another exercise in futility.If the Syrian conflict has been good for one thing (and that s not to say it has), it s that the scripted western narrative, in all of its variations, has finally hit the wall of truth.***Author Patrick Henningsen is a writer, lecturer and global affairs analyst for international TV and radio.

23479,How to Blow $700 Million: Al Jazeera America Finally Calls it Quits,"21st Century Wire says Al Jazeera America will go down in history as one of the biggest failures in broadcast media history.Ever since the US and its allies began plotting to overthrow Libya and Syria, Al Jazeera has deteriorated from a promising international news network in 2003   into what it has become in 2016   a full-blown agit prop media shop for the US State Department and the Pentagon. In fact, US Military Central Command (CENTCOM) for the Middle East region is located in Qatar s capital of Doha, conveniently located just down the road from Al Jazeera s headquarters. Nice and cozy.Al Jazeera s role in promoting  regime change  and the destablization of Syria is now recorded history, as are its many shameful exhibitions of media fakery.The Qatari royals tried to expand propaganda operations into North America, but no matter how much money they threw at it (and those royals just love throwing money at things to try and get them to work), no one cared about it, much less watched it. I know this will be a massive disappointment for everyone here who has worked tirelessly for our long-term future. The decision that has been made is in no way because AJAM has done anything but a great job,  reads a company email from CEO Al Anstey, obtained by Politico.Indeed, they tried everything it seems, just short of paying Americans to watch their programs Al Jazeera America to close down https://t.co/EmFjBw9uC1 pic.twitter.com/HDea8ujTPt  Al Jazeera America (@ajam) January 13, 2016In 2012, the Qatari-owned Al Jazeera purchased Current TV from Al Gore for an inflated $500 million. Wait, it gets worse MONEY FOR NOTHING: Gore got fat off the AJAM deal.In addition to the $500 million which Doha blew on buying Gore s lemon, Current TV, the Qataris have spent at least $50 million per year between 2012   2015, along with many millions spent on advertising AJAM on other network slots, online ads, along with billboards and print media promotions. This was the Qataris   easy  ticket on to US cable and satellite networks. Boy, did Gore pull a fast one there.  In total, you would be looking at $700 million for the whole party. At its apex, AJAM would be lucky to pull in 30,000 viewers during prime time   which really amounts to a  nothing  market share.With all that money, and considering the hundreds of staff and  media executives  and producers they employed, it s safe to say that someone(s) did not have a clue what they were doing.What a colossal joke.On the bright side, the Qataris can always blame the collapse in oil prices for their lack of spare cash to fund their propaganda mills.READ MORE MAINSTREAM MEDIA EPIC FAILS AT: 21st Century Wire MSM Watch",Middle-east,"January 14, 2016"
23480,10 U.S. Navy Sailors Held by Iranian Military – Signs of a Neocon Political Stunt,"21st Century Wire says As 21WIRE predicted in its new year s look ahead, we have a new  hostage  crisis underway.Today, Iranian military forces report that two small riverine U.S. Navy boats were seized in Iranian waters, and are currently being held on Iran s Farsi Island in the Persian Gulf. A total of 10 U.S. Navy personnel, nine men and one woman, have been detained by Iranian authorities. NAVY STRAYED: U.S. Navy patrol boat in the Persian Gulf (Image Source: USNI)According to the Pentagon, the initial narrative is as follows: The sailors were on a training mission around noon ET when their boat experienced mechanical difficulty and drifted into Iranian-claimed waters and were detained by the Iranian Coast Guard, officials added. The story has since been slightly revised by White House spokesman Josh Earnest to follow this narrative:The 2 boats were traveling en route from Kuwait to Bahrain, when they were stopped and detained by the Iranians.According to USNI, search and rescue teams from the Harry S. Truman Strike group were scrambled to aid the crew but stopped short after the crew was taken by the Iranians. We have been in contact with Iran and have received assurances that the crew and the vessels will be returned promptly,  Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook told AP. According to Persian Gulf TV: Farsi Island is one of the Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf, Bushehr province of Iran. There is an IRGC Navy base on this Island. The island has an area of about 0.25 km  and is completely restricted to public, due to top secret governmental activities. According to NBC News, U.S. State Department is in touch with Tehran officials and the Iranians recognize that the U.S. Navy straying off course was a mistake, and that the sailors will be released  within hours.  WAR INC: CNN s Wolf Blitzer wasted no time in ramping-up talk of military tension with Israeli-financed neocon Senator Tom Cotton.Neocon StuntAlready, the U.S. media, including CNN and FOX, are running with the talking point that,  this could not have come at a worse time for President Obama right before tonight s State Of Union speech, when he s trying to prove to the American people that Iran is a country that can be trusted to implement the historic nuclear deal. This latest Naval  controversy  also comes days before the implementation phase of the Iran Nuclear Deal. To say this is a coincidence might be naive.That said, could GOP and Israel-aligned members of the Pentagon or intelligence establishment have helped to engineer today s bizarre  mini-crisis  in order to help weaken U.S.-Iran relations, and by extension, Obama s controversial Iranian Nuclear Deal?This looks likely to be the case, as evidenced by the quick appearance of the Israel Lobby-sponsored, pro-war U.S. Senator Tom Cotton (R), placed by CNN to direct aggressive U.S. military talking points live on air as the story broke today. Cotton (photo, left) immediately called the event  hostile  and blamed Iran for the U.S. boat drifting into Iranian waters, and then blamed the  crisis  on President Obama, who he claims,  has emboldened the Iranian aggression. Cotton then goes on to tell a giant lie, on which his media handler, CNN s Wolf Blitzer, does not even blink, much less challenge Cotton s imaginary statement: The Iranians, who are largely responsible for killing our (American) soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cotton then went on to threaten Iran, saying that: These sailors and both vessels  need to be immediately released. If they are not released, then the Iran (nuclear) deal should not go forward, and military force will be on the table to retaliate for this act of aggression.  Cotton then proceeded to give a veiled (nuclear?) threat to Iran, saying that,  All (military) options should be on the table.  Would Washington s top operatives go so far as to engineer or exacerbate an international crisis such as this   by dispatching the boats off course, knowing full-well that Iran would not harm U.S. personnel, but using the incident to injure a lame duck? The answer is  yes , and they ve done it before In 1979, 52 American diplomats and citizens were held hostage for 444 days in what became known as the Iranian Hostage Crisis, which just happened to take place during a US presidential election cycle, with then president Jimmy Carter (D) running for reelection against challenger Ronald Reagan (R). The crisis, including a horrific failed rescue attempt, was used against Carter in the media. According to reports at the time Reagan campaign operatives had managed to do a backdoor deal with the elements of the new Iranian regime to  hold-off  releasing the hostages until after the election. In the end, Reagan won and took credit for that  victory .Not surprisingly, at the end of his prearranged CNN segment, Cotton invoked the  feckless foreign policy  of Jimmy Carter which  caused  the 1979 Iran Hostage Crisis, and compared that to President Obama s current policy.Of all the U.S. Officials CNN could have brought in on  short notice , they chose Senator Tom Cotton, the most hawkish and closest aligned to Israel. Clearly, this looks like a neocon stunt.Stay tuned for more updates.READ MORE IRAN NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Iran Files",Middle-east,"January 12, 2016"
